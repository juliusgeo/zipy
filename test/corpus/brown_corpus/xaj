that most try to avoid, as long as they can see an alternative approach 
to the problem.   But if all alternatives should be clearly 
blocked 
off, it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps 
to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.

This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by 
the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature, so it would be more 
receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.   A constant problem 
confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge 
by his foes that he has not tried to economize.   Any tax bill 
also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using 
their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.

The new year might see some house-cleaning, either genuine or 
token, depending upon developments, to give Davis an opportunity to 
combat some of these criticisms.

City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the 
bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage 
of a private contracting company which had "an inside track" 
with the city.   Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 
job have ranged as high as $200,000. 

#'SHORTCUTS' UNNOTICED# 

Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co& contracted to 
do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than 
the "legitimate" bids of competing contractors.   The Hughes 
concern then took "shortcuts" on the project but got paid anyway, 
Hemphill said.   The Controller's charge of rigging was 
the latest development in an investigation which also brought these 
disclosures Tuesday:   {The city has sued for the full amount 
of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract.   The 
Philadelphia Transportation Co& is investigating the part its 
organization played in reviewing the project.   The signature of 
Harold V& Varani, former director of architecture and engineering 
in the Department of Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers 
certifying work on the project. Varani has been fired on charges of 
accepting gifts from the contractor.   Managing Director Donald 
C& Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a 
period of sharp disagreement on the matter}.   The announcement 
that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made 
by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following 
a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city 
and the ~PTC as well as representatives of an engineering firm that 
was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959. 

#CONCERN 
BANKRUPT#

The Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries, 
Inc&, both of 3646 N& 2d st&, filed for reorganization under 
the Federal bankruptcy law. On Monday, the Hughes concern was formally 
declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not 
draw up a plan for reorganization.   Business relations between 
the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and 
District Attorney James C& Crumlish, Jr&. 

#INTERVENES IN 
CASE#

The suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 
7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms. Travelers Indemnity 
Co& and the Continental Casualty Co&.   At Berger's 
direction, the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case 
in U& S& District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim 
there.   "I am taking the position that the contract was clearly 
violated", Berger said.   The contract violations mostly 
involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along 
the El track. The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints. 
The city paid for work on 75, of which no more than 21 were repaired, 
Hemphill charged. 

#WIDE RANGE IN BIDS#

Hemphill said the Hughes 
concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each 
joint. The bid from A& Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass&, 
which listed the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.

But, Hemphill added, bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 
to $3100 per joint.   Berger's decision to sue for the full 
amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning 
press conference. Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes 
company. "We won't know the full amount until we get a full 
report", Wagner said.   "We can claim on the maximum amount 
of the bond", Berger said.   Wagner replied, "Can't you 
just see the headline: 'City Hooked for $172,000'"? #'KNOW 
ENOUGH TO SUE'#

Berger insisted that "we know enough to 
sue for the full amount".   Douglas M& Pratt, president of 
the ~PTC, who attended the meeting, said the transit company is 
reviewing the work on the El.   "We want to find out who knew 
about it", Pratt said. "Certain people must have known about it".

"The ~PTC is investigating the whole matter", Pratt 
said.

Samuel D& Goodis, representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association, 
objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing 
fees, saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged 
from 48 to 74 percent last year.   Goodis voiced his objection before 
City Council's Finance Committee.   For hotels with 
1000 rooms, the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 
a year, Goodis said. 

#TESTIFIES AT HEARING#

His testimony came 
during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses, 
permits and city services. The new fees are expected to raise an additional 
$740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year 
after that.   The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming 
houses, hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room. The cost of a 
license now is $2, with an annual renewal fee of $1.   Goodis said 
that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some 
hotels. 

#REVENUE ESTIMATED#

The city expects the higher rooming 
house, hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 
a year.   The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan, 
spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia, on 
behalf of association members who operate apartment houses.   A 
proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman 
Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised pedigreed dogs. The ordinance 
would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat 
$5 a dog. 

#COMMISSIONER REPLIES#

Mrs& Knauer said she did not 
think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal 
care.   In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R& 
Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license 
and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees.   He reported 
that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 
to the Women's S&P&C&A&; $15,000 to pay six policemen 
assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites. 

#BACKS 
HIGHER FEES#

City Finance Director Richard J& McConnell 
indorsed the higher fees, which, he said, had been under study for more 
than a year. The city is not adequately compensated for the services 
covered by the fees, he said.   The new fee schedule also was 
supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman 
and Health Commissioner Eugene A& Gillis.

Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian 
W& Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court 
Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A& Davenport, counsel 
for the widow of the man killed last Nov& 1 by Barnard's hit-run 
car.   The petitions will be presented in open court to President 
Judge William F& Dannehower, Davenport said.   Barnard, 
who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges, was 
fined $500 by Judge Warren K& Hess, and placed on two years' probation 
providing he does not drive during that time. He was caught 
driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning.

Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery, 39. His 
widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded 
for violating the probation.

The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements 
between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase 
of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.

The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate 
traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.   One of 
the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp& to purchase a 1311 
acre tract for $12,192,865. The tract is bounded by Island ave&, 
Dicks ave&, 61st st&, and Eastwick ave&. 

#FOUR PARKS PLANNED# 

It is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment 
Authority's master plan and will feature row houses, garden apartments, 
four small parks, schools, churches, a shopping center and several 
small clusters of stores.   The corporation was formed by the 
Reynolds Metal Co& and the Samuel A& and Henry A& Berger 
firm, a Philadelphia builder, for work in the project.   The second 
agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of 
Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp&, 
a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders, which is interested 
in developing part of the project. 

#WOULD BAR VEHICLES#

The plan 
for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr& 
Constantinos A& Doxiadis, former Minister of Reconstruction 
in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp&.

The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would 
be barred to vehicular traffic. It provides for a series of landscaped
