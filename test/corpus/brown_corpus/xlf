In the daytime, on the other hand, since skywave transmission is relatively 
inefficient, it is possible to assign a substantially larger number 
of stations on these channels. Additional class /2, assignments 
for daytime operation can be made without causing destructive interference 
to the class /1, stations or to each other, and by their operation 
provide additional service on these channels and additional local 
outlets for a large number of communities. Such additional daytime 
class /2, assignments are appropriate if optimum use is to be made 
of these frequencies, and the Commission has over the years made a large 
number of them. Similarly, on the regional channels many class /3, 
stations have been assigned either to operate daytime only or to operate 
nighttime with directional antennas and/or lower power. _9._ 
Essentially, the question presented for decision in the present Daytime 
Skywave proceeding is whether our decision [in 1938-1939] to 
assign stations on the basis of daytime conditions from sunrise to sunset, 
is sound as a basis for ~AM allocations, or whether, in the light 
of later developments and new understanding, skywave transmission 
is of such significance during the hours immediately before sunset and 
after sunrise that this condition should be taken into account, and 
some stations required to afford protection to other stations during these 
hours. 

#THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDING#

_10._ The decision 
reached in 1938-39 was made after the accumulation of a large amount 
of data and thorough study thereof. Since then, there has been a notable 
increase in the number of stations and also the accumulation of additional 
data and the development of new techniques for using it, leading 
to a better understanding of propagation phenomena. In 1947, affidavits 
were filed with the Commission by various clear-channel stations 
alleging that extensive interference was being caused to the service 
areas of these stations during daylight hours, from class /2, stations 
whose signals were being reflected from the ionosphere so as to 
create skywave intereference. 
If you elect to use the Standard Deduction or the Tax Table, and 
later find you should have itemized your deductions, you may do so by 
filing an amended return within the time prescribed for filing a claim 
for refund. See <You May Claim a Refund>, Page 135. The same 
is true if you have itemized your deductions and later decide you should 
have used the Standard Deduction or Tax Table. The words {amended 
return} should be plainly written across the top of such return. 
_WHEN AND WHERE TO FILE_ April 15 is usually the final date 
for filing income tax returns for most people because they use the calendar 
year ending on December 31. If you use a fiscal year, a year ending 
on the last day of any month other than December, your return is 
due on or before the 15th day of the 4th month after the close of your 
tax year. _SATURDAY, SUNDAY, OR HOLIDAY._ If the last day (due 
date) for performing {any} act for tax purposes, such as filing a 
return or making a tax payment, etc&, falls on Saturday, Sunday, 
or a legal holiday, you may perform that act on the next succeeding day 
which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. Since April 15, 
1962, is on Sunday your return for the calendar year 1961 will be 
timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday, April 16, 1962.

{IF YOU MAIL A RETURN} or tax payment, you must place it 
in the mails in ample time to reach the district director on or before 
the due date. _DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAX._ If you were required 
to file a declaration of estimated tax for the calendar year 1961, 
it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment otherwise due on January 
15, 1962, if you file your income tax return Form 1040, and pay 
your tax in full for the calendar year 1961 by January 31, 1962. The 
filing of an original or amended declaration, otherwise due on January 
15, 1962, is also waived, if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and 
pay the full tax by January 31, 1962. Farmers, for these purposes, 
have until February 15, 1962, to file Form 1040 and pay the tax in 
full for the calendar year 1961. Fiscal year taxpayers have until the 
last day of the first month following the close of the fiscal year (farmers 
until the 15th day of the 2d month). See Chapter 38.   {Nonresident 
aliens living in Canada or Mexico} who earn wages in 
the United States may be subject to withholding of tax on their wages, 
the same as if they were citizens of the United States. Their 
United States tax returns are due April 16, 1962. However, if their 
United States income is not subject to the withholding of tax on wages, 
their returns are due June 15, 1962, if they use a calendar year, 
or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of their fiscal year. 
_NONRESIDENT ALIENS IN PUERTO RICO._ If you are a nonresident 
alien and a resident of Puerto Rico, your return is also due June 
15, 1962, or the 15th day of the 6th month after the close of your fiscal 
year.   {IF A TAXPAYER DIES,} the executor, administrator, 
or legal representative must file the final return for the decedent 
on or before the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of 
the deceased taxpayer's normal tax year. Suppose John Jones, who, 
for 1960, filed on the basis of a calendar year, died June 20, 1961. 
His return for the period January 1 to June 20, 1961, is due April 
16, 1962.   The return for a decedent may also serve as a claim 
for refund of an overpayment of tax. In such a case, Form 1310 should 
be completed and attached to the return. This form may be obtained 
from the local office of your district director.   {RETURNS 
OF ESTATES OR TRUSTS} are due on or before the 15th day of the 
4th month after the close of the tax year. _EXTENSIONS OF TIME FOR 
FILING._ Under unusual circumstances a resident individual may be 
granted an extension of time to file a return. You may apply for such 
an extension by filing Form 2688, <Application For Extension Of 
Time To File>, with the District Director of Internal Revenue 
for your district, or you may make your application in a letter. Your 
application must include the following information: (1) your reasons 
for requesting an extension, (2) whether you filed timely income tax 
returns for the 3 preceding years, and (3) whether you were required 
to file an estimated return for the year, and if so whether you did file 
and have paid the estimated tax payments on or before the due dates. 
Any failure to file timely returns or make estimated tax payments 
when due must be fully explained. Extensions are not granted as a matter 
of course, and the reasons for your request must be substantial. If 
you are unable to sign the request, because of illness or other good 
cause, another person who stands in close personal or business relationship 
to you may sign the request on your behalf, stating the reason 
why you are unable to sign. You should make any request for an extension 
early so that if it is refused, your return may still be on time. 
See also <Interest on Unpaid Taxes>, below. _EXTENSIONS WHILE 
ABROAD._ Citizens of the United States who, on April 15, are not 
in the United States or Puerto Rico, are allowed an extension of 
time until June 15 for filing the return for the preceding calendar 
year. An extension of 2 months beyond the regular due date for filing 
is also available to taxpayers making returns for a fiscal year. _ALASKA 
AND HAWAII._ Taxpayers residing or traveling in Alaska are also 
allowed this extension of time for filing, but those residing or traveling 
in Hawaii are {not} allowed this automatic extension.

{Military or Naval Personnel} on duty in Alaska or outside 
the United States and Puerto Rico are also allowed this automatic 
extension of time for filing their returns.   {You must attach 
a statement} to your return, if you take advantage of this automatic 
extension, showing that you were in Alaska or were outside the United 
States or Puerto Rico on April 15 or other due date. _INTEREST 
ON UNPAID TAXES._ Interest at the rate of 6% a year must be paid 
on taxes that are not paid on or before their due date. Such interest 
must be paid even though an {extension of time for filing} is granted. 
_WHEN PAYMENT IS DUE._ If your computation on Form 1040 or 
Form 1040~A shows you owe additional tax, it should be remitted 
with your return unless you owe less than $1, in which case it is forgiven. 
If payment is by cash, you should ask for a receipt. If you file 
Form 1040~A and the District Director computes your tax, you 
will be sent a bill if additional tax is due. This bill should be paid 
within 30 days. _PAYMENT BY CHECK OR MONEY ORDER._ Whether the 
check is certified or uncertified, the tax is not paid until the check 
is paid. If the check is not good and the April 15 or other due date 
deadline elapses, additions to the tax may be incurred. Furthermore, 
a bad check may subject the maker to certain penalties. All checks 
and money orders should be made payable to <Internal Revenue Service>. 
_REFUNDS._ An overpayment of income and social security taxes 
entitles you to a refund unless you indicate on the return that the 
overpayment should be applied to your succeeding year's estimated 
tax.   {If you file Form 1040~A} and the District Director 
computes your tax, any refund to which you are entitled will be 
mailed to you.   {If you file a Form 1040,} you should indicate 
in the place provided that there is an overpayment of tax and the 
amount you want refunded and the amount you want credited against your 
estimated tax.   {Refunds of less than $1} will not be made 
unless you attach a separate application to your return requesting such 
a refund. _WHERE TO FILE._ Send your return to the Director 
of Internal Revenue for the district in which you have your legal residence 
or principal place of business. If you have neither a legal residence 
nor a principal place of business in any internal revenue district, 
your return should be filed with the District Director of Internal 
Revenue, Baltimore 2, Md&. If your principal place of abode 
for the tax year is outside the United States (including Alaska 
and Hawaii), Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands and you have no legal 
residence or principal place of business in any internal revenue 
district in the United States, you should file your return with the 
Office of International Operations, Internal Revenue Service, Washington 
25, D&C&. _ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME_ The deductions 
allowed in determining Adjusted Gross Income put all taxpayers on 
a comparable basis. It is the amount you enter on line 9, page 1 of Form 
1040. Some deductions are subtracted from Gross Income to determine 
Adjusted Gross Income. Other deductions are subtracted only 
from Adjusted Gross Income in arriving at Taxable Income. 
{TO COMPUTE YOUR ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME} you total all items 
of income. (See Chapter 6.) From this amount deduct the items indicated 
below.   {Businessmen} deduct all ordinary and necessary 
expenses attributable to a trade or business. _RENTS OR ROYALTIES._ 
If you hold property for the production of rents or royalties you 
subtract, in computing Adjusted Gross Income, ordinary and necessary 
expenses and certain other deductions attributable to the property. 
(See Chapter 15.)   {Outside salesmen} deduct all expenses 
attributable to earning a salary, commission, or other compensation. 
(See Chapter 10.)   {Employees} deduct expenses of travel, 
meals and lodging while away from home in connection with the performance 
of their services as employees. They also deduct transportation 
expenses incurred in connection with the performance of services as employees 
even though they are not away from home. (See Chapter 12.) 
If your employer reimburses you for expenses incurred, you deduct such 
expenses if they otherwise qualify. (See Chapter 10.)   {Sick 
pay,} if included in your Gross Income, is deducted in arriving 
at Adjusted Gross Income. If your sick pay is not included in your 
Gross Income, you may not deduct it. (See Chapter 9.) _INCOME 
FROM ESTATES AND TRUSTS._ If you are a life tenant, you deduct allowable 
depreciation and depletion. If you are an income beneficiary of 
property held in trust or an heir, legatee, or devisee, you may deduct 
allowable depreciation and depletion, if not deductible by the estate 
or trust.   {Deductible losses on sales or exchanges} of 
property are allowable in determining your Adjusted Gross Income. (See 
Chapter 20.) _50% OF CAPITAL GAINS._ You also deduct 50% 
of the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital 
losses in determining Adjusted Gross Income. (See Chapter 24.) 
_OTHER DEDUCTIONS._ Certain other deductions are not allowed in 
determining Adjusted Gross Income. They may be claimed only by itemizing 
them on page 2 of Form 1040. These deductions may not be claimed 
if you elect to use the Standard Deduction or tax Table. (See 
Chapters 30 through 37.)
