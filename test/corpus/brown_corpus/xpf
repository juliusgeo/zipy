had not yet discussed the incident. "I think I've fixed the pump 
so we won't have to worry about it for a long time", he said. "I've 
adjusted the gauge so that the pump cuts out before the water 
gets too low".   "Fine", Rector said. He looked out over 
the expanse of the compound. It was going to take a lot of activity 
to fill it. "Have you ever operated a transit"? he said.

"No, sir", Johnson said.   "You are about to become a 
first-class surveyor", Rector said. "When Konishi gets back with 
the jeep, I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys. Konishi 
can help you. You'll find an old transit in the basement. The 
glass is out of it, but that won't matter. It looks pretty efficient 
and that's the important thing". He went on to explain what he 
had in mind. Johnson nodded. He said he could do it.   Rector 
was warming to his over-all strategy by the time he got back to the residential 
hall. It was rather a childish game, all in all, but everybody 
seemed to be getting into the spirit of the thing and he could not 
remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much. He was 
not sure what effect it would have, but that was really beside the point 
when you got right down to it. He was not going to lose the mission 
by default, and whatever reason Kayabashi had for bringing his little 
sight-seeing group to the mission, he was going to be in for a surprise.

He found Elizabeth in the parlor and asked her to make 
sure everything was in order in the residential hall, and then to take 
charge of the office while the party was here. When everything had been 
done, Rector went back to his desk to occupy himself with his monthly 
report until three o'clock.   At two thirty he sent Fujimoto 
to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to 
keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpsed 
the approach of Kayabashi's party. Then Rector, attired in his best 
blue serge suit, sat in a chair out on the lawn, in the shade of a 
tree, smoking a cigarette and waiting. The air was cooler here, and the 
lacy pattern of the trees threw a dappled shadow on the grass, an effect 
which he found pleasant.

She concluded by asking him to name another hour should this one 
be inconvenient.   The fish took the bait. He replied that he 
could not imagine what importance there might be in thus meeting with 
a stranger, but- joy of joys, he would be at home at the hour mentioned.

But when she called he had thought better of the matter 
and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement. She was told 
by the manservant who opened the door that his lordship was engaged 
on work from which he had left strict orders he was not to be disturbed. 
Claire was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff 
daunt her purpose. She wrote again and now, abandoning for the moment 
the theme of love, she asked for help in the matter of her career. 
She could act and she could write. His lordship was concerned in the 
management of Drury Lane but, if there were no opportunities there, 
would he read and criticize her novel?   At last he consented 
to meet her, and following that brief interview Claire wrote him a 
yet more remarkable proposal:   Have you any objection to the 
following plan? On Thursday evening we may go out of town together 
by some stage or mail about the distance of ten or twelve miles. There 
we shall be free and unknown; we can return the following morning 
**h   She concluded by asking for a brief interview- "to settle 
with you <where>"- and she threw in a tribute to his "gentle 
manners" and "the wild originality of your countenance".

She opened his reply with trembling fingers **h he agreed! And 
he would see her that evening. Victory at last!   At their 
meeting he told her not to bother about "where"- he would attend 
to that. There was one of the new forte-pianos in the room and, as 
Claire 
rose to go, he asked her to sing him one song before she left. 
She sang him Scott's charming ballad "Rosabelle", which was the 
vogue of the moment. She had never sung better.   "Your voice 
is delightful", he approved with a warm smile. "Tomorrow will 
be a new experience- I have never before made love to a nightingale 
**h. There have been cooing doves, chattering magpies, thieving jackdaws, 
a proud peacock, a silly goose, and a harpy eagle- whom I was 
silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals".

And so they went, he choosing of all places an inn near Medmenham 
Abbey, scene a generation ago of the obscene orgies of the Hellfire 
Club. He regaled Claire with an account of the mock mass performed 
by the cassocked bloods, which he had had at firsthand from old 
Bud Dodington, one of the leaders of the so-called "Order". Each 
wore the monkish scourge at his waist but this, it seems, was not 
employed for self-flagellation **h. Naked girls danced in the chancel 
of the Abbey, the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen 
to read a sermon filled with veiled depravities.   The jaded 
amorist conjured up pictures of the blasphemous rites with relish. Alas, 
all that belonged to the age of "Devil Dashwood" and "Wicked 
Wilkes", abbot and beadsman of the Order! The casual seduction 
of a seventeen-year-old bluestocking seemed tame by comparison.

They passed close by the turn to Bishopsgate. A scant half mile 
away Shelley and Mary were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace, 
the air about them scented with stock, and listening to the nightingale 
who had nested in the big lime tree at the foot of the garden. Charming 
and peaceful- but what were charm and peace compared to high adventure? 
Alone with the fabulous Byron! How many women had longed 
for the privilege that was hers.   How was she to behave, Claire 
wondered. To be passive, to be girlishly shy was palpably absurd. 
She was the pursuer as clearly as was Venus in Shakespeare's poem. 
And while her Adonis did not suffer from inexperience, satiety might 
well be an equal handicap. No, she would not pretend modesty, but 
neither must she be crudely bold. Mystery- that was the thing. In 
the bedroom she would insist on darkness. With his club foot he might 
well be grateful.   At the inn, which was situated close to a 
broad weir, Byron was greeted by the landlord with obsequious deference 
and addressed as "milord". The place was evidently a familiar 
haunt and Claire wondered what other illicit loves had been celebrated 
in the comfortable rooms to which they were shown.   The fire 
in the sitting room was lighted.   "What about the bedroom"? 
Byron inquired. "Seems to me last time I was here the grate bellowed 
out smoke as it might have been preparing us for hell".

"We found some owls had built a nest in the chimney, milord, but 
I promise you you'll never have trouble of that sort again".

So, not only had he been here before, but it seemed he might well 
come again. Claire felt suddenly small and cheap, heroine of a trivial 
episode in the voluminous history of Don Juan.   A cold supper 
was ordered and a bottle of port. When Napoleon's ship had borne 
him to Elba, French wines had started to cross the Channel, the first 
shipments in a dozen war-ridden years, but the supplies had not yet 
reached rural hostelries where the sweet wines of the Spanish peninsula 
still ruled.   As they waited for supper they sat by the 
fire, glasses in hand, while Byron philosophized as much for his own 
entertainment as hers.   "Sex is overpriced", he said. "The 
great Greek tragedies are concerned with man against Fate, not 
man against man for the prize of a woman's body. So don't see yourself 
as a heroine or fancy this little adventure is an event of major 
importance".   "The gods seemed to think sex pretty important", 
she rebutted. "Mars and Venus, Bacchus and Ariadne, Jupiter 
and Io, Byron and the nymph of the owl's nest. That would be 
Minerva, I suppose. Wasn't the owl her symbol"?   Byron 
laughed. "So you know something of the classics, do you"?

"Tell me about Minerva, how she behaved, what she did to please 
you".   "I'll tell you nothing. I don't ask you who 'tis 
you're being unfaithful to, husband or lover. Frankly, I don't 
care".   For a moment she thought of answering with the truth 
but she knew there were men who shied away from virginity, who demanded 
some 
degree of education in body as well as mind.   "Very well", 
she said, "I'll not catechize you. What matter the others so long 
as I have my place in history".   She was striking the right 
note. No man ever had a better opinion of himself and indeed, with 
one so favored, flattery could hardly seem overdone. Brains and beauty, 
high position in both the social and intellectual worlds, athlete, 
fabled lover- if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his.

The light supper over, Claire went to him and, slipping an arm 
about his shoulder, sat on his knee. He drew her close and, hand on 
cheek, turned her face to his. Her lips, moist and parted, spoke his 
name.   "Byron"!   His hand went to her shoulder and 
pushed aside the knotted scarf that surmounted the striped poplin gown; 
then, to better purpose, he took hold of the knot and with dextrous 
fingers, untied it. The bodice beneath was buttoned and, withdrawing 
his lips from hers, he set her upright on his knee and started to 
undo it, unhurriedly as if she were a child.   But, kindled by 
his kiss, his caressing hand, her desire was aflame. She sprang up and 
went swiftly to the bedroom. Lord Byron poured himself another glass 
of wine and held it up to the candle flame admiring the rich color. 
He drank slowly with due appreciation. It was an excellent vintage.

He rose and went to the bedroom. Pausing in the doorway he said: 
"The form of the human female, unlike her mind and her spirit, 
is the most challenging loveliness in all nature". ##

When Claire 
returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become 
Byron's mistress. By odd coincidence, on the evening of her return 
Shelley chose to read <Parisina>, which was the latest of the titled 
poet's successes. As he declaimed the sonorous measures, it was 
as much as Claire could do to restrain herself from bursting out with 
her dramatic tidings.   "Although it is not the best of which 
he is capable", said Shelley as he closed the book, "it is still 
poetry of a high order".   "If he would only leave the East", 
said Mary. "I am tired of sultans and scimitars". 
"The hero of his next poem is Napoleon Bonaparte", said Claire, 
with slightly overdone carelessness.   "How do you know that"? 
demanded Mary.   "I was told it on good authority", 
Claire answered darkly. "I mustn't tell, I mustn't tell", 
she repeated to herself. "I promised him I wouldn't". 

#CHAPTER

WINTER CAME, and with it Mary's baby- a boy as she 
had wished. William, he was called, in honor of the man who was at once 
Shelley's pensioner and his most bitter detractor. With a pardonable 
irony Shelley wrote to the father who had publicly disowned his 
daughter:   "Fanny and Mrs& Godwin will probably be glad 
to hear that Mary has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement, 
and that her child is well".   At the same time another 
child- this one of Shelley's brain- was given to the world: 
<Alastor>, a poem of pervading beauty in which the reader may gaze 
into the still depths of a fine mind's musings. <Alastor> was published 
only to be savagely attacked, contemptuously ignored. Shelley 
sent a copy to Southey, a former friend, and another to Godwin. Neither 
acknowledged the gift.   Only Mary's praise sustained him 
in his disappointment. She understood completely. Not a thought nor 
a cadence was missed in her summary of appreciation.   "You 
have made the labor worth while", he said to her, smiling. "And in 
the future, since I write for a public of one, I can save the poor
