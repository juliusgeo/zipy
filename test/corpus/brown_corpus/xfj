Fichte, and Tieck. He also met Count Rumford (born Benjamin 
Thompson in Woburn, Mass&) who was then serving the Elector 
of Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter; these were Oersted's main 
contacts in science.   From Go^ttingen (1801) where he stayed 
for 10 days, he wrote, "The first question asked everywhere is 
about galvanism. As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass 
tubes I have invented, I have had quite a small one made here of 
four glass 
tubes (in Copenhagen I used 30) and intend to carry it with me". 
Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks, continuing 
their correspondence after he left. With Ritter he was exposed 
to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's 
fertile but disorganized mind. Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes 
into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut de France 
for its annual prize of 3,000 francs. The sound discoveries of 
this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize 
was never awarded to him. In May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight 
of fancy, wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy. 
He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and 
indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided 
with the years of important electrical discoveries. Thus, 1745 corresponded 
to the invention of the "Leiden" jar by Kleist, 1764 
that of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser of 
Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile. Ritter proceeded, "You now emerge 
into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820, you will have 
to reckon. This we might well witness". Ritter died in 1810 and 
Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of 
it.   In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for 
the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably 
considered more a philosopher than a physicist. However, he continued 
experimenting and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments 
in German and Danish periodicals. In 1806 his ambition was 
realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University, 
though not realizing full professorship (ordinarius) until 1817.

During Oersted's attendance at the university, it was poorly 
equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences. 
He was, however, fortunate in his contact with Prof& J& G& 
L& Manthey (1769-1842), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to 
his academic chair, was 
also proprietor of the "Lion Pharmacy" in 
Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him. Manthey maintained a valuable 
collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's 
disposal during and after his graduation. In 1800, Manthey went 
abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy. In 
February 1801, Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus 
and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates 
of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates 
of zinc and lead. In the following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously 
with Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic 
battery more than did salts. Eager as he was to pursue this promising 
line, he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy 
and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university 
that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to "galvanizing".

He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and 
thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood. The 
university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor 
represented the upper social level. His broad interest in literary, political, 
and philosophical movements opened many doors to him. His friends 
were numerous and their ties to him were strong.   The years 
1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again, but on this 
visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his 
first journey. In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws 
of nature in German and this was issued in French translation (Paris, 
1813) under the title <Recherches sur l'identite des forces chimiques 
et electriques,> a work held in very high esteem by the new 
generation 
of research chemists. His interest in finding a relationship between 
voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated. Chapter 
/8, is entitled "On Magnetism" and in it are included such 
remarks as, "One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces 
with the electrical forces. The great resemblance between electrical 
and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their 
laws necessarily would bring about this comparison. It is true, that 
nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication; 
but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those 
depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest 
difference **h. The form of galvanic activity is halfway between 
the magnetic form and the electrical form. There, forces are more latent 
than in electricity, and less than in magnetism **h. But in such 
an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that 
the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity 
and magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is 
contrary to it **h. One could also add to these analogies that steel 
loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better 
conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do. 
It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature, as 
proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb. By that, one feels that magnetic 
forces are as general as electrical forces. An attempt should be made 
to see if electricity, in its most latent stage, has any action on the 
magnet as such". His plan and intent were clearly charted. 
Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and 
political discussions. In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment 
as opposed to dogma, in another he held that the practice of science 
was in fact an act of religious worship. He continued as a popular 
lecturer. He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was 
caused to glow by an electric current.   In 1819 under royal command 
he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm, 
one of the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in the expedition. 
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition, 
Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light 
by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric 
current was made to flow. Together they also developed a new 
form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of 
copper, thereby producing stronger currents. Esmarch was among those 
who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery. 

#DISCOVERY 
OF ELECTROMAGNETISM#

THE ASSOCIATION between electric 
(both electrostatic and voltaic) forces and magnetic forces had been 
recognized by investigators for many decades. Electrical literature 
contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and 
had altered the polarity of compass needles. In the late 1700's 
Beccaria and van Marum, among others, had magnetized iron by sending 
an electrostatic charge through it. Beccaria had almost stumbled on 
a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge 
from a Leyden jar was sent <transversally> through a piece 
of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic. The resulting magnetic 
effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise. 
The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but 
no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these 
two primary forces. Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive, 
possibly because he had, like other experimenters, laid the conducting 
wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.

The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains 
ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the 
university related that the first direct event that led to the publication 
of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made 
before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820. At 
this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel 
to a magnetic needle.
