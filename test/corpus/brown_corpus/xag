will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority 
given a candidate in recent years.   Sandman said: "The 
announcement that Sen& Clifford Case ~R-N&J&, has decided 
to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr& Mitchell 
is a dead giveaway. It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate 
who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's 
problems.   "We have witnessed in this campaign the effort 
to project Mr& Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from 
Washington. That failed.   "We are now witnessing an effort 
to transfer to Mr& Mitchell some of the glow of Sen& Case's 
candidacy of last year. That, too, will fail".   Sandman announced 
the appointment of Mrs& Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 
Woodland Ave&, Westfield, as state chairman of the Republican 
Women for Jones Committee.   Mrs& Greenfield is president 
of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county 
committeewoman.

County Supervisor Weldon R& Sheets, who is a candidate for 
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to 
paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them. The 
proposal, Sheets said, represents part of his program for election 
reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a "lip 
service word".   Sheets said that his proposed law would offer 
state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines, enabling 
counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge. 
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines 
in the state by January, 1964.   Although he pointed out 
that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful, 
he added that the vital interest in election results transcended 
county lines.

The candidacy of Mayor James J& Sheeran of West Orange, 
for the Republican nomination for sheriff 
of Essex County, was supported 
today by Edward W& Roos, West Orange public safety commissioner.

Sheeran, a lawyer and former ~FBI man is running 
against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder William 
MacDonald, for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy, 
now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals.   "My 
experience as public safety commissioner", Roos said, "has shown 
me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement 
experience, and preferably one who is a lawyer. Jim Sheeran fits 
that description". 

_TRENTON_- William J& Seidel, state fire warden in the Department 
of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired after 
36 years of service.   A citation from Conservation Commissioner 
Salvatore A& Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction 
in the number of forest fires in the state.   Seidel joined the 
department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 
from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment 
with private lumber companies. In October 1944, he was appointed 
state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section.   Under 
his supervision, the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques 
as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows 
and tractor units for fire fighting.   He also expanded and modernized 
the radio system with a central control station. He introduced 
regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training 
for section wardens. He is credited with setting up an annual 
co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross 
and State Department of Education. 

_BOONTON_- Richard J& Hughes made his Morris County debut 
in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night 
with a pledge "to carry the issues to every corner of the state".

He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members 
at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn: "When I come back here 
after the November election you'll think, 'You're my man- 
you're the kind of governor we're glad we elected'".   He 
said, "We Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what 
is right and just, and not what is expedient at the time". 

#ATTACKS 
REPUBLICANS#

In his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said, 
"The three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over 
their feet for popular slogans to win the primary. But we'll have 
a liberal, well planned, forward looking, honest platform. We'll not 
talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the 
other side in Hudson.   "We'll take the truth to the people, 
and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party 
in November".   He said, "You can see signs of the Republicans' 
feeble attack on the Meyner administration. But I shall 
campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead".

He urged New Jersey to "become a full partner in the courageous 
actions of President Kennedy". He called for a greater 
attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern 
states, and a strong fight against discrimination in business and 
industry.   "We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean", 
the former Superior Court judge said. "To prevent hoodlums 
from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration 
in the early 1940s".   Calling the Democrats the "party 
that lives, breathes and thinks for the good of the people", Hughes 
asked, "a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard 
toward victory in November".   Hughes supported Gov& 
Meyner's "Green Acres" plan for saving large tracts of open 
land from the onrush of urban development. He said legislation for 
a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be 
introduced Monday. 

#CONSERVATION PLAN#

The plan will provide $45 
million for purchase of open land by the state. The other $15 million 
is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis. 
Hughes said, "This is not a plan to conquer space- but to conserve 
it", pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each 
year since 1950. He said "Morris County is rapidly changing and 
unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be no 
land 
left to preserve".   Hughes would not comment on tax reforms 
or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved. He 
said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he 
was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans. "After the 
primary", he promised, "I'll be explicit on where I stand to 
bring you a strong, dynamic administration. I'm not afraid to tangle 
with the Republican nominee". 

_TRENTON_- Fifteen members of the Republican State Committee 
who are retiring- voluntarily- this year were honored yesterday by 
their colleagues.   The outgoing members, whose four-year terms 
will expire a week after the April 18 primary election, received carved 
wooden elephants, complete with ivory tusks, to remember the state 
committee by.   There may be other 1961 state committee retirements 
come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican 
voters.   A special presentation was made to Mrs& Geraldine 
Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35 years on 
the committee. She also was the original ~GOP national committeewoman 
from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's 
suffrage amendment. She served one four-year term on the national 
committee.

Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders 
and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided 
to seek a third term with Paul R& Screvane and Abraham D& Beame 
as running mates.   At the same time reaction among anti-organization 
Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's 
reported plan was generally favorable.   Some anti-organization 
Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal 
fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the 
last three years.   The resentment among Democratic organization 
leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at 
the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting 
the leaders. Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr& Wagner 
regarded himself as bigger than the party. 

#OPPOSITION REPORTED# 

Some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to 
induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr& 
Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept& 7 Democratic 
primary.   These contend there is a serious question as to whether 
Mr& Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file 
in the city. Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing 
to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of 
his performance as Mayor.   In an apparent effort to head off 
such a rival primary slate, Mr& Wagner talked by telephone yesterday 
with Representative Charles A& Buckley, the Bronx Democratic 
leader, and with Joseph T& Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic 
leader. 

#MAYOR VISITS BUCKLEY#

As usual, he made no attempt to get 
in touch with Carmine G& De Sapio, the Manhattan leader. He 
is publicly on record as believing Mr& De Sapio should be replaced 
for the good of the party.   Last night the Mayor visited Mr& 
Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation. 
Apparently he believes Mr& Buckley holds the key to the Democratic 
organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates 
without a struggle.   In talks with Mr& Buckley last week 
in Washington, the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent 
to dropping Controller Lawrence E& Gerosa, who lives in the 
Bronx, from this year's ticket. But Mr& Buckley seems to have 
assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr& Gerosa's successor. 

#SCREVANE AND BEAME HAILED#

The Mayor declined in two interviews 
with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he 
had decided to run and wanted Mr& Screvane, who lives in Queens, 
to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the candidate for President 
of the City Council and Mr& Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, to 
replace Mr& Gerosa as the candidate for Controller.   The 
Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter 
College Campus in the Bronx. After his speech, reporters asked 
him about the report of his political intentions, published in yesterday's 
New York Times. The Mayor said:   "It didn't 
come from me. But as I have said before, if I announce my candidacy, 
I will have something definite to say about running mates". 

_BOSTON, JUNE 16_- A wave of public resentment against corruption 
in government is rising in Massachusetts.   There is a tangible 
feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics. The taxi driver 
taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state 
are "all the same".   "It's 'See Joe, see Jim'",
