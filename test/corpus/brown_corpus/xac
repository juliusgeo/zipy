case load. The report called racial discrimination in employment "one 
of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and ~ADC 
dependency". #"MUST SOLVE PROBLEM"#

The monthly cost 
of ~ADC to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million 
dollars, said C& Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie 
Scott + Co&, committee chairman.   "We must solve the problems 
which have forced these people to depend upon ~ADC for subsistence", 
Martin said.   The volume of ~ADC cases will decrease, 
Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively 
with two problems: Relatively limited skills and discrimination 
in employment because of color. These, he said, are "two of the principal 
underlying causes for family breakups leading to ~ADC". 

#CALLS FOR EXTENSION#

Other recommendations made by the committee 
are:   Extension of the ~ADC program to all children in 
need living with any relatives, including both parents, as a means of 
preserving family unity.   Research projects as soon as possible 
on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.

Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made 
statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge 
James B& Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday. 
The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled 
observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six 
attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.

Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant 
his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial. Bellows made the request 
while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom. 

#FEARS PREJUDICIAL 
ASPECTS#

"The statements may be highly prejudicial to my 
client", Bellows told the court. "Some of the defendants strongly 
indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property. It is impossible 
to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements 
involving themselves and others".   Judge Parsons leaned over 
the bench and inquired, "You mean some of the defendants made statements 
admitting this"?   "Yes, your honor", replied 
Bellows. "What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all 
fight in this case. There is a conflict among the defendants". 
_WASHINGTON, JULY 24_- President Kennedy today pushed aside other 
White House business to devote all his time and attention to working 
on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the 
American people over nationwide television and radio.   The 
President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod 
writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of 
White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.

Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning 
from Hyannis Port, Mass&, a White House spokesman said 
the address text still had "quite a way to go" toward completion. 

#DECISIONS ARE MADE#

Asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White 
House press secretary, replied, "I would say it's got to go 
thru several more drafts".   Salinger said the work President 
Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address 
involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions 
on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated 
by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.

The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov& 8 election 
were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M& Karns, who 
charged that the prosecution obtained evidence "by unfair and fundamentally 
illegal means".   Karns said that the cases involved a 
matter "of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence" 
of the 50 persons. He said evidence was obtained "in violation of 
the legal rights of citizens".   Karns' ruling pertained to 
eight of the 10 cases. In the two other cases he ruled that the state 
had been "unable to make a case". Contempt proceedings originally 
had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J& 
Wexler, special prosecutor. 

#ISSUE JURY SUBPENAS#

Wexler 
admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas 
to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned 
the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them 
before the grand jury.   Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election 
judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure 
constituted intimidation. Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion 
was used in questioning.   Karns said it was a "wrongful act" 
for Wexler to take statements "privately and outside of the grand 
jury room". He said this constituted a "very serious misuse" 
of the Criminal court processes.   "Actually, the abuse of the 
process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook 
county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the 
function of this court", said Karns, who is a City judge in East 
St& Louis sitting in Cook County court. 

#FACED SEVEN CASES# 

Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 
persons. Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with 
"complementary" miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken 
from one candidate and given to another.   The cases involved 
judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st 
and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward, 
and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.   The case of the judges 
in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken 
under advisement by Karns. Two other cases also were under advisement. 

#CLAIMS PRECEDENT LACKING#

After reading his statement discharging 
the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases 
scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he 
would dismiss them. 
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth 
new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million 
American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other 
medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by 
social security or railroad retirement programs.   The President, 
in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan 
requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, 
build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child 
health care and general medical research.   The aged care plan, 
similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a 
fight on Capitol hill. It was defeated in Congress last year. 

#COST 
UP TO $37 A YEAR#

It would be financed by boosting the social security 
payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now 
paying such taxes.   The social security payroll tax is now 6 
per cent- 3 per cent on each worker and employer- on the first $4,800 
of pay per year. The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 
$5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent- 3.25 per cent each. 
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad 
retirement system.   The payroll tax would actually rise 
to 7.5 per cent starting Jan& 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because 
the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date 
to pay for other social security costs. 

#OUTLAYS WOULD INCREASE# 

Officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would 
amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would 
run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. Both figures would go 
higher in later years.   Other parts of the Kennedy health plan 
would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over 
the next 10 years. These would be paid for out of general, not payroll, 
taxes. 

#NURSING HOME CARE#

The aged care plan carries these 
benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad 
retirement systems: _1._ Full payment of hospital bills for 
stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would 
pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days. _2._ Full payment 
of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from 
a hospital. A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing 
home care under a "unit formula" allowing more of such care for those 
who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit. _3._ Hospital 
outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess 
of $20 a patient. _4._ Community visiting nurse services at home 
for up to 240 days an illness.   The President noted that Congress 
last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical 
bills of the needy aged. 

#CALLS PROPOSAL MODEST#

He said his 
plan is designed to "meet the needs of those millions who have no wish 
to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless 
staggered by the drain on their savings- or those of their children- 
caused by an extended hospital stay".   "This is a very 
modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said, 
"and with sufficient 'deductible' requirements to discourage any 
malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.   "This 
is not a program of socialized medicine. It is a program of prepayment 
of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed. Every 
person will choose his own doctor and hospital". 

#WOULDN'T 
PAY DOCTORS#

The plan does not cover doctor bills. They would still 
be paid by the patient.   Apart from the aged care plan the President's 
most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, 
and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.

The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools 
cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need 
for health care. Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are 
not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the 
schooling costs.
