and states. Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the 
world against anti-Semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous 
weapon. Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-Jew 
can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society 
into a menace to <all> his neighbors. Do patriots everywhere know 
enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in 
the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting 
apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest 
impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally 
forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them 
partners in unspeakable crimes? The career of Eichmann made the Trial 
a potential showcase for anti-Semitic demoralization: fearful 
of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform; 
clinging to the enemy-Jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of 
politeness and neighborliness; once in power he begins to give vent 
to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania 
and envy of those above him. "Is this the type of citizen you 
desire"? the Trial should have asked the nations. But though this 
characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor, 
more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a 
political one, would have none of it.   Finally, if the mission 
of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism, how could it have failed 
to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which 
the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters- i&e&, 
Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia- and those in which it 
met the obstacle of human solidarity- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, 
France? Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an 
outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-Semitism 
proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose 
citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports? Wasn't 
this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries 
worth highlighting? 
##

AS THE FIRST collective confrontation 
of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery 
of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen 
years and which is still by no means complete (though let no one 
believe that it could be hastened by silence). Only across a distance 
of time could the epic accounting begin. It is already difficult to 
recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to 
the Jews of Europe. It is not that the facts of the persecution were 
unavailable; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had 
been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and 
investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors' 
accounts. 
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, N& Y&, in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital 
presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the 
Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff. 
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended. After a flood of 
protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953. The peace 
of the community 
was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the 
incident, felt uneasy.   In New York City in 1958, the city's 
Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide 
a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device. He thereby precipitated 
a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman 
Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board 
of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.   A year 
later in Albany, N& Y&, a Roman Catholic hospital barred an 
orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood 
Association. Immediately, the religious groups of the city were 
embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's 
right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.   These incidents, 
typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no 
controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension, 
rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control 
issue. It has flared up periodically on the front pages of 
newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in 
municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies. It has erupted 
on the national level in the matter of including birth-control 
information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries. Where 
it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment 
like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.   The 
time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove 
this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life 
of our nation.   The first step toward the goal is the establishment 
of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication 
on other than the polemical level. Instead of emotional recrimination, 
loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study 
of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more 
serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is 
reached.   "All too frequently", points out James O'Gara, 
managing editor of <Commonweal>, "Catholics run roughshod over 
Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the 
reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their 
jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed 
in recent decades". All too often our language is unduly 
harsh.

The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement- 
frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting- 
already existing between Catholics and non-Catholics concerning the 
over-all objectives of family planning. Instead of Catholics' being 
obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number 
of offspring, as many non-Catholics imagine, the ideal of <responsible> 
parenthood is stressed. Family planning is encouraged, so that parents 
will be able to provide properly for their offspring.   Pope 
Pius /12, declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from 
the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the 
whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as 
those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and 
social "indications". This means that such factors as the health 
of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their 
children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density 
of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately 
be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.

These are substantially the same factors considered by non-Catholics 
in family planning. The laws of many states permit birth control 
only for medical reasons. The Roman Catholic Church, however, 
sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.   Catholics, 
Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of 
family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used. The Roman 
Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also 
known as the use of the infertile or safe period. The Church considers 
this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author: 
It involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent 
and disciplined use of them. With the exception of the Roman 
Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no 
moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives, 
allowing the couple free choice.   Here is a difference in 
theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement. The 
grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural (Old Testament), 
the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the 
unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest 
ecclesiastical authority and the natural law. The latter plays a prominent 
role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive, 
entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of 
birth-prevention methods.   The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition 
regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of 
the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual 
love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end. This conclusion 
is based on two propositions: that man by the use of his reason 
can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known 
His purpose by certain "given" physical arrangements.   Thus, 
man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal 
act is procreation, the propagation of the race. Moreover, man 
may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by 
God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for 
the control of conception. Believing that God is the Author of this 
law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are 
obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.   Let 
it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between 
Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable. But 
people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without 
taking up arms against those who disagree with them. Why is it 
so different in regard to birth control? It is because each side has 
sought to <implement> its distinctive theological belief through legislation 
and thus indirectly <force> its belief, or at least the practical 
consequences thereof, upon others.   It is always a temptation 
for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant 
one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint 
upon others. Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed 
to this temptation in the past.   Consider what happened during 
World War /1,, when the Protestant churches united to push the 
Prohibition law through Congress. Many of them sincerely believe 
that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically 
evil and sinful. With over four million American men away at war, Protestants 
forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general 
public. With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that 
the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens. The attempt 
to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, 
hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled 
in our history. The so-called "noble experiment" came to an 
inglorious end.   That tumultuous, painful and costly experience 
shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced 
when it has little correspondence with the general view of society. 
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control 
today.   Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned 
by <all> Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary 
to divine law. This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian 
countries. Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches 
stand virtually alone in holding that conviction. The various Lambeth 
Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual 
change that has taken place among Protestants generally. 
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception 
and issued "an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural 
means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers- 
physical, moral, and religious- thereby incurred, and against 
the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race". Denouncing 
the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference 
declared: "We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded 
as the governing considerations of Christian marriage. One is the 
primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance 
of the race through the gift and heritage of children; the other is 
the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful 
self-control". The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against 
the open or secret sale of contraceptives.   In 1930, the Lambeth 
Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be 
the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances, 
contraception might be morally legitimate.   In 1958, 
the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by 
God on parents everywhere.   Many other Protestant denominations 
preceded the Anglicans in such action. In March, 1931, 22 out 
of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified 
artificial methods of birth control. "As to the necessity", 
the committee declared, "for some form of effective control of the 
size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control 
of conception, there can be no question **h. There is general agreement
