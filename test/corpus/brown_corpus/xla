by executive action, with sufficient funds and made available from 
existing Mutual Security appropriations to permit a number of substantial 
projects to start this summer.   The Peace Corps should 
be launched soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualified 
people from this year's graduating classes will not be lost. Nor 
should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for training on university 
campuses.   If launched in a careful but determined way within 
the next few weeks, the Peace Corps could have several hundred 
persons in training this summer for placement next Fall. Within a year 
or two several thousand might be in service. It can then grow steadily 
as it proves itself and as the need for it is demonstrated.

WHAT WOULD THE FIRST PROJECTS BE?#

In the first year there should 
probably be considerable emphasis on teaching projects. The need here 
is most clearly felt and our capacity to recruit and train qualified 
volunteers in a short period of time is greatest.   There would, 
however, be a variety of other skills- medical, agricultural, engineering- 
which would be called for in the first year through the private 
agency programs and through the provision of technician helpers 
to existing development projects.   The first year's projects 
should also be spread through several countries in Latin America, 
Africa and Asia. 

#10. HOW WILL THE PEACE CORPS BE RECEIVED ABROAD?# 

Although the need for outside trained manpower exists in every 
newly developing nation, the readiness to receive such manpower, or to 
receive it from the United States will vary from country to country. 
A certain skepticism about the coming of Americans is to be expected 
in many quarters. Unfriendly political groups will no doubt do everything 
in their power to promote active hostility. But there are indications 
that many developing nations will welcome Peace Corps volunteers, 
and that if the volunteers are well chosen, they will soon demonstrate 
their value and make many friends.   It is important, however, 
that the Peace Corps be advanced not as an arm of the Cold War 
but as a contribution to the world community. In presenting it to 
other governments and to the United Nations, we could propose that 
every nation consider the formation of its own peace corps and that the 
United Nations sponsor the idea and form an international coordinating 
committee. We should hope that peace corps projects will be truly 
international and that our citizens will find themselves working alongside 
citizens of the host country and also volunteers from other lands. 
In any case, our Peace Corps personnel should be offered as technician 
helpers in development projects of the U&N& and other international 
agencies.   The Peace Corps is not a diplomatic or 
propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership. 
Our aim must be to learn as much as we teach. The Peace Corps 
offers an opportunity to bring home to the United States the problems 
of the world as well as an opportunity to meet urgent host country 
needs for trained manpower. If presented in this spirit, the response 
and the results will be immeasurably better. 

#11. HOW WILL IT BE 
FINANCED?#

The already appropriated funds within the discretion of 
the President and Secretary of State under the Mutual Security 
Act are the only immediately available source of financing this summer's 
pilot programs of the Peace Corps. If it is decided to make a 
small shift which may be required from military aid or special assistance 
funds, in order to carry out the purposes of the Mutual Security 
Act through this new peaceful program, this will be a hopeful sign 
to the world. Congress should then be asked to give the Peace Corps 
a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year.   Specifically, 
Congress should consider authorizing the Peace Corps to receive 
contributions from American businesses, unions, civic organizations 
and the public at large. For this must be the project of the whole 
American people. An Advisory Council of outstanding public figures 
with experience in world affairs should be formed to give the program 
continuing guidance and to afford a focal point for public understanding.

Steps should also be taken to link the Food for Peace 
Program with the Peace Corps, so that foreign currencies accumulated 
by the sale of U&S& surplus food under P&L& 480 can be 
put to use to pay some of the host country expenses of Peace Corps 
personnel.   The extent to which participating bodies such as U& 
S& voluntary agencies, universities, international organizations, 
and the host country or institutions in the host country can and should 
share the cost of the Peace Corps programs must be fully explored. 

#12. IS IT WORTH THE COST AND THE RISKS?#

No matter how well 
conceived and efficiently run, there probably will be failures. These 
could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad.

But as the popular response suggests, the potentiality of the 
Peace Corps is very great. It can contribute to the development of 
critical countries and regions. It can promote international cooperation 
and good will toward this country. It can also contribute to the 
education of America and to more intelligent American participation 
in the world.   With thousands of young Americans going to work 
in developing areas, millions of Americans will become more directly 
involved in the world than ever before.   With colleges and universities 
carrying a large part of the program, and with students looking 
toward Peace Corps service, there will be an impact on educational 
curriculum and student seriousness. The letters home, the talks later 
given by returning members of the Peace Corps, the influence on 
the lives of those who spend two or three years in hard work abroad- 
all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible 
American policies toward the world. And this is meeting the world's 
need, too, since what the world most needs from this country 
is better understanding of the world.   The Peace Corps thus can 
add a new dimension to America's world policy- one for which people 
here and abroad have long been waiting. As you said in your State 
of the Union message. "The problems **h are towering and unprecedented- 
and the response must be towering and unprecedented as well". 

#TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:#

I recommend to the Congress 
the establishment of a permanent Peace Corps- <a pool of trained 
American men and women sent overseas by the U&S& Government 
or through private organizations and institutions to help foreign 
countries meet their urgent needs for skilled manpower>.   I 
have today signed an Executive Order establishing a Peace Corps on 
a temporary pilot basis.   The temporary Peace Corps will be 
a source of information and experience to aid us in formulating more 
effective plans for a permanent organization. In addition, by starting 
the Peace Corps now we will be able to begin training young men and 
women for overseas duty this summer with the objective of placing them 
in overseas positions by late fall. This temporary Peace Corps is 
being established under existing authority in the Mutual Security 
Act and will be located in the Department of State. Its initial expenses 
will be paid from appropriations currently available for our foreign 
aid program.   Throughout the world the people of the newly 
developing nations are struggling for economic and social progress which 
reflects their deepest desires. Our own freedom, and the future 
of freedom around the world, depend, in a very real sense, on their ability 
to build growing and independent nations where men can live in dignity, 
liberated from the bonds of hunger, ignorance and poverty.

One of the greatest obstacles to the achievement of this goal is 
the lack of trained men and women with the skill to teach the young and 
assist in the operation of development projects- men and women with 
the capacity to cope with the demands of swiftly evolving economics, 
and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the villages, 
the mountains, the towns and the factories of dozens of struggling nations.

The vast task of economic development urgently requires 
skilled people to do the work of the society- to help teach in the 
schools, construct development projects, demonstrate modern methods of 
sanitation in the villages, and perform a hundred other tasks calling 
for training and advanced knowledge.   To meet this urgent need 
for skilled manpower we are proposing the establishment of a Peace 
Corps- an organization which will recruit and train American volunteers, 
sending them abroad to work with the people of other nations.

This organization will differ from existing assistance programs 
in that its members will supplement technical advisers by offering the 
specific skills needed by developing nations if they are to put technical 
advice to work. They will help provide the skilled manpower necessary 
to carry out the development projects planned by the host governments, 
acting at a working level and serving at great personal sacrifice. 
There is little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve 
will be far greater than our capacity to absorb them. 
_WILDLIFE HABITAT RESOURCES_ In 1960 one-quarter of the 92.5 million 
recreation visits to the National Forests and Grasslands were for 
the primary purpose of hunting and fishing. Hunter and fisherman visits 
since 1949 have increased 8 times faster than the nationwide sale 
of hunting and fishing licenses. This use is expected to increase to 
about 50 million visits by 1972. The long-range objective of habitat 
management is to make it fully productive so as to support fish and 
game populations to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment.

The wildlife habitat management proposals for the 10-year period 
are: _1._ Revise and complete wildlife habitat management 
and improvement plans for all administrative units, assuring proper coordination 
between wildlife habitat management and other resources. _2._ 
Inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resources in cooperation 
with other Federal agencies and with the States in which National 
Forests and Grasslands are located, as a basis for orderly development 
of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination programs, including 
(a) big-game, gamebird, and small-game habitat surveys and investigations 
on the 186 million acres of National Forests and Grasslands, 
(b) fishery habitat surveys and investigations on the 81,000 miles 
of National Forest fishing streams and nearly 3 million acres of lakes 
and impoundments, and (c) participation in planning, inspection, and 
control phases of all habitat improvement, land- and water-use projects 
conducted on National Forest lands by States, other Federal agencies, 
and private groups to assure that projects will benefit wildlife 
and be in harmony with other resource values. _3._ Improve food 
and cover on 1.5 million acres of key wildlife areas. _4._ Develop 
wildlife openings, food patches, and game ways in dense vegetation 
by clearing or controlled burning on 400,000 acres. _5._ Improve 
7,000 miles of fishing streams and 56,000 acres of lakes by stabilizing 
banks, planting streamside cover, and constructing channel improvements. 

#PROTECTION#

The total adverse impact of disease, insects, 
fire, weather, destructive animals, and other forces on the uses and 
values of forest resources is not generally recognized. They kill and 
destroy, retard or prevent reproduction and growth, impair and damage 
values, and disrupt uses.   The loss in growth of sawtimber because 
of damage by destructive agencies in the United States in 1952 
was estimated to be about 44 billion board feet. If it were not for the
