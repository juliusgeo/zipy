performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company 
is every bit as good, and perhaps better.   Certainly in the matter 
of principals there is nothing lacking. Bob Carroll may not bear 
quite as close a physical resemblance to LaGuardia as Tom Bosley 
does, but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello 
as the evening progressed, until one had to catch one's self up and 
remember that this wasn't really LaGuardia come back among us again.

Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben, the distraught 
Republican Party district chieftain. And Paul Lipson, as Morris, 
the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner, was 
fine, too.   As for the ladies, they were full of charm, and sincerity, 
and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving, honest, 
little man. Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie, 
who became the second Mrs& LaGuardia, singing and acting with 
remarkable conviction. Jen Nelson, as Thea, his first wife, managed 
to make that short role impressive. And little Zeme North, a Dora 
with real spirit and verve, was fascinating whether she was singing of 
her love for Floyd, the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then 
is promoted into garbage, or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings.

Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual 
treatment of "On the Side of the Angels" and "Politics and Poker" 
were handled splendidly, and I thought Rudy Bond and his band 
of tuneful ward-heelers made "Little Tin Box" even better than 
it was done by the New York cast; all the words of its clever 
lyrics came through with perfect clarity.   The party at Floyd's 
penthouse gave the "chorines" a chance for a nostalgic frolic 
through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic 
statement of the era's nonsense.   LaGuardia's multi-lingual 
rallies, when he is running for Congress, are well staged, 
and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical 
theater.   Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for 
himself as a successful stager of touring productions. Not a corner 
has been visibly cut in this one. The sets are remarkably elaborate 
for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place, and they 
are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness. 
(Several times recently I have wondered whether shows were 
being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience 
with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their 
eyes. I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this 
"Fiorello!")   It has all been done in superb style, 
and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts 
who enjoys good musical theater.

{LOEW'S THEATER} presents {"Where the Boys are"}, 
an ~MGM picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed 
by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells. The cast: @

Since the hero, a sterling and upright fellow, is a rich Brown 
senior, while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists, I suppose 
I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on "Where the 
Boys are", but I shall do nothing of the sort.   Instead- 
and not just to prove my objectivity- I hasten to report that it's 
a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of 
reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort 
Lauderdale, and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with 
the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group- 
that is to say, sex.   The answers the girls give struck 
me as reasonably varied and healthily individual. If most of them weren't 
exactly specific- well, that's the way it is in life, I guess. 
But at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't 
profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems 
instead.   "Where the Boys Are" also has a juvenile bounce 
that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy. There are some sharp 
and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations- the best 
of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where 
a "mermaid" is performing.   Most of the female faces are 
new, or at least not too familiar. Dolores Hart, is charming in a leading 
role, and quite believable. I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' 
comedy performance, which was as fresh and unstilted as one's 
highest hopes might ask. A couple of the males made good comedy, too- 
Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin.   The only performance which 
was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux, but since someone 
had to become the victim of despoilers, just to emphasize that such things 
do happen at these fracases, I suppose this was the attitude the 
part called for. I must say, however, that I preferred the acting that 
had something of a biting edge to it.   To anyone who remembers 
Newport at its less than maximum violence, this view of what the 
boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz 
Festival ought to prove entertaining.   The second feature, 
{"The Price of Silence"}, is a British detective story that 
will talk your head off.

The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James 
was never more evident than in his letters. Here was a man with an 
enormous gift for living as well as thinking. To both persons and ideas 
he brought the same delighted interest, the same open-minded relish 
for what was unique in each, the same discriminating sensibility and 
quicksilver intelligence, the same gallantry of judgment.   For 
this latest addition to the Great Letters Series, under the general 
editorship of Louis Kronenberger, Miss Hardwick has made a selection 
which admirably displays the variety of James's genius, not 
to mention the felicities of his style. And how he could <write!> 
His famous criticism of brother Henry's "third style" is surely 
as subtly, even elegantly, worded an analysis of the latter's intricate 
air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced. His letter 
to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant, 
forthright, and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up 
penned to a sensitive child, and with just the right tone of unpatronizing 
good humor. #@#

Most of all, his letters to his philosophic 
colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help 
to explain Whitehead's reference to James as "that adorable genius". 
Miss Hardwick speaks of his "superb gift for intellectual 
friendship", and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life 
lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.

This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where 
there seems to be an increasing lack of communication- or even desire 
for communication- between differing schools of thought. It holds 
an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word "intellectual" 
has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people 
who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human 
virtues.   To his Harvard colleague, Josiah Royce, whose philosophic 
position differed radically from his own, James could write, 
"Different as our minds are, yours has nourished mine, as no other 
social influence ever has, and in converse with you I have always felt 
that my life was being lived importantly".   Of another colleague, 
George Santayana, he could write: "The great event in 
my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book. Although 
I absolutely reject the Platonism of it, I have literally squealed 
with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position 
is laid down on page after page". #@#

Writing to his colleague 
George Herbert Palmer- "Glorious old Palmer", as he addresses 
him- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really 
understand Royce, Santayana, Palmer, and himself and see that 
their varying systems are "so many religions, ways of fronting life, 
and worth fighting for", then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic 
universe. "The best condition of it would be an open conflict 
and rivalry of the diverse systems **h. The world might ring with the 
struggle, if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other".

The "belaboring" is of course jocular, yet James was 
not lacking in fundamental seriousness- unless we measure him by 
that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who 
stakes all on his vision of God. To James this vision never quite 
came, despite his appreciation of it in others.   But there is a 
dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one 
correspondent: 
"You ask what I am going to 'reply' to Bradley. 
But why need one reply to everything and everybody? **h I think 
that readers generally hate <minute> polemics and recriminations. 
All polemic of ours should, I believe, be either very broad statements 
of contrast, or fine points treated singly, and as far as possible 
impersonally **h. As far as the rising generation goes, why not simply 
express ourselves positively, and trust that the truer view quietly 
will displace the other. Here again 'God will know his own'".

The collected works of James Thurber, now numbering 25 volumes 
(including the present exhibit) represent a high standard of literary 
excellence, as every schoolboy knows. The primitive-eclogue quality 
of his drawings, akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall, 
is equally well known. About all that remains to be said is that the 
present selection, most of which appeared first in The New Yorker, 
comprises (as usual) a slightly unstrung necklace, held together by little 
more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the 
book.   The one unifying note, if any, is sounded in the initial 
article entitled: "How to Get Through the Day". It is repeated 
at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs, 
the hospitalized, and others forced to rely on inner resources, 
including (in the ~P's alone) "palindromes", "paraphrases", 
and "parodies".   "The Tyranny of Trivia" suggests 
arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber. And new vistas 
of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled: 
"Friends, Romans, Countrymen, Lend Me Your Ear-Muffs", 
"Such a Phrase as Drifts Through Dream", and "The New Vocabularianism". 
Some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong 
potions of mixed metaphor, malapropism, and gobbledygook and are recommended 
for use only in extreme cases. #@#

A burlesque paean 
entitled: "Hark the Herald Tribune, Times, and All the Other 
Angels Sing" brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture 
ballyhooey. "How the Kooks Crumble" features an amusingly 
accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-~TV 
commercials, and "The Watchers of the Night" is a veritable 
waking nightmare.   A semi-serious literary document entitled 
"The Wings of Henry James" is noteworthy, if only for a keenly 
trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult 
later period by modest Owen Wister, author of "The Virginian". 
James, he remarks in a letter to a friend, "is attempting the impossible 
**h namely, to produce upon the reader, as a painting produces 
upon the gazer, a number of superimposed, simultaneous impressions. He 
would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you 
could read them all at once, and get all at once, the various shadings 
and complexities".   Equally penetrating in its fashion is 
the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation: 
"So much has already been written about everything that you can't 
find out anything about it". Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance 
(also a quotation): "Woman's place is in the wrong". Who 
but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences?

A tribute to midsummer "bang-sashes" seems terribly funny, 
though it would be hard to explain why. "One of them banged the sash 
of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped 
out of sleep and out of bed. 'It's just a bat' said my wife reassuringly,
