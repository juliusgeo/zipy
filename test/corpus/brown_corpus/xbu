there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after 
independence for which history may not find them guiltless. 
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no 
fewer than 120 political parties, or approximately eight for each university 
graduate. There were four principal ones. First, there were those 
Congolese (among them Joseph Kasavubu) who favored splitting the 
country into small independent states, Balkanizing it. Second, there 
were those (Moise Tshombe) who favored near-Balkanization, a loose 
federalism having a central government of limited authority, with 
much power residing in the states. Third, there were those (notably Patrice 
Lumumba) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central 
government. And fourth, there were moderates who were in no hurry 
for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up. However, 
the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.

A final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation 
of the Congo, immediately after independence, was the provincial structure 
that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration. 
They had divided the Congo into six provinces- Leopoldville, 
Kasai, Kivu, Katanga, Equator and Eastern- unfortunately 
with little regard for ethnic groupings. Thus some provinces contained 
tribes which detested each other, and to them independence meant 
an opportunity for war.   The Belgian Congo was granted its independence 
with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government: 
there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral legislature 
elected by universal suffrage in the provinces. Well-wishers 
around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable 
position in the society of nations. If internal frictions arose, 
they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army, the <Force 
Publique>, which had been trained and was still officered by white 
Belgians. The president, Joseph Kasavubu, seemed an able administrator 
and the premier, Patrice Lumumba, a reasonable man.   Twenty-four 
hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting 
each other. Presently the well-armed members of the <Force Publique>- 
many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes, 
erupted in mutiny, rioting, raping and looting. Terror engulfed the thousands 
of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country. The Belgian 
government decided to act, and on July 10 dispatched paratroops 
to the Congo. On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of 
Katanga, Moise Tshombe, announced that his province had seceded from 
the country. Confusion became chaos; each succeeding day brought 
new acts of violence. Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military 
intervention by the Belgians, and appealed to the United Nations 
to send troops to oust them. ##

On July 14 the Security 
Council- 
with France and Great Britain abstaining- voted the resolution 
which drew the U&N& into the Congo. Vague in wording, it 
called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-General 
"to take the necessary steps **h to provide the [Congolese] 
Government with such military assistance as may be necessary, until, 
through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical 
assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces 
may be able, in the opinion of the Government, to meet fully their tasks 
**h".   Secretary-General Hammarskjo^ld decided that it 
would be preferable if the U&N& troops sent into the Congo were 
to come from African, or at least nonwhite, nations- certainly not 
from the U&S&, 
Russia, Great Britain or France. He quickly 
called on Ghana, Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea and Mali, which dispatched 
troops within hours. Ultimately the U&N& army in the Congo 
reached a top strength of 19,000, including about 5,000 from India 
and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden, who were the only whites.

It took the U&N& three months to bring a modest form of 
order to the Congo. The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops 
and often obstructed U&N& efforts. The wildly erratic nature 
of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems- he frequently announced 
that he wanted the U&N& to get out of the Congo along with 
the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help. (However, there is 
little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist. Before appealing 
to the U&N& or to Russia, he first appealed to the U&S& 
for military help, and was rejected.) Lumumba further complicated 
the U&N&'s mission by initiating small "wars" with the 
secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under 
Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well. Meanwhile Russia took every 
opportunity to meddle in the Congo, sending Lumumba equipment for 
his "wars", dispatching "technicians" and even threatening, 
on occasion, to intervene openly.   But by the end of the three-month 
period, in October 1960, something approaching calm settled on 
the Congo. President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and 
fired him. Lumumba fired Kasavubu. Control of the government- such 
control as there was and such government as there was- passed into 
the hands of Joseph Mobutu, chief of staff of the Congolese army. 
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians, who have not since played any 
significant part on the local scene, although they have redoubled their 
obstructionist efforts at U&N& headquarters in New York. 
The Belgians- at least officially- departed from the Congo as well, 
withdrawing all of their uniformed troops. But they left behind 
them large numbers of officers, variously called "volunteers" or 
"mercenaries", who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga, 
the seceded province which, according to Tshombe, holds 65% of 
the mineral wealth of the entire country.   From October 1960 
to February 1961, the U&N& forces in the Congo took little action. 
There was no directive for it- the Security Council's resolution 
had not mentioned political matters, and in any case the United 
Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political 
affairs of any nation, whether to unify it, federalize it or Balkanize 
it.   During the five-month lull, civil war smoldered and 
flickered throughout the Congo. In February the murder of Patrice 
Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of 
Tshombe, again stirred the U&N& to action. On Feb& 21 the 
council passed another resolution urging the taking of "all appropriate 
measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo, including 
**h the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort". Although 
the resolution might have been far more specific, it was considerably 
tougher than the earlier one. It also urged that the U&N& 
eject, and prevent the return of, all Belgian and other foreign military 
and political advisers; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's 
death; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the 
reorganization of the army. 

#THE PRESIDENCY: TALKING AND LISTENING#

Though President John 
F& Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin 
and disarmament adviser McCloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev, 
his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved 
him in other key problems of U&S& foreign policy last week.

High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question 
of Bizerte. On this issue, the President received a detailed 
report from his U&N& Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, who had just 
returned from Paris, and Mr& Kennedy asked Stevenson to search 
for a face-saving 
way- for both Paris and Tunis- out of the imbroglio. 
Ideally, the President would like the French to agree on a "status 
quo ante" on Bizerte, and accept a new timetable for withdrawing 
their forces from the Mediterranean base. To continue their important 
conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of 
other problems, Mr& Kennedy invited stevenson to Cape Cod for 
the weekend.

The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with 
the No& 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense Minister Bahi 
Ladgham, who flew to Washington last week to seek U&S& support. 
The conversation apparently convinced Mr& Kennedy that the 
positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable. Through Ladgham, 
Mr& Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian 
President Habib Bourguiba; and one U&S& official said: "The 
key question now is which side picks up the phone first".

On the Latin American front, the President held talks with Secretary 
of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay 
and the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (which the President 
himself had originally hoped to attend). Main purpose of the 
meeting: To discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress.

And that was not all. In conferences with Nationalist China's 
dapper, diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng, Mr& Kennedy 
assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U&S& is as 
firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United 
Nations. Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission 
of Outer Mongolia; however the President, who would like to woo 
the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow, would 
promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U&S& if Outer 
Mongolia's admission comes to a vote.   The President 
also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking 
more foreign aid. To Africa, he sent his most trusted adviser, 
his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on a good-will mission 
to the Ivory Coast. All week long the President clearly was playing 
a larger personal role in foreign affairs; in effect, he was practicing 
what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he 
declared: 
"We shall always be prepared to discuss international problems 
with any and all nations that are willing to talk, and listen, with 
reason". 

#CRIME: 'SKYJACKED'#

From International Airport 
in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston, as the 
great four-jet Boeing 707 flies, is a routine five hours and 25 minutes, 
including stopovers at Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio. When 
Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one 
night last week, there was no reason to think it would take any longer.

The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a&m& in Phoenix. 
Thirty-one minutes later, when it took off for El Paso, hardly 
anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention 
to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard. At 3:58 a&m&, 
with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso, passenger Robert 
Berry, a San Antonio advertising man, glanced up and saw the 
man and boy, accompanied by a stewardess, walking up the aisle toward 
the cockpit. "The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach", 
Berry said. "I figured he was sick".   John Salvador, a 
farmer from Palm Desert, Calif&, was sitting up front and could 
see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit. "The kid had 
a .45 automatic, like they issue in the Army", he said. "The other 
fellow had a .38". Salvador saw the youth hold his .45 against the 
head of stewardess Lois Carnegey; the man put his .38 at the head 
of Capt& Byron D& Rickards.   To Rickards, a 52-year-old 
veteran 30 years in the air, it was an old story: His plane was 
being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930, when 
Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa. But 
last week's pirates, like the Cuban-American who recently hijacked 
an Eastern Airlines Electra (NEWSWEEK, Aug& 7), wanted to 
go to Havana. _STALLING:_ "Tell your company there are four 
of us here
