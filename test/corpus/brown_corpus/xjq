behavior. In this sense also, they are surely conformists. It is 
even true that some among them use the sheer fact of conformity- "everyone 
does it"- as a criterion for conduct. But the extent of 
ethical robotism is easily overestimated. Few students are really so 
faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swelling population in our 
institutions of higher learning. And it may be well to recall that to 
say 
"conformity" is, in part, another way of saying "orderly human 
society".   In the field of religious beliefs and values, the 
college students seem to faithfully reflect the surrounding culture. 
Their commitments are, for the most part, couched in a familiar idiom. 
<Students testify to a felt need for a religious faith or ultimate 
personal philosophy. Avowed atheists or freethinkers are so rare as 
to be a curiosity>. The religious quest is often intense and deep, 
and there are students on every campus who are seriously wrestling with 
the most profound questions of meaning and value. At the same time, 
a major proportion of these young men and women see religion as a means 
of personal adjustment, an anchor for family life, a source of emotional 
security. These personal and social goals often overshadow the 
goals of intellectual clarity, and spiritual transcendence. The "cult 
of adjustment" does exist. It exists alongside the acceptance of 
traditional forms of organized religion (church, ordained personnel, 
ritual, dogma). Still another segment of the student population consists 
of those who seek, in what they regard as religion, intellectual clarity, 
rational belief, and ethical guidance and reinforcement.

Our first impression of the data was that the students were surprisingly 
orthodox and religiously involved. Upon second thought we were 
forced to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmarks 
against which we might compare the present situation, and that conclusions 
that present-day students are "more" or "less" religious 
could not be defended on the basis of our data. As we looked more intently 
at the content of our belief and the extent of religious participation, 
we received the impression that many of the religious convictions 
expressed represented a conventional acceptance, of low intensity. 
But, here again, comparative benchmarks are lacking, and we do not 
know, in any case, what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect 
from healthy, young, secure and relatively inexperienced persons; 
after all, feelings of immortality and invulnerability are standard illusions 
of youth. Nor are optimistic and socially-oriented themes at 
all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country. 
Kluckhohn recently has summarized evidence regarding changes in values 
during a period of years, primarily 1935-1955, but extending much farther 
back in some instances. A variety of data are assembled to bear 
upon such alleged changes as diminished puritan morality, work-success 
ethic, individualism, achievement, lessened emphasis on future-time 
orientation in favor of sociability, moral relativism, consideration and 
tolerance, conformity, hedonistic present-time orientation. Although 
he questions the extent and nature of the alleged revival of religion 
and the alleged increase in conformity, and thinks that "hedonistic" 
present-time orientation does not have the meaning usually attributed 
to it, he does conclude that Americans increasingly enjoy leisure 
without guilt, do not stress achievement so much as formerly, are more 
accepting of group harmony as a goal, more tolerant of diversity and 
aware of other cultures.

From New Jersey, Morgan hastened to the headquarters of Washington 
at Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, arriving there on November 18th. 
There was much sickness in the corps, and the men were, in addition, 
without the clothing, shoes, and blankets needed for the winter weather. 
Morgan himself had sciatica again. Even on his tough constitution, 
the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest.

On the morning of November 17th, Cornwallis and 2,000 
men had left Philadelphia with the object of capturing Fort Mercer 
at Red Bank, New Jersey. In order to prevent this, Washington hastened 
to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort, including a force 
under the Marquis de Lafayette containing some 160 of Morgan's 
riflemen, all who were fit for duty at this time, the rest having no shoes. 
Although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of Cornwallis, 
Morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing 
at the redcoats. A picket guard of about 350, mostly Hessians, were 
attacked by the Americans under Lafayette, and driven back to their 
camp, some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire.

"I never saw men", Lafayette declared in regard to the 
riflemen, "so merry, so spirited, and so desirous to go on to the 
enemy, whatever force they might have, as that small party in this fight". 
Nathanael Greene told Washington that "Lafayette was charmed 
with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen". 
A few days later it was learned that General Howe was planning an 
attack upon the American camp. The British general moved his forces 
north from Philadelphia to Chestnut Hill, near the right wing of 
the patriot encampment. Here the Pennsylvania militia skirmished with 
the British, but soon fled. Morgan was ordered to attack the enemy, 
who had meantime moved to Edge Hill on the left of the Americans. 
Similar orders were given to the Maryland militia. Morgan immediately 
disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait. 
A body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope, a tempting 
target for the riflemen, who threw a volley into their ranks and "messed 
up" the smart formation considerably. Now the riflemen and the 
Marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the British, 
giving them another telling round of fire. The redcoats ran like 
rabbits. But the Maryland militia had likewise fled, all too typical 
of this type of soldier during the Revolution, an experience which gave 
Morgan little confidence in militia in general, as he watched other 
instances of their breaking in hot engagements. The British, although 
suffering considerable losses, noted the defection of the Marylanders, 
made a stand, then turned and attacked Morgan who became greatly 
outnumbered and had to retire.   The Americans lost forty-four 
men, among them Major Joseph Morris of Morgan's regiment, an 
officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection, not only by his 
commander, but by Washington and Lafayette as well. The latter was 
so upset on learning of the death of Morris, that he wrote Morgan 
a letter, showing his own warmhearted generosity. After complimenting 
Morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to Congress, 
too, the ardent Frenchman added he felt that Congress should make 
some financial restitution to the widow and family of Morris, but that 
he 
knew Morgan realized how long such action usually required, if it was 
done at all. "As Mrs& Morris may be in some want before that 
time", Lafayette continued, "I am going to trouble you with a commission 
which I beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy. If 
she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of 
Congress, it would not become a stranger, unknown to her, to offer himself 
for that purpose. But you could (as from yourself) tell her that 
you had friends who, being with the army, don't know what to do with 
their money and **h would willingly let her have one or many thousand 
dollars". This was accordingly done, and the plight of the grateful 
Mrs& Morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan, 
the amount of which is not known.   Apparently still sensitive 
about the idea with which General Gates had approached him at Saratoga, 
namely, that George Washington be replaced, Morgan was vehement 
in his support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around 
Philadelphia. Richard Peters, Secretary of the Board of War, thought 
Morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying 
to pick a quarrel. Morgan hotly denied this and informed the Board 
of War that the men in camp linked the name of Peters with the plot 
against Washington. Peters insisted that this impression was a great 
misunderstanding, and evidently, from the quarrel, obtained an unfavorable 
impression of Morgan's judgment. Such a situation regarding 
the Board of War could hardly have helped Morgan's chances for 
promotion when that matter came before the group later on.   In 
late December, the American army moved from Whitemarsh to Valley 
Forge, and although the distance was only 13 miles, the journey took 
more than a week because of the bad weather, the barefooted and almost 
naked men. The position of the new camp was admirably selected and 
well fortified, its easily defensible nature being one good reason why 
Howe did not attack it. Besides helping to prevent the movement of 
the British to the west, Valley Forge also obstructed the trade between 
Howe's forces and the farmers, thus threatening the vital subsistence 
of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary 
supplies extremely hazardous. In order to see that this hindering 
situation remained effective, Washington detached several bodies of his 
troops to the periphery of the Philadelphia area.   Morgan and 
his corps were placed on the west side of the Schuylkill River, with 
instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and 
to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy. The headquarters 
of Morgan was on a farm, said to have been particularly well located 
so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the British, a 
practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for 
British gold rather than the virtually worthless Continental currency. 
In his dealings with offenders, however, Morgan was typically 
firm but just. For example, he captured some persons from York County, 
who with teams were taking to Philadelphia the furniture of a man 
who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife, 
and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household 
goods. Morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its 
thankful owners, but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free.

Morgan complained to Washington about the men detailed to him 
for scouting duty, most of them he said being useless. "They straggle 
at such a rate", he told the commander-in-chief, "that if the 
enemy were enterprising, they might get two from us, when we would take 
one of them, which makes me wish General Howe would go on, lest any 
incident happen to us".   If the hardships of the winter at 
Valley Forge were trying for healthy men, they were, of course, much 
more so for those not in good health. Daniel Morgan's rheumatic condition 
worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather. He 
had braved the elements and the enemy, but the strain, aided by the winter, 
was catching up with him at last. Also, he was now forty-three 
years old. The mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the 
troops at Valley Forge could be handled by a subordinate, he felt, 
so like Henry Knox, equally loyal to Washington, who went to Boston 
at this time, Morgan received permission to visit his home in Virginia 
for several weeks. In his absence, the rifle regiment was under 
the command of Major Thomas Posey, another able Virginian. 
But Morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a William 
Pickman in Salem, Massachusetts, apparently an acquaintance, praising 
Washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were 
"opposed by the general current of the people **h to exalt General 
Gates at the expense of General Washington was injurious to the latter. 
If there be a disinterested patriot in America, 'tis General 
Washington, and his bravery, none can question".   It is doubtful 
if Morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children, 
for his pay, as shown by the War Department Abstracts of early 
1778 was $75 a month as a colonel, and that apt to be delayed. He 
was shown a warm welcome regardless, and spent the time in Winchester 
recuperating from his ailment, enjoying his family and arranging his 
private affairs which were, of course, run down. His neighbors celebrated 
his return, even if it was only temporary, and Morgan was especially 
gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend, Isaac 
Lane, who told him, "A man that has so often left all that is dear 
to him, as thou hast, to serve thy country, must create a sympathetic 
feeling in every patriotic heart".   There must have been special 
feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of Daniel Morgan too, 
when the news was received on April 30th of the recognition by France 
of the independence of the United States. His fellow Virginian, 
George Washington, had stated, "I believe no event was ever received 
with more heartfelt joy". The dreary camp at Valley Forge
