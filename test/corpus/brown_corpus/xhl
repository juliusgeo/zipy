efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to 
win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.   During the first 
administration of Bienville, the peltry trade of the Mobile district 
was a lucrative source of revenue. The Alabamas brought in annually 
15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought 
the total up to 50,000 pelts. These deerskins were the raw material 
for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the 
tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods. 
During his first administration, Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina 
traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country. The 
director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French 
goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian 
needs. The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which 
goods could be moved quickly and cheaply. De la Laude, commander 
of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able 
to make them look upon the British as poor competitors. Diron d'Artaguette, 
the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and 
resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors. 
He became, after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama 
River, but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district, 
and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade.   The 
Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district. 
Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama, 
the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was 
easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees. In 1720 some 
Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them, and did not 
make peace for four years. Venturesome traders, however, continued to 
come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts 
for the French markets. British traders from South Carolina incited 
the Indians against the French, and there developed French and 
British Factions in the tribe. The Chickasaws finally were the occasion 
for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana. 
To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they 
controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile. 
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region, 
from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French 
settlements near the Gulf.   Bienville realized that if the French 
were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British 
goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant 
as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices. His urgings brought 
some results. The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply 
of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms 
of deerskins. But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians 
must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation 
into and out of the Indian country.   The insistence of Bienville 
upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive 
back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall 
in 1724. For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained 
as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance. 
Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, 
and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.

The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina, 
and when Perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special 
instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district. But the 
Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements 
to furnish better goods at attractive prices. To the directors 
the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy. Perier 
attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among 
the Indians. These agents were to ascertain the difference between 
English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians. They 
were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to 
incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina. They were 
to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant 
supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering. 
Perier's intrigues gained some successes. The savages divided 
into two factions; one was British and the other, French. So hostile 
did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke 
out.   Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective 
in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided 
to send troops into the troubled country. He asked the government 
for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest 
English traders and disloyal Indians. In spite of the company's 
restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory. He asked 
also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' 
pelts.   No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation, 
gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'Artaguette. 
D'Artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many 
hunters. But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon 
French trade in the region was at an end. Perier finally, in one 
last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent 
above the cost in France. The Indians were not impressed and held 
to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the 
Mississippi.   With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended 
all profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted. They destroyed 
a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed French shipping 
on the Mississippi. The war to subdue them taxed the resources 
of the colony and piled up enormous debts. In January, 1731, the company 
asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony. 
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently 
blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade. It offered 
to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity. 
The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the 
company at 1,450,000 livres. Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana 
was free to all Frenchmen.   Company rule in Louisiana left the 
colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies. The difficulties 
of trade had ruined many <voyageurs>, and numbers of them 
had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families. Others 
left the country, and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade. 
If this trade should be resumed, the <habitants> who had come 
to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must 
be hardened to the severe life of <coureurs de bois>. This was a 
slow and difficult course, and French trade suffered from the many mistakes 
of the new group of traders. These men were without capital or 
experience.   Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either 
to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown 
furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts 
with pelts. Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected 
that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing 
a trade in which they could see no hope of profits. He reported, too, 
that among the <habitants> there were none of probity and ability 
sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods. He did 
find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers 
to trade. With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all 
the traders.   In order to compete with English traders, Bienville 
radically changed the price schedule. The King should expect 
no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France, 
which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all 
he charged the traders. 
They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned 
a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense. 
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if 
it were the source of such reports. Few things are more perilous for 
the State Department than a displeased congressman.   The reason 
for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends 
so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are 
so available. First, the State Department is unique among government 
agencies for its lack of public supporters. The farmers may be aroused 
if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget. Businessmen 
will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department. 
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department; the 
Chamber of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury. A kaleidoscope of 
pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly 
toward the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The congressman's 
patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense 
Department. Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every 
voter who can write.   With all these agencies, the congressman 
must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly. 
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon 
the State Department in anger.   In many sections he may even 
reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson. After 
all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer, 
or the businessman, but to <foreigners>. Not only do these foreigners 
not vote for American congressmen; they are also probably 
ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty. And are not the State Department 
men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders 
who have never met a payroll? Will not the righteous congressman 
be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America 
and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes? 
The chances are excellent that he will.   The result is 
that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is 
the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever 
the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife. People in this 
position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the 
newspapers. State keeps the junketeering list a secret.   The 
Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion. 
Congress is a harsh master. State is expected to arrange the 
touring Cicero's foreign itinerary; its embassies are expected 
to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way; embassy workers 
are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with 
their savings for the children's college tuition.   But come 
the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer 
guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money 
for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for 
its diplomats. The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his 
wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-Dame will 
systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance 
for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.

In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during 
the Eisenhower years was Representative John J& Rooney, of 
Brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses. 
Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful 
coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney. Nothing 
worked. In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of 
techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around- friendly persuasion, 
groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful 
congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic 
corps. Rooney remained untouched.   "The trouble" explained 
Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration, 
"is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing, 
it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we 
do".   One year the Department collected a file of case histories 
to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's 
entertainment bills out of personal income. News of the 
project reached the press. Next day, reports went through the Department 
that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt 
to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances 
and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not 
rise a dollar. They didn't.   The Department's constant 
fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic 
bloody engagements with the Senate. Armed with constitutional 
power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries 
a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's 
back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.   With 
its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by 
keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it 
did with Dean Acheson. John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his 
personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then 
operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition. During
