down to the bottom and goes all the way to the top. I hope no one 
expects that only Presidential appointees are looked upon as sources 
of ideas. The responsibility for taking the initiative in generating 
ideas is that of every officer in the Department who has a policy function, 
regardless of rank.   Further, I would hope that we could 
pay attention to little things. While observing the operations of 
our Government in various parts of the world, I have felt that in many 
situations where our policies were good we have tended to ignore minor 
problems which spoiled our main effort. To cite only a few examples: 
The wrong man in the wrong position, perhaps even in a junior 
position 
abroad, can be a source of great harm to our policy; the attitudes 
of a U&N& delegate who experiences difficulty in finding adequate 
housing in New York City, or of a foreign diplomat in similar 
circumstances in our Capital, can be easily be directed against the United 
States and all that it stands for. Dozens of seemingly small 
matters go wrong all over the world. Sometimes those who know about them 
are too far down the line to be able to do anything about them. I 
would hope that we could create the recognition in the Department and 
overseas that those who come across little things going wrong have the 
responsibility for bringing these to the attention of those who can 
do something about them.   If the Department of State is to take 
primary responsibility for foreign policy in Washington, it follows 
that the ambassador is expected to take charge overseas. This does 
not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active, operational, 
interested, responsible fashion. He is expected to know about what 
is going on among the representatives of other agencies who are stationed 
in his country. He is expected to supervise, to encourage, to direct, 
to assist in any way he can. If any official operation abroad begins 
to go wrong, we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and 
to get suggestions for remedial action. 

#THE PROBLEMS OF A POLICY OFFICER# 

It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts 
which I expressed privately in recent years, in the hope of clearing 
up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy 
is all about and what it means, and of developing a certain compassion 
for those who are carrying such responsibilities inside Government. 
I tried to do so by calling to their attention some of the problems 
that a senior departmental policy officer faces. This means practically 
everybody in this room. Whether it will strike home for you or not 
will be for you to determine.   The senior policy officer may 
be moved to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of 
stimuli: an idea in his own head, the suggestions of a colleague, 
a question from the Secretary or the President, a proposal by another 
department, a communication from a foreign government or an American 
ambassador abroad, the filing of an item for the agenda of the United 
Nations or of any other of dozens of international bodies, a news 
item read at the breakfast table, a question to the President or the 
Secretary at a news conference, a speech by a Senator or Congressman, 
an article in a periodical, a resolution from a national organization, 
a request for assistance from some private American interests abroad, 
et cetera, ad infinitum. The policy officer lives with his antennae 
alerted for the questions which fall within his range of responsibility.

His first thought is about the question itself: Is 
there a question here for American foreign policy, and, if so, what is 
it? For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job 
is to know what the question is- that when it is accurately identified 
it sometimes answers itself, and that the way in which it is posed 
frequently shapes the answer.   Chewing it over with his colleagues 
and in his own mind, he reaches a tentative identification of the 
question- tentative because it may change as he explores it further 
and because, if no tolerable answer can be found, it may have to be changed 
into one which can be answered.   Meanwhile he has been thinking 
about the facts surrounding the problem, facts which he knows can 
never be complete, and the general background, much of which has already 
been lost to history. He is appreciative of the expert help available 
to him and draws these resources into play, taking care to examine 
at least some of the raw material which underlies their frequently 
policy-oriented conclusions. He knows that he must give the expert his 
place, but he knows that he must also keep him in it.   He is 
already beginning to box the compass of alternative lines of action, 
including doing nothing. He knows that he is thinking about action in 
relation to a future which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful 
fog. But he takes his bearings from the great guidelines of policy, 
well-established precedents, the commitments of the United States 
under international charters and treaties, basic statutes, and well-understood 
notions of the American people about how we are to conduct 
ourselves, in policy literature such as country papers and National Security 
Council papers accumulated in the Department.   He will 
not be surprised to find that general principles produce conflicting 
results in the factual situation with which he is confronted. He must 
think about which of these principles must take precedence. He will 
know that general policy papers written months before may not fit his 
problem because of crucial changes in circumstance. He is aware that 
every moderately important problem merges imperceptibly into every other 
problem. He must deal with the question of how to manage a part 
when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole- when the whole 
is too large to grasp.   He must think of others who have a 
stake in the question and in its answer. Who should be consulted among 
his colleagues in the Department or other departments and agencies 
of the Government? Which American ambassadors could provide helpful 
advice? Are private interests sufficiently involved to be consulted? 
What is the probable attitude of other governments, including 
those less directly involved? How and at what stage and in what sequence 
are other governments to be consulted?   If action is indicated, 
what kind of action is relevant to the problem? The selection 
of the wrong tools can mean waste, at best, and at worst an unwanted 
inflammation of the problem itself. Can the President or the Secretary 
act under existing authority, or will new legislation and new money 
be required? Should the action be unilateral or multilateral? 
Is the matter one for the United Nations or some other international 
body? For, if so, the path leads through a complex process of parliamentary 
diplomacy which adds still another dimension to the problem. 

#RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS OF MANKIND#

What type of action can 
hope to win public support, first in this country and then abroad? 
For the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret 
and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be conditioned 
by the readiness of the country to sustain it. He is interested in 
public opinion for two reasons: first, because it is important in itself, 
and, second, because he knows that the American public cares about 
a decent respect for the opinions of mankind. And, given probable 
public attitudes- about which reasonably good estimates can be made- 
what action is called for to insure necessary support?   May 
I add a caution on this particular point? We do not want policy 
officers below the level of Presidential appointees to concern themselves 
too much with problems of domestic politics in recommending foreign 
policy action. In the first place our business is foreign policy, 
and it is the business of the Presidential leadership and his appointees 
in the Department to consider the domestic political aspects of 
a problem. Mr& Truman emphasized this point by saying, "You fellows 
in the Department of State don't know much about domestic politics".

This is an important consideration. If we sit here 
reading editorials and looking at public-opinion polls and other reports 
that cross our desks, we should realize that this is raw, undigested 
opinion expressed in the absence of leadership. What the American 
people will do turns in large degree on their leadership. We cannot 
test public opinion until the President and the leaders of the country 
have gone to the public to explain what is required and have asked them 
for support for the necessary action. I doubt, for example, that, 
3 months before the leadership began to talk about what came to be the 
Marshall plan, any public-opinion expert would have said that the country 
would have accepted such proposals.   The problem in the 
policy officer's mind thus begins to take shape as a galaxy of utterly 
complicated factors- political, military, economic, financial, legal, 
legislative, procedural, administrative- to be sorted out and handled 
within a political system which moves by consent in relation to 
an external environment which cannot be under control.   And the 
policy officer has the hounds of time snapping at his heels.

While there should be no general age limit or restriction to one 
sex, there will be particular projects requiring special maturity and 
some open only to men or to women. The Peace Corps should not pay 
the expenses of a wife or family, unless the wife is also accepted for 
full-time Peace Corps work on the same project.   There should 
be no draft exemption because of Peace Corps service. In most cases 
service in the Corps will probably be considered a ground for temporary 
deferment.   Peace Corps volunteers obviously should not 
be paid what they might earn in comparable activities in the United 
States. Nor would it be possible in many cases for them to live in 
health or any effectiveness on what their counterparts abroad are paid. 
The guiding principle indeed should not be anything like compensation 
for individual services.   Rather the principle should be akin 
to that of the allowance. Peace Corps volunteers should be given 
just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of living. They should 
live in modest circumstances, avoiding all conspicuous consumption. 
Wherever possible they should live with their host country counterparts. 
Some special health requirements might have to be met. For example, 
it probably will be necessary for the Corps to have authority to 
pay medical expenses of volunteers. Perhaps existing Public Health 
Service, State Department and Armed Services medical facilities 
can be utilized.   For readjustment to the U&S&, volunteers 
should be given some separation allowance at the end of their overseas 
service, based on the length of time served. 

#7. IN WHAT PART OF 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD THE PEACE CORPS BE ESTABLISHED?#

The idea 
of a Peace Corps has captured the imagination of a great many people. 
Support for it cuts across party, regional, ethnic and other lines. 
The Peace Corps, therefore, offers an opportunity to add a new dimension 
to our approach to the world- an opportunity for the American 
people to think anew and start afresh in their participation in world 
development.   For this, the Peace Corps should be administered 
by a small, new, alive agency operating as one component in our whole 
overseas operation.   Pending the reorganization of our foreign 
aid structure and program, the Peace Corps should be established 
as an agency in the Department of State. When the aid operations are 
reorganized the Peace Corps should remain a semi-autonomous, functional 
unit. Meanwhile, the Peace Corps could be physically located 
in ~ICA's facilities and depend on the State Department and 
~ICA for administrative support and, when needed, program assistance.

In this way the Peace Corps can be launched with its own 
identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those 
now responsible for United States foreign policy and our overseas 
operations. 

#8. HOW AND WHEN SHOULD THE PEACE CORPS BE LAUNCHED?# 

The Peace Corps can either begin in very low gear, with only preparatory 
work undertaken between now and when Congress finally appropriates 
special funds for it- or it can be launched now and in earnest
