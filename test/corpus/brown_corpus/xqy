walkin'", Lord drawled, "seein' as how I got a busted front 
spring. On the other hand, howsomever, maybe you wouldn't either. 
I figger it's probl'y a sixty-five-mile walk, and I c'n maybe 
get this spring patched up in a couple of hours".   "How- 
with what? There's nothing out here but rattlesnakes". 
"Now, ain't it the truth"? Lord laughed with secret amusement. 
"Not a danged thing but rattlesnakes, so I reckon I'll get 
the boss rattler to help me".   "Tom! For God's sake"!

"Looky". He pointed, cutting her off. "See 
that wildcat"?   She saw it then, the distant derrick of the 
wildcat- a test well in unexplored country. And even with her limited 
knowledge of such things, she knew that the car could be repaired 
there; sufficiently, at least, to get them back into town. A wildcatter 
had to be prepared for almost any emergency. He had to depend on 
himself, since he was invariably miles and hours away from others.

"Well, let's get going", she said impatiently. "I"- 
She broke off, frowning. "What did you mean by that rattlesnake 
gag? Getting the boss rattlesnake to help you"?   "Why, 
I meant what I said", Lord declared. "What else would I mean, 
anyways"?   She looked at him, lips compressed. Then, with 
a shrug of pretended indifference, she took a compact from her purse 
and went through the motions of fixing her make-up. In his mood, it 
was the best way to handle him; that is, to show no curiosity whatsoever. 
Otherwise, she would be baited into a tantrum- teased and provoked 
until she lost control of herself, and thus lost still another battle 
in the maddening struggle of Tom Lord Vs& Joyce Lakewood.

The car lurched along at a snail's crawl, the left-front mudguard 
banging and scraping against the tire, occasionally scraping against 
the road itself. Lord whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering 
wheel. He seemed very pleased with himself, as though some intricate 
scheme was working out exactly as he had planned. Along with this 
self-satisfaction, however, Joyce sensed a growing tension. It poured 
out of him like an electric current, a feeling that the muscles and 
nerves of his fine-drawn body were coiling for action, and that that 
action would be all that he anticipated.   Joyce had seen him like 
this once before- more than once, actually, but on one particularly 
memorable occasion. That was the day that he had practically mopped 
up the main street of Big Sands with Aaron McBride, field boss 
for the Highlands Oil + Gas Company.   Tom had been laying 
for Aaron McBride for a long time, just waiting to catch him out of 
line. McBride gave him his opportunity when he showed up in town with 
a pistol on his hip. He had a legitimate reason for wearing it. It 
was payday for Highlands, and he was packing a lot of money back into 
the oil fields. Moreover, as long as the weapon was carried openly, 
the sheriff's office had made no previous issue of it.   "So 
what's this all about"? he demanded, when Lord confronted him. 
I'm not the only man in town with a gun, or the only one without 
a permit".   It was the wrong thing to say. By failing to do 
as he was told instantly- to take out a permit or return the gun to 
his car- he had played into Lord's hands.   The trouble was 
that he had virtually had to protest. The deputy had forced him to 
by his manner of accosting him.   So, "How about it"? he 
said. "Why single me out on this permit deal"?   "Well, 
I'll tell you about that", Lord told him. "We aim t' be see-lective, 
y'know? Don't like to bother no one unless we have 
to, which I figger we do, in your case. Figger we got to be plumb careful 
with any of you Highlands big shots".   McBride reddened. 
He himself had heard that there was gangster money in the company, 
but that had nothing to do with him. He was an honest man doing a hard 
job, and the implication that he was anything else was unbearable.

"Look, Lord", he said hoarsely. "I know you've got 
a grudge against me, and maybe I can't blame you. You think that Highlands 
swindled you and I helped 'em do it. But you're all wrong, 
man! I'm no lawyer. I just do what I'm told, and"-

"Uh-huh. An' that could mean trouble with a fella that's 
workin' for crooks. So you get rid of that pistol right now, Mis-ter 
McBride. You do that or take you out a permit right now".

McBride couldn't do either, of course. Not immediately, as the 
deputy demanded. Not without a face-saving respite of at least a few 
minutes. To do so would make his job well-nigh impossible. Oil-field 
workers were a rough-tough lot. How could he exert authority over 
them- make them toe the line, as he had to- if he knuckled under to 
this small-town clown?   "I'll get around to it a little 
later", he mumbled desperately. "Just as soon as I go to the bank, 
and"-   "Huh-uh. <Now,> Mis-ter McBride", said 
Lord, and he laid a firmly restraining hand on the field boss's arm.

It was strictly the deputy's game, but McBride had gone 
too far to throw in. Now, he could only play the last card in what was 
probably the world's coldest deck.   He flung off Lord's 
hand and attempted to push past him, inadvertently shoving him into a 
storefront.   It was practically the last move that McBride made 
of his own volition.   Lord slugged him in the stomach, so hard 
that the organ almost pressed against his spine. Then, as he doubled, 
gasping, vomiting the breakfast he had so lately eaten, Lord straightened 
him with an uppercut. A rabbit punch redoubled him. And then 
there was a numbing blow to the heart, and another gut-flattening blow 
to the stomach **h   But he couldn't keep up with them. No 
more could he defend himself against them. He seemed to be fighting 
not one man but a dozen. And he could no longer think of face-saving, 
of honor, but only of escape.   <Why, he's going to kill me,> 
he thought wildly. <I meant him no harm. I've given willful hurt 
to no man. I was just doing my job, just following orders, and for 
that he's going to kill me. Beat me to death in front of a hundred 
people>.   Somehow more terrible than the certainty that he was 
about to die was the knowledge that Lord would probably not suffer for 
it: the murder would go unpunished. He, McBride, would be cited 
as in the wrong, and he, Lord, would go scot-free, an officer who had 
only done his duty, though perhaps too energetically.   McBride 
staggered into the street, flopped sprawling in the stinging dust. 
Fear-maddened, fleeing the lengthening shadow of death, he scrambled 
to his feet again. He couldn't see; he was long past the point of 
coherent thinking. Dimly, he heard laughter, hoots of derision, but 
he could not read the racket properly. He could not grasp that Lord 
had withdrawn from the fight minutes ago, and that his leaden arms were 
flailing at nothing but the air.   He hated them too much to 
understand- the people of this isolated law-unto-itself world that 
was Lord's world. This, he was sure, was the way they <would> 
act; 
laughing at a dying man, laughing as a man was beaten to death. And 
nothing would be done about it. Nothing unless **h   <Donna!> 
Donna, his young wife, the girl who was both daughter and wife 
to him. Donna was like he was. She lived by the rules, never compromising, 
never blinded or diverted by circumstance. And Donna would-

When he regained consciousness he was in Lord's house, in 
the office of Doctor Lord, the deputy's deceased father.

The Brannon outfit- known as the Slash-B because of its brand- 
reached Hondo Creek before sundown. The herd was watered and 
then thrown onto a broad grass flat which was to be the first night's 
bedground. Two of the new hands, a Mexican named Jose Amado and 
a kid known only as Laredo, were picked for the first trick of riding 
night herd.   The rest of the crew offsaddled their mounts and 
turned them into the remuda. They got tin cups of coffee from the big 
pot on the coosie's fire, rolled and lighted brown-paper cigarettes, 
lounged about. There was some idle talk, a listless discussion of 
this or that small happening during the day's drive. But they deliberately 
avoided the one subject that had them all curious: the failure 
of the boss's wife and son to join the outfit. It especially bothered 
the older hands.   The cook, Mateo Garcia, had arrived 
there long before the herd. He'd started a fire and put coffee on, 
and now was busy at the work board of his chuck wagon. He was readying 
a batch of sourdough biscuits for the Dutch oven. Supper would be 
ready within the hour.   The Maguire family was setting up a separate 
camp nearby. Billie had unhitched the mules from both Tom Brannon's 
and his father's wagon. Hank had gathered wood for a cookfire, 
and his wife was busy at it now. Conchita kept an eye on the twins 
and little Elena, trying to keep them from falling into the creek 
by which they persisted in playing. Conchita nagged at the younger children, 
attempting without success to keep her thoughts off Tom Brannon.

Tom Brannon had caught up with the outfit shortly after 
the Maguires joined it, which had been at midday. He'd come alone, 
without his wife and child. He'd been in an angry mood: Conchita 
had thought his face almost ugly with the anger in him.   She 
wondered what had taken place in town, between him and his wife. She 
wished that she could talk to her mother about it. Not that her mother 
knew what had happened, but they could speculate upon it. But her 
mother would rebuke her if she mentioned it, and say that it was none 
of her concern.   "Pat, get out of that creek! You too, Sean! 
Elena, you'll get mud all over your dress"!   Even 
as she called to the children, Conchita let her gaze seek Tom Brannon. 
Tomas, she called him- as the Mexican hands did. He was in earnest 
conversation with her father and the old vaquero, Luis Hernandez. 
Whatever they are talking about? Conchita wondered.   It 
bothered her that she probably would never know. Certainly, she wouldn't 
dare ask her father afterward. He would tell her not to pry into 
grownups' affairs- as though she were a little kid like Elena!

At the moment, the three men were not saying much of anything. 
They were sitting on their heels, rider-fashion, over by the still 
empty calf wagon. Brannon was hunkered down with his broad back to 
the left rear wheel, with the other two facing him. He held a cigarette 
in his right hand. It was burning away, forgotten. His face was 
clouded with unhappiness.   He'd told Hank Maguire and Luis 
Hernandez about his wife's refusal to come with him and about what 
he now intended to do. They were considering it gravely, neither seeming 
to like what he planned.   Finally Hernandez said, "I could 
offer you advice, Tomas, but you wouldn't heed it".   "Let's 
hear it, anyway".   "Wait a little while. Let Senora 
Brannon live in her father's house for a time. Give her time 
to miss you. Maybe she will then come to you. After all, you want the 
senora as much as you want the boy. You need her even more than you 
need him".   "She won't change her mind", Brannon said. 
"John Clayton will see to that".   "But after a time 
away from you **h".   "A year, Luis? Five? Ten? How 
long should I wait"? "Maybe in a year, Tomas **h". 
"In a year she'll like living in Clayton's house too much to 
come back to me", Brannon said flatly. "And the boy will be too 
much under his influence by then. I've got to take Danny away from 
Clayton before I lose him altogether. Hell, in a year or five or ten, 
the boy will have forgotten me- his own father"!   "But 
to take him and leave his mother behind is not good".   "In 
my place, you'd follow such advice as you give me"?   Hernandez 
looked suddenly uncertain. "That I can't answer, for I 
can't imagine something like this happening to me. Maybe I should 
withdraw my advice- no"?   Brannon looked at Hank Maguire. 
"And you? What would you do in my place"?   Hank 
shook his head. "I don't know, Tom. Like Luis, I can't see 
something like this happening to me. With Maria and me, there's never 
any problem. Where I go, she goes- and the kids with us. You're 
going 
to need your woman. And the boy will need his mother. If you take
