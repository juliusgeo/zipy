degree, with any famous monument. Will it live up to its reputation? 
The weight of fame and history is formidable, and dreary steel engravings 
in schoolbooks do little to quicken interest and imagination. Uh 
huh, we think, looking at them, so that's the Parthenon. And then 
perhaps one day we get to Athens. We are here! We've come a 
long way and spent a lot of money. It had better be good. Don't worry 
about the Acropolis. It is awe-inspiring. Probably every visitor 
has a favorite time for his first sight of it. We saw it frequently 
afterward, but our suggestion for the very first encounter is near sunset. 
The light at that time is a benediction. The serene, majestic 
columns of the Parthenon, tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky, 
frame incredible vistas. All we wanted to do was to stand very quietly 
and look and look and look.   More than twenty-four hundred 
years old, bruised, battered, worn and partially destroyed, combining 
to an astounding degree solidity and grace, it still stands, incomparable 
testimony to man's aspiration. In 1687 the Turks, who had been 
in control of the city since the fifteenth century, with a truly shattering 
lack of prudence used the Parthenon as a powder magazine. It 
was hit by a shell fired by the bombarding Venetian army and the great 
central portion of the temple was blown to smithereens.   Nearby 
is the temple of Athena. The architectural feature, the caryatides 
upholding the portico, famous around the world as the Porch of the 
Maidens, was referred to airily by Mando as the Girls' Place. 
Another beautiful building is the Propylaea, the entrance gate of the 
Acropolis.   My other nugget of art and architectural knowledge- 
besides remembering that it was Ghiberti who designed the doors 
of the baptistery in Florence- is the three styles of Greek columns. 
For some happy reason Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian have always 
stuck in my mind. Furthermore I can identify each design. It remained, 
however, for Mando to teach me that Doric symbolized strength, 
Ionic wisdom, and Corinthian beauty, the three pillars of the ancient 
world. The columns of the Parthenon are fluted Doric.   Another 
classic sight that gave us considerable pleasure was the evzone sentry, 
in his ballet skirt with great pompons on his shoes, who was patrolling 
up and down in front of the palace. Gun on shoulder, he would 
march smartly for a few yards, bring his heels together with a click, 
make a brisk pirouette, skirts flaring, and march back to his point 
of departure. We did not dare speak to so exalted a being, but Norton 
aimed his camera and shot him, so to speak, on the rise, the split second 
between the halt and the turn.   The evening of our first 
day we drove with Christopher and Judy Sakellariadis, who were friends 
and patients of Norton, to dine at a restaurant on the shores of 
the Aegean. On the way out Mr& Sakellariadis detoured up a special 
hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the Acropolis lighted 
by night.   The great spectacle was a source of rancor, and 
Son et Lumiere, which the French were trying to promote with the 
Athenians, 
was the reason. These performances were being staged at historical 
monuments throughout Europe. By a combination of music, lighting 
effects, and narration, famous events that have transpired in 
these 
locations are evoked and re-created for large audiences usually to 
considerable acclaim. The Acropolis had been scheduled for the treatment 
too, but apparently it was to take place at the time of the full 
moon when the Athenians themselves, out of respect for the natural beauty 
of the occasion, were wont to forgo their own usual nocturnal illumination.

Athenian society was split into two factions, the Philistines 
and the Artists. The Artists contended that the Philistines, 
gross of soul, were all for having Son et Lumiere, since the 
French were footing the bill and the attraction, wherever it had been 
done, had proven popular. This was the crassest kind of materialism 
and they, the Artists, would have no truck with it. The Acropolis 
was unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flooded by moonlight 
wasn't enough for both natives and tourists, then they were quite 
simply barbarians 
and the hell with them. It was very stimulating.

The restaurant to which the Sakellariadises took us on this night 
of controversy was the Asteria, on Asteria beach. This is a public 
bathing beach, easily accessible by tramway from the center of Athens. 
Office workers frequently go out there to lunch and swim during 
the siesta period, which, during the summer, lasts from two until five 
in the afternoon, when shops and offices are again open for business. 
They close sometime after eight. Nine o'clock is the rush hour, 
when the busses are jammed, and by nine-thirty the restaurants are beginning 
to fill. Bedtime is late, for the balmy evenings are delightful 
and everyone wants to linger under the stars.   The sand is fine 
and pleasant, the cabanas are clean, and the parasols, green, raspberry, 
and butter yellow, are very gay. Although open to the general 
public it is not overcrowded; the atmosphere is that of an attractive 
private beach club at home. We went there a couple of times to swim 
and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. This agreeable state of affairs is 
explicable, I think, on two counts. One is Greece is not yet suffering 
from overpopulation. The public may still find pleasure in public 
places. The other is that the charge for cabanas and parasols, though 
modest from an American point of view, still is a little high for 
many Athenians. We were struck by the notable absence of banana skins 
and beer cans, but just so that we wouldn't go overboard on Greek 
refinement, perfection was side-stepped by a couple of braying portable 
radios. Greek boys and girls also go for rock-and-roll, and the stations 
most tuned to are those carrying United States overseas programs. 
A good deal of English was spoken on the beach, most educated Greeks 
learn it in childhood, and there were also American wives and 
children of our overseas servicemen.   For a delightful drive out 
of Athens I should recommend Sounion, at the end of the Attic Peninsula. 
The road, a comparatively new one, is very good, winding along 
inlets, coves, and bays of deep and brilliant blue. I suppose the 
day will inevitably come when the area will be encrusted with developments, 
but at present it is deserted and seductive. Three beneficial 
hurdles to progress are the lack of water, electricity, and telephones.

At Sounion there is a group of beautiful columns, the ruins 
of a temple to Poseidon, of particular interest at that time, as active 
reconstruction was in progress. Gaunt scaffoldings adjoined the ruins, 
and on the ground segments of columns two and a half to three feet 
in thickness were being fitted with sections cunningly chiseled to 
match exactly the fluting and proportion of the original. Later they 
would be hoisted into place.   There is a mediocre restaurant at 
Sounion and I fed a thin little Grecian cat and gave it two saucers 
of water- there was no milk- which it lapped up as though it were 
nectar. I think its thirst had never been assuaged before.   Norton 
and I dined one night in a sea-food restaurant in Piraeus right 
on the water's edge. To enter it, you go down five or six steps 
from the road. Across the road is the kitchen, and waiters bearing great 
trays of dishes dodge traffic as nimbly as their French colleagues 
at the restaurant in the Place du Tertre in Paris.   This restaurant, 
too, had a cat, a dusty, thin little creature. How <can> 
a cat be thin in a fish restaurant? But this one was. When offered 
a morsel it glanced right and left and winced, obviously frightened 
and expecting a kick, but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit. Greece 
was one of the highlights of our trip, but beginning in Greece and continuing 
around the world throughout Southeast Asia the treatment of 
animals was horrifying, ranging from callous indifference to active 
cruelty. This of course was not true of the educated and sophisticated 
people we met, who loved their pets, but kindness is not a basic human 
instinct.   We met some charming Athenians, and among them our 
chauffeur Panyotis ranked high. His English was limited, and the 
little he knew he found irritating. A particularly galling phrase was 
"O&K&, Panyotis, we have time at our disposal". This he 
claimed was the favorite refrain of the English. They would be lolling 
under a tree sipping Ouzo, relishing the leisurely life, assuring 
him that the day was yet young. 
"Let him become honest, and they discard him.- But let him be ready 
to invent whatever falsehood- to assail whatever character- and 
to prostitute his paper to whatever ends- and they hug him to their 
heart. In proportion to the degradation of his moral worth, is the 
increase of his worth to them".   To exonerate the legislature 
and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation, Pike took another 
course and made it appear that the legislature had been bilked. He 
claimed in his attacks that Woodruff, with scurrilous underhandedness, 
had deliberately written an ambiguous bid that had so confused the 
honest members of the legislature that they had awarded him the contract 
without knowing what they were doing.   The charge was so farfetched 
that Woodruff paid little attention to it, and answered Pike 
in a rather bored way, wearily declaring that a "new hand" was 
pumping the bellows of the Crittenden organ, and concluding: "In 
a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principles, 
even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurels. The game 
is not worth the ammunition it would cost. We therefore leave the writer 
to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse 
he has heaped on us will entitle him to from the low and vulgar herd 
to which he belongs".   Despite Woodruff's continuing refusal 
to debate with Pike through the columns of his newspaper, Pike 
did not let up his attack for a moment. Over the months he became a 
political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poems ridiculing 
Woodruff, the "Casca" letters belittling Woodruff, and long 
analytical articles vilifying Woodruff. So persistent were these attacks 
that in March of the following year, Woodruff was finally moved 
to action, and Pike was to learn his first lesson in frontier politics, 
the subtle art of diversion.   To attack Pike directly would 
gain Woodruff little, for as a penniless newcomer Pike had nothing 
to lose. By this time Woodruff had accurately measured Pike as a 
man of great personal pride, a man who would fly into a towering rage 
if his integrity were questioned, and who would be anxious to avenge himself. 
Pike's honor would now come under attack, but not by Woodruff 
himself. The charges would be made in the <Gazette> by an anonymous 
correspondent, and Pike would be so busy trying to track down the 
illusive character assassin that he would forget about harassing Woodruff. 
The strategy worked perfectly.   Pike was stunned by the 
first blast against his character, which was published in the March 
4th issue of the <Gazette> under the name "Vale". The anonymous 
correspondent did not resort to innuendoes. He called Pike a thief. 
He said Pike had stolen mules from Harris during the Santa Fe 
expedition; he accused Pike of continuing his sticky-fingered career 
in Arkansas with the theft of some otter skins in Van Buren. The 
charges caught Pike off balance, coming as they did from an unexpected 
quarter. Outraged, he used the <Advocate> of March 7th for a 
denial, sending immediately to Santa Fe and Van Buren for documents 
to vindicate himself, and demanding that Woodruff reveal the name 
of this perfidious slanderer who disguised himself under a pastoral pseudonym.

Woodruff said nothing, and Pike, frustrated, stormed 
throughout Little Rock in an unsuccessful search for "Vale", 
asking 
his friends to keep their ears open. Finally he learned through 
the grapevine that the culprit might be one James W& Robinson in 
Pope County. Without further inquiry, Pike jumped to the conclusion 
that Robinson was guilty, and, following the honorable route that 
would 
eventually lead to the dueling ground, sent a message to Robinson 
through his friends, demanding that he either confirm or deny his complicity. 
Robinson did neither. To Pike, silence was tantamount to an 
admission of guilt, and he determined to get Robinson onto the dueling 
ground at all costs. On April 11th he wrote an open letter in the 
<Advocate>, making it known "to the world that Jas& W& Robinson 
<is by his own admission> a base LIAR and a SLANDERER".

If Robinson was a liar and a slanderer, he was also 
a very canny gentleman, for nothing that Pike could do would pry so
