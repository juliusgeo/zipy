in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill 
and education of the practitioner", says Dr& Brodie.   To 
become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed by his state as 
a dentist, then he must spend at least two years in additional training 
to acquire a license as a specialist.   "Costs may seem high, 
but they used to be even higher", says Dr& Brodie. "Fees 
are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago".   The 
reason? People today are aware of the value of orthodontics, and 
as a result there are more practitioners in the field.   Most 
orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic 
materials and construction of the appliances, but usually the remainder 
of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years. In many 
cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools 
will take patients at a nominal fee. Some municipal agencies will 
pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents. 

#RESEARCH 
HELPS FAMILIES#

GROWTH studies have been carried on consistently 
by orthodontists. Dr& Brodie has 30-year records of head growth, 
started 20 minutes after children's births.   "In the 
past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was 
scoffed at; now we know that family characteristics <do> affect tooth 
formation to a large extent", he says. "Fortunately through our 
growth studies we have been able to see what nature does, and that 
helps us know what we can do".   This knowledge both modifies 
and dictates diagnosis and treatment. For example, a boy may inherit 
a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another. In the past 
an orthodontist might have tried, over four or five years, to straighten 
and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth, 
would never accommodate them. Now a dentist can recommend extraction 
immediately.   In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge 
of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five 
years before treatment. The child is kept on call, and the orthodontist 
watches the growth. "Nature often takes care of the problem", 
says Dr& Brodie. "A child with a certain type of head and teeth 
will outgrow tooth deformity".   That is why Dr& Brodie 
asks parents not to insist, against their dentist's advice, that their 
child have orthodontic work done too early. "Both because of our 
culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions, 
some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it 
is wise to do so. Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start 
treatment", he urges.   Superior new material for orthodontic 
work is another result of research. Plastics are easier to handle 
than the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save time and money. 
Plaster of Paris, once utilized in making impressions of teeth, has 
been replaced by alginates (gelatin-like material) that work quickly 
and accurately and with least discomfort to a child. 

#PREVENTION IS 
BEST#

AS a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is started, 
the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.

"After your child's baby teeth are all in- usually at the age 
of two and one half to three- it's time for that first dental appointment", 
Dr& Brodie advises. "Then see that your youngster 
has a routine checkup once a year".   To help prevent orthodontic 
problems from arising, your dentist can do these things: _@_ 
He can correct decay, thus preventing early loss of teeth. If 
a child <does> lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay- 
and if no preventive steps are taken- the other teeth may shift out 
of position, become overcrowded and malformed. In turn the other teeth 
are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them. 
From time to time the medium mentions other people "around him", 
who were "on the other side", and reports what they are saying. After 
a while there come initials and names, and he is interested to hear 
some rather unusual family nicknames. As the hour progresses, the 
sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific 
statements. There are a few prognoses of coming events. ## 

ANOTHER MEDIUM, another sitter, would produce a somewhat different 
content, but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing 
reading. Some mediums speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while 
others may stress the spiritual. Not all, as a matter of fact, consider 
themselves "mediums" in the sense of receiving messages from 
the deceased. In fact, some sensitives rule this out, preferring to 
consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception 
(~ESP), 
on this side of the "veil". However that may be, people are 
known to go to mediums for diverse reasons. Perhaps they are mourning 
a recent death and want comfort, to feel in touch with the deceased, 
or seek indications for future plans. They may, of course, be curiosity 
seekers- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.

The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation 
is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated 
state, so that the sitter can make comments, ask and answer questions, 
instead of talking with a "control" who speaks through an 
entranced sensitive. What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary 
conversation.   But it is not really only a conversation. 
Many a sitter (in a personal sitting) has been amazed to realize that 
the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind. He himself 
might not have been really aware of his own mood; it had been latent, 
unspecified, semi-conscious and only partly realized- until she 
described it to him! Most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability 
to put a finger on "pre-conscious" moods and to clarify them.

However, in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium, 
he did not receive a personal reading. Instead he brought with 
him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium 
knew nothing. For this was to be a "proxy sitting". ##

AS 
WAS NOTED earlier, it is important that in valid, objective study of 
this sort of communication, the interested sitter should be separated 
from the sensitive. Dr& Karlis Osis, Director of Research at 
the Parapsychology Foundation, described the basis for the experiment 
in a TOMORROW article, ("New Research on Survival After 
Death", Spring 1958). He remarked: "It has been clearly established 
that in a number of instances the message did not come from a 
spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter".

The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's ~ESP 
may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this, the two central 
characters in this drama must be separated.   One way to do 
this is by "proxy sittings", wherein the person seeking a message 
does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute, 
the proxy sitter. If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter 
except his name (given by the experimenter), he cannot possibly 
give any clues, conscious or unconscious, far less ask leading questions. 
All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner, seeking 
to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal 
impressions.   Sometimes in these experiments "appointment 
sittings" are used. Here the absent sitter makes a "date" 
with a communicator (someone close to him who is deceased), asking him 
to "come in" at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for 
him. In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator, 
nothing else. He gives this to the medium at the appointed 
time, and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages 
from the communicator. As always, a tape recording or detailed 
notes are made, and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.

So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier 
between the medium's ~ESP and the absent sitter's mind. It 
is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements- though 
research still does not know how far afield ~ESP <can> range. 
##

NOW THE ORIGINAL absent sitter must decide whether the 
statements are meaningful to <him>. Here again laboratory approaches 
are being evolved, for it is recognized how "elastic" these readings 
can be, how they can apply to many people, and are often stated 
in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case. 
If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you will probably 
see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you, 
even when you were not in the picture at all! An interested sitter 
may think the sensitive has made a "hit", describing something accurately 
for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter, hearing 
the same statement, would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances? 
It is, of course, easy to see how "~J" will mean 
Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another. "A journey", 
"a 
little white house", "a change of outlook", can apply to many 
people. And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform 
to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal. One sitter 
may think "a leather couch" identifies a reading as surely directed 
to him; to another, it seems that nobody but his father ever 
used the phrase, "Atta boy"!   To get around this quite difficult 
corner, there is one first aid to objectiveness: prevent the 
distant sitter from knowing which reading <was> for him. If he is 
not told which of four or five readings was meant for him, he can more 
readily assess each item in a larger frame: "Does that statement 
really sound as if it were for me, significant in my particular life? 
Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody, 
and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar 
experience"?   Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive 
such statements as the following, which, if they turned out 
to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant:   "He 
had four children, two sets of twins. After being a lawyer for twenty-five 
years he started studying for the ministry. Part of his house 
had been moved to the other side of the road. He died of typhoid in 
1921".   Methods have been developed of assigning "weights" 
to statements; that is, it is known empirically that names beginning 
with ~R are more common than those beginning with ~Z; that 
fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth; that in the United 
States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox. So each reading 
can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these 
weights. Specific dates would be important, as would double names. 
Various categories have been explored to find out about these "empirical 
probabilities" against which to measure the readings. ##

IN 
THE PARAPSYCHOLOGY FOUNDATION'S long-range experiment, readings 
are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating 
sitters, trying to throw light on this question of the significance 
of mediumistic statements. It is very important indeed, in the field 
of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis, 
to know whether the statements are actually only those which any 
intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself. 
Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated, facts which are 
in themselves significant and <not> easily applicable to everybody? 
That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.

So, after the sitting has been held, several readings at one time 
are mailed, and the distant sitter (whose name or whose communicator's 
name was given to the medium) must mark each little item as Correct 
(Hit), Incorrect (Miss), Doubtful, or Especially Significant (applying
