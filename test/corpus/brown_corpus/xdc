to restock his tangled acres with pheasants, he poaches only what 
he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers. One 
of the local callers, a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's 
tales of India, does not approve of the way Larkin gets 
his birds.   He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair 
on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance 
is entirely sporting. But the brigadier dines on the birds with 
relish.

IT is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive 
film yet made from Miguel de Cervantes' "Don Quixote" 
is the brilliant Russian spectacle, done in wide screen and color, 
which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street 
Playhouses.   More than a beautiful visualization of the 
illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant 
and his squire, Sancho Panza, in seventeenth-century Spain, this inevitably 
abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an 
affectingly warm and human exposition of character. #@#

Nikolai 
Cherkasov, the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander 
Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible, performs the lanky Don Quixote, 
and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility 
and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.   His addle-brained 
knight-errant, self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an 
age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous 
code of knight-errantry had become a joke, is, as Cervantes no doubt 
intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely 
in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.   Cherkasov 
does not caricature him, as some actors have been inclined to do. He 
treats this deep-eyed, bearded, bony crackpot with tangible affection 
and respect. Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is 
studiously 
slow, he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and 
passing gravely through an impious world.   The complexities 
of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately 
stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in 
place of the Russian dialogue. The voices of all the characters, including 
that of Cherkasov, have richness, roughness or color to conform 
with the personalities. And the subtleties of the dialogue are most 
helpfully conveyed. Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish, 
there is no violation of artistry or logic here.   Splendid, 
too, is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev, one of Russia's leading 
comedians, as Sancho Panza, the fat, grotesque "squire". Though 
his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don, 
he gives it a firmness and toughness- a sort of peasant dignity- 
too. It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character 
the 
oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons.

The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played 
on him when he is facetiously put in command of an "island" is 
one of the best in the film. #@#

True, the pattern and flow of 
the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in 
the first half, before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court. But 
strength and poignancy develop thenceforth, and the windmill and deathbed 
episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of 
the old boy.   There are other good representations of peasants 
and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently 
photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this 
country in the program of joint cultural exchange.   Also on the 
bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called 
"Sunday in Greenwich Village", a tour of the haunts and joints.

Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz, 
which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member 
of the family.   There seems to be an unfortunate assumption 
that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time, for example, 
could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary. 
At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for "Chicago 
and All That Jazz", presented on ~NBC-~TV Nov& 
26.   The program came out of the ~NBC Special Projects department, 
and was slotted in the Du Pont Show of the Week series. 
Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines. 
If so, it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different 
department- one with enough confidence in the musical material 
to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room 
to display their talents.   As a matter of fact, this latter approach 
has already been tried, and with pleasing results. A few years 
ago a 
"Timex All-Star Jazz Show" offered a broad range of styles, 
ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling 
Dukes of Dixieland. An enthusiastic audience confirmed the "live" 
character of the hour, and provided the interaction between musician 
and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance.

About that same time John Crosby's ~TV series 
on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space 
is one of the most sensible things a producer can do. In an hour remembered 
for its almost rudderless movement, a score of jazz luminaries 
went before the cameras for lengthy periods. The program had been arranged 
to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration 
on the music. Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups, 
then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work.

"Chicago and All That Jazz" could not be faulted on the choice 
of artists. Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden, 
Gene Krupa, Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, Johnny St& Cyr, 
Joe Sullivan, Red Allen, Lil Armstrong, Blossom Seeley. The 
jazz buff could hardly ask for more.   Furthermore, Garry Moore 
makes an ideal master of ceremonies. (He played host at the Timex 
show already mentioned.)   One of the script's big problems 
was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances 
by musicians of today. ~NBC had gathered a lot of historical material 
which it was eager to share. For example, there was sheet music 
with the word "jazz" in the title, 
to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold. Samples 
soomed into closeup range in regular succession, like telephone poles 
passing on the highway, while representative music reinforced the mood 
of the late teens and 1920's.   However well chosen and cleverly 
arranged, such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an 
interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business, which 
(considering the talent at hand) should probably have been the gathering 
of fresh samples of the Chicago style.   Another source of 
~NBC pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke, but this 
view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would 
have blotted out the entire glimpse. Similarly, in presenting still 
photographs of early jazz groups, the program allowed no time for a 
close perusal.   "Chicago and All That Jazz" may have wound 
up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer. 
By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase 
for today's artists, the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect 
example of either. Still, the network's willingness to experiment 
in this musical field is to be commended, and future essays happily 
anticipated.

Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous 
reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending 
her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor" Sunday 
night.   The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of 
cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland 
took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic "Mad 
Scene" created on her own and with the help of the composer and the 
other performers.   Her entrance in Scene 2, Act 1, brought some 
disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note. Thereafter 
the audience waxed applause-happy, but discriminating operagoers reserved 
judgment as her singing showed signs of strain, her musicianship 
some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization. 
As she gained composure during the second act, her technical resourcefulness 
emerged stronger, though she had already revealed a trill almost 
unprecedented in years of performances of "Lucia". She topped 
the sextet brilliantly.   Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy 
so that it stopped the show midway in the "Mad Scene", but the 
real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding 
at the moment. Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person 
in this scene: A much more girlish Lucia, a sensational coloratura 
who ran across stage while singing, and an actress immersed in her 
role. What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as 
Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among 
sopranos today.   This big, flexible voice with uncommon range 
has been superbly disciplined. Nervousness at the start must have caused 
the blemishes of her first scene, or she may warm up slowly. In 
the fullness of her vocal splendor, however, she could sing the famous 
scene magnificently.   Technically it was fascinating, aurally 
spell-binding, and dramatically quite realistic. Many years have passed 
since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable. Her debut 
over, perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine.   The 
performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor, 
Silvio Varviso. He injected more vitality into the score than 
it has revealed in many years. He may respect too much the Italian tradition 
of letting singers hold on to their notes, but to restrain them 
in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.   Richard Tucker 
sang Edgardo in glorious voice. His bel canto style gave the performance 
a special distinction. The remainder of the cast fulfilled its 
assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and 
limited stage direction proved only serviceable.   Miss Sutherland 
first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959. (The first Metropolitan 
Opera broadcast on Dec& 9 will introduce her as Lucia.) 
She 
has since turned to Bellini, whose opera "Beatrice di Tenda" 
in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her 
to New York last season. She will sing "La Sonambula" with 
it here next week.

Anyone for musical Ping-pong?   It's really quite fun- 
as long as you like games. You will need a stereo music system, 
with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart, and 
one or more of the new London "Phase 4" records. There are 12 
of these to choose from, all of them of popular music except for the 
star release, {Pass in Review} (~SP-44001). This features 
the marching songs of several nations, recorded as though the various 
national bands were marching by your reviewing stand. Complete with 
crowd effects, interruptions by jet planes, and sundry other touches of 
realism, this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect.

All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed 
explanation of this new recording program. No reference is made to the 
possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner, and 
it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music. Directionality 
is greatly exaggerated most of the time; but when the sounds of 
the two speakers are allowed to mix, there is excellent depth and dimension 
to the music. You definitely hear some of the instruments close 
up and others farther back, with the difference in placement apparently 
more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely 
being louder than the ones farther back. This is a characteristic of 
good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural 
sound.   London explains that the very distinct directional 
effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods
