populated State. The provisions are also designed to avoid disruption 
in State programs already in operation, which might otherwise result 
from the allotment of funds on the basis of wealth and population 
alone. _METHOD OF COMPUTING ALLOTMENTS._ The method used in computing 
the allotments is specifically set forth in the Act. The term 
"State" means the several States, the District of Columbia, the 
Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico; the term "United States" 
includes the several States and the District of Columbia, and 
excludes the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico, and, prior 
to 
1962, Alaska and Hawaii. The following steps are employed in calculations: 
_1._ For each State (except Puerto Rico, Guam, the 
Virgin Islands, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii) determine 
average per capita income based on the last three years. (See <Source 
of Data>, below for per capita income data to be used in this step.) 
_2._ Determine the average per capita income for the U& S& 
based on the last three years. (See <Source of Data>, below, 
for per capita income data to be used in this step.) _3._ Determine 
the ratio of 50% to the average per capita income of the U& S& 
(Divide 50 by the result obtained in item 2 above.) _4._ Determine 
for each State (except the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto 
Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii) that percentage which 
bears the same ratio to 50% as the particular State's average per 
capita income bears to the average per capita income of the U& S&. 
(Multiply the result obtained in item 3 above by the result obtained 
for each State in item 1 above.) _5._ Determine the particular 
State's "allotment percentage". By law this is 75% for 
the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico. (Alaska and Hawaii had 
fixed allotment percentages in effect prior to fiscal year 1962.)

In all other States it is the difference obtained by subtracting 
from 100 the result obtained in item 4 above; <except> that no 
State shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-1/3% nor more 
than 75%. If the resulting difference for the particular State is 
less or more than these extremes, the State's allotment percentage 
must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme. _6._ Square 
each State's allotment percentage. _7._ Determine each State's 
population. (See <Source of Data>, below for population data 
to be used in this step.) _8._ Multiply the population of each 
State by the square of its allotment percentage. (Multiply result obtained 
in item 7 above, by result obtained in item 6 above.) _9._ 
Determine the sum of the products obtained in item 8 above, for all the 
States. (For each State, make all computations set forth in items 
1 to 8 above, and then add the results obtained for each State in item 
8.) _10._ Determine the ratio that the amount being allotted 
is to the sum of the products for all the States. (Divide the amount 
being allotted by the result obtained in item 9 above.) _11._ Determine 
the particular State's unadjusted allotment for the particular 
fiscal year. (Multiply the State product in item 8 above by the 
result obtained in item 10 above.) _12._ Determine if the particular 
State's unadjusted allotment (result obtained in item 11 above) 
is greater than its maximum allotment, and if so lower its unadjusted 
allotment to its maximum allotment. (Each State's unadjusted allotment 
for any fiscal year, which exceeds its minimum allotment described 
in item 13 below by a percentage greater than one and one-half times 
the percentage by which the sum being allotted exceeds $23,000,000, 
must be reduced by the amount of the excess.) _13._ Determine if 
the particular State's unadjusted allotment (result obtained in item 
11 above) is less than its minimum (base) allotment, and if so raise 
its unadjusted 
allotment to its minimum allotment. Regardless of its unadjusted 
allotment, each State is guaranteed by law a minimum allotment 
each year equal to the allotment which it received in fiscal year 1954- 
increased by a uniform percentage of 5.4865771 which brings total 
1954 allotments to all States up to $23,000,000. _14._ The funds 
recouped by reductions in item 12 above are used: first, to increase 
the unadjusted allotments to the specified minimum in those States 
where the unadjusted allotment is less than the minimum allotment (item 
13 above); and second, to increase uniformly the allotments to those 
States whose allotments are below their maximums, with adjustments 
to prevent the allotment of any State from thereby exceeding its maximum. 
_ADDITIONAL NOTE ON ALLOTMENTS._ For the States which maintain 
two separate agencies- one for the vocational rehabilitation of 
the blind, and one for the rehabilitation of persons other than the 
blind- the Act specifies that their minimum (base) allotment shall 
be divided between the two agencies in the same proportion as it was divided 
in fiscal year 1954. Funds allotted in addition to their minimum 
allotment are apportioned to the two agencies as they may determine. 

#MATCHING REQUIREMENTS#

_EXPLANATION OF MATCHING FORMULA._ As 
is the case with the allotment provisions for support of vocational 
rehabilitation services, the matching requirements are also based on 
a statutory formula. Prior to 1960, in order to provide matching for 
the minimum (base) allotment, State funds had to equal 1954 State funds. 
Prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment is matched 
at rates related to the fiscal capacity of the State, with a pivot 
of 40% State (or 60% Federal) participation in total program 
costs. The percentage of Federal participation in such costs for any 
State is referred to in the law as that State's "Federal share". 
For purposes of this explanation, this percentage is referred to 
as the States "unadjusted Federal share". Beginning in 1960, the 
matching requirements for the base allotment are being adjusted (upward 
or downward, as required) 25% a year, so that by 1963 the entire 
support allotment will be matched on the basis of a 40% pivot State 
share, with maximum and minimum State shares of 50% and 30%, respectively. 
The pre-1960 rate of Federal participation with respect 
to any State's base allotment, as well as the adjusted rate in effect 
during the 1960-1962 period, is designated by the statute as that 
State's "adjusted Federal Share". The provisions for determining 
a State's unadjusted Federal share are designed to reflect the 
varying financial resources among the States. The purpose of the adjusted 
Federal share relating to the base allotment and of the transition 
provisions 
for reaching the unadjusted Federal share is to prevent 
dislocations from abrupt changes in matching rates. _METHOD OF COMPUTING 
FEDERAL SHARES._ The method used for computing the respective 
Federal and State shares in total program costs is specifically set 
forth in the Act. The term "State" means the several States, 
the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico; 
the term "United States" includes the several States and 
the District of Columbia and excludes the Virgin Islands, Guam 
and Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and Hawaii. The following 
steps are employed in the calculations: _1._ For each State 
(except the Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, 
Alaska and Hawaii), determine the average per capita income for 
the last three years. (the same amount used in item 1 under <Method 
of Computing allotments>, above.) _2._ Determine the average 
per capita income for the United States for the last three years. (The 
same amount used in item 2 under <Method of Computing Allotments>, 
above.) _3._ Determine the ratio of 40% to the average per 
capita income of the United States. (Divide 40 by the amount used 
in item 2 above.) _4._ Determine for each State (except the Virgin 
Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and, prior to 1962, Alaska and hawaii), 
that percentage which bears the same ration to 40% as the particular 
State's average per capita income bears to the average per 
capita income of the United States. (Multiply the result obtained 
in item 3 above by the amount used for each State in item 1 above.) _5._ 
Determine the particular State's "Federal Share". By 
law this is 70% for the Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico. 
(Alaska and Hawaii had fixed Federal share percentages in effect prior 
to fiscal year 1962.)   In all other States it is the difference 
obtained by subtracting from 100 the result obtained in item 4 
above; <except> 
that no State shall have a Federal share less than 
50% nor more than 70%. If the resulting difference for the particular 
State is less or more than these extremes, the State's Federal 
share must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme.

At the entrance side of the shelter, each roof beam is rested 
on the inside 4 inches of the block wall. The outside 4-inch space is 
filled by mortaring blocks on edge. The wooden bracing between the roof 
beams is placed flush with the inside of the wall. Mortar is poured 
between this bracing and the 4-inch blocks on edge to complete the 
wall thickness for radiation shielding. (For details see inset, fig& 
5.)   The first one or two roof boards (marked "~E" in 
fig& 6) are slipped into place across the roof beams, from outside 
the shelter. These boards are nailed to the roof beams by reaching up 
through the open space between the beams, from inside the shelter. Concrete 
blocks are passed between the beams and put on the boards. The 
roof blocks are in two layers and are not mortared together. 
Work on the roof continues in this way. The last roof boards are covered 
with blocks from outside the shelter.   When the roof blocks 
are all in place, the final rows of wall blocks are mortared into position. 
The structure is complete. (See fig& 7.) Building plans are 
on page 21.   Solid concrete blocks, relatively heavy and dense, 
are used for this shelter. These blocks are sold in various sizes 
so it seldom is necessary to cut a block to fit.   Solid blocks 
are recommended because hollow blocks would have to be filled with concrete 
to give effective protection.   Bricks are an alternative. 
If they are used, the walls and roof should be 10 inches thick to give 
the same protection as the 8-inch solid concrete blocks.   The 
illustrations in fig& 8 show how to lay a concrete block wall. More 
detailed instructions may be obtained from your local building supply 
houses and craftsmen. Other sources of information include the National 
Concrete Masonry Association, 38 South Dearborn Street, 
Chicago, Ill&, the Portland Cement Association, 33 West Grand 
Avenue, Chicago, Ill&, and the Structural Clay Products Association, 
Washington, D&C&. _ABOVEGROUND DOUBLE-WALL SHELTER_ 
An outdoor, aboveground fallout shelter also may be built with concrete 
blocks. (See fig& 9, double-wall shelter.) Most people would 
have to hire a contractor to build this shelter. Plans are on pages 
22 and 23.   This shelter could be built in regions where water 
or rock is close to the surface, making it impractical to build an underground 
shelter.   Two walls of concrete blocks are constructed 
at least 20 inches apart. The space between them is filled with pit-run 
gravel or earth. The walls are held together with metal ties placed 
in the wet mortar as the walls are built.   The roof shown here 
(fig& 9) is a 6-inch slab of reinforced concrete, covered with at 
least 20 inches of pit-run gravel. An alternate roof, perhaps more 
within do-it-yourself reach, could be constructed of heavy wooden roof 
beams, overlaid with boards and waterproofing. It would have to be covered 
with at least 28 inches of pit-run gravel.   The materials 
for a double-wall shelter would cost about $700. Contractors' charges 
would be additional. The shelter would provide almost absolute fallout 
protection. _PRE-SHAPED METAL SHELTER_ Pre-shaped corrugated 
metal sections or pre-cast concrete can be used for shelters either 
above or below ground. These are particularly suitable for regions where 
water or rock is close to the surface. They form effective fallout 
shelters when mounded over with earth, as shown in figure 10. 
Materials for this shelter would cost about $700. A contractor probably 
would be required to help build it. His charges would be added to 
the cost of materials. This shelter, as shown on page 24, would provide 
almost absolute protection from fallout radiation. An alternate 
hatchway entrance, shown on page 25, would reduce the cost of materials 
$50 to $100.   The National Lumber Manufacturers Association, 
Washington, D& C&, is developing plans to utilize specially 
treated lumber for underground shelter construction. The Structural 
Clay Products Institute, Washington, D&C&, is working to develop
