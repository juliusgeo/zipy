Liberals were doing to promote "Louis Capet" ["The Week", 
June 3], another analogy had occurred to me.   Consider 
this table: _1._ Louis /14,- ~FDR. "**h With no strong 
men and no parliament to dispute his will, he <was> the government". 

_2._ Regency- Truman. "A 'dust-settling' period 
of decadence and decline". _3._ Louis /15,- Eisenhower. 
"**h he opened his mouth, said little, and thought not at all". _4._ 
Louis /16,- Kennedy. "**h not <completely> virtuous, 
but <completely> incompetent".   And Marie Antoinette- Jacqueline 
Bouvier. "**h the beautiful and light-hearted". _5._ 
French Revolution- Conservative Revolution?   Truly, 
that Liberals should choose Louis /14, as a bogey-symbol of conservatism 
is grotesquely ironic, considering the Louis /14, character 
of their Grand Monarque, ~FDR: not only in his accretion of absolute 
power and personal deification, (<le roi gouverne par lui meme>), 
but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.

In defeating "Louis Capet", John Tower's victory in 
Texas signals, once again, the end of the divine right of Liberalism. 

#CONFRONTATION#

IT SEEMS TO ME that N&C&, in his editorial 
"Confrontation" [~SR, Mar& 25], has hit upon the real 
problem that bothers all of us in a complex world: how do we retain 
our personal relationship with those who suffer? This affects us 
all intimately, and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress. 
I know of no other solution than the one N&C& proposes- 
to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us, hoping that 
this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place. Never 
have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically. @

THANK YOU for the illustrated editorial "Confrontation". 
It is both great writing and profound religion. @   N&C& 
HAS SAID something important so well that this preacher 
will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece. @   I 
FEEL THAT N&C& hit the very core of our existence in the editorial 
"Confrontation". Personally, it meant a great deal; my 
only hope is that it will be shared by many, many others. @   "CONFRONTATION" 
should fortify us all, whether in Southeast 
Asia or the U&S&. @   CONGRATULATIONS TO N&C& 
for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the 
Peace Corps. I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have 
a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands. It would 
be heartbreaking to see idealism, and hence effective leadership, thwarted 
by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into. 
@   THE EDITORIAL "Confrontation" was certainly direct 
in its appear to those of us living here in America. I personally 
gained strength from it. Thanks for continuing to capture the attention 
and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world. @

N&C&'s EDITORIAL "Confrontation" is a stunning piece 
of writing. I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone 
entering the Peace Corps to read it. The important people to 
humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros **h but the Schweitzers 
and the Dooleys, and the others like them whose names we will 
never know. @   EDITOR'S NOTE: <Reprints of "Confrontation" 
will be included among the material to be distributed to 
members of the Peace Corps. A Peace Corps official described the 
editorial as "precisely the message we need to communicate to the 
men and women who will soon be Peace Corps volunteers>". 

#IMPROPER 
BOSTONIAN?#

F& L& LUCAS'S article in ~SR's 
April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the 
New English Bible. I certainly hope this will be the impression left 
in the minds of readers, rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory 
in his FIRST OF THE MONTH column. It is blind, fundamentalist 
dogmatism to say, "Messing around with the King James version 
**h seems to us a perilous sport at best". @ 

#FACTS IN FOCUS# 

LESTER MARKEL is on the right track in his article "Interpretation 
of Interpretation" 
[~SR, Mar& 11]. The current stereotype 
of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting 
the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored 
fact, fancy, and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished 
in this country more than a generation ago.   We don't 
need this type of protection any more. The public is now armed with 
sophistication and numerous competing media. Besides, there are no 
longer enough corruptible journalists about.   The accepted method 
of writing news has two major liabilities. First, it does not communicate. 
A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements 
of both sides in a major labor dispute, for instance, is unable to tell 
his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute. 
Second, it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous. The 
charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed 
innocent people but misled the nation. Yet the press was powerless 
to put these charges in perspective in its news columns. despite several 
years of front-page stories, the average citizen was unable to get 
a complete picture of McCarthy until he saw on the television screen 
what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way 
of communicating. The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.

It seems to me the time has come for the American 
press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will 
do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by 
those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve 
their own ends. The objective should be to provide a method of getting 
into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant 
information in the possession of reporters and editors. @ 

#SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BLACKOUT#

I WOULD LIKE to see you devote 
some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President 
Kennedy's activities, so far as Southern California is concerned. 
You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised 
press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent 
opinions.   To begin with, the all-powerful Los Angeles <Times> 
does not publish a transcript of these press conferences. I 
am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.   Next, 
because of the time differential, the conferences come on the networks 
during the middle of the day. Up until now, the networks have grudgingly 
run half-hour tapes at 5 P&M& or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P&M&. 
Even then, a few of the "less interesting" questions are 
edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator. However, last night 
the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got 
on ~TV were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley 
and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs. This is no criticism 
of them, as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute 
news summary.   The radio stations did run "transcripts" 
(I thought) during the evening hours. However, by comparing 
the ~TV snatches, two different radio station re-runs, and the censored 
Los Angeles <Times> version, I found that the radio stations 
had edited out questions (~ABC removed the one regarding Laos) 
or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer. 
I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country 
about the "abuse" he is being subjected to. We out here don't 
see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.   I don't 
know if this is the situation in other parts of the country; apparently 
it is not. It also happened with the Inauguration, which was 
not re-run at all during the evening hours, and I wrote to the ~TV 
editor of the <Times>. He did mention in his column the fact that 
he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand 
the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this- 
but nothing happened.   Can you bring the networks' attention 
to this? @ 

#FOR A COLLEGE OF PROPAGANDA#

I WAS INTERESTED 
in James Webb Young's MADISON AVENUE column in which 
he raised the question "Do We Need a College of Propaganda"? 
[~SR, Feb& 11].   In my estimation, we definitely 
do; and the sad part of it is that we had one, which was rounding into 
excellent shape, and we let it disintegrate and die.   During 
the war, we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare, 
which included the teaching of propaganda, both black and white and the 
various shades of grey in between. We had a couple of schools in this 
country, the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out 
in Lloyd's Neck. There were also a couple in Canada, and several 
in England. The English schools preceded ours, and by the time we 
got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda 
and its teaching.   Four of us here in the United States attended, 
first as students, then as instructors, almost every one of these 
schools, in England, Canada, and the United States. We set up 
the Lloyd's Neck school, worked out its curriculum, and taught there. 
Toward the end of the war, we really felt that we had learned something 
about propaganda and how to teach it.   When the end did 
come, and the schools were disbanded and abandoned, we felt and hoped 
that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust. 
We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some 
sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year 
or so. Alas, no such thing happened. There apparently is no school of 
propaganda or psychological warfare. A study at the Pentagon and at 
the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there. And 
not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been 
called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way. @   CONGRATULATIONS 
on the article "Do We Need a College of Propaganda"? 
This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this 
critical field in years, and I certainly hope it sparks some action.

#LET THE MEDIA CLEAN HOUSE, TOO#

MANY OF US in public 
relations were flattered that Richard L& Tobin chose to devote his 
editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger 
of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public 
Relations Association. 

#SNOW STORM#

I WAS SURPRISED and sorry to find in your issue 
of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet 
been published.   Whether in his forthcoming book C& P& Snow 
commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily 
autobiographical critic charged him is important. One should be able 
to get hold of the book at once. But the attack was made from an advance 
copy. If this practice should take root and spread, the man who 
submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before 
he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality.
