because of their importance in understanding the current activities 
of the Planning Division. _(1)_ First priority will be given to 
the preparation of a meaningful state guide plan to serve as a background 
for all other planning activities in the state. _(2)_ Recognizing 
the truth of the statement by the Institute of Public Administration 
that "Metropolian Planning (in Rhode Island) means, or 
should mean, state planning", the state guide plan will take into account 
the metropolitan nature of many of Rhode Island's problems. 
_(3)_ It will continue to be an objective of this division to encourage 
the acceptance of planning as a proper and continuing responsibility 
of local government. To this end, the community assistance program 
of the planning division will continue to be operated as a staff function 
to make available, on a shared cost basis, technical planning 
assistance to those communities in the state unable to maintain their 
own planning staff. _(4)_ The planning division will take the initiative 
in encouraging planning cooperation at all levels of government; 
among the operating departments of the state; between the cities 
and towns of the state; and on a regional basis between the six New 
England states. _(5)_ On the basis that all citizens of the state 
are entitled to benefit equally in the development of its resources, 
plans for the provision of essential services (such as water) will 
be based on need regardless of arbitrary political boundaries, within 
the framework of the state plan. _(6)_ The state development budget 
will reflect the capital needs of all the state agencies and the priority 
of the projects in the budget will be based on the state plan. 
_(7)_ In preparing the state guide plan, particular attention will 
be given means of strengthening the economy of the state through the 
development of industry and recreation.   Functionally the planning 
division carries out four activities: long-range state planning, 
current state planning, local planning assistance; and the preparation 
of the state development budget. _LONG RANGE STATE PLANNING_ 
The planning division has embarked on the most complete and comprehensive 
state planning program in the nation. The long range aspects of 
this program are divided into four distinct phases: basic mapping, 
inventory, analysis and plan and policy formation. The work program, 
as it was originally proposed, was to take five years to complete. Recent 
events- particularly the necessity of providing planning information 
for the statewide origin/destination study of the Department 
of Public Works- indicate that this schedule will have to be accelerated. 
The basic mapping phase of the program has been completed and 
the inventory phase is scheduled for completion July 1, 1961. _BASIC 
MAPPING_ Since accurate base maps are necessary for any planning 
program, the first step taken by the planning division to implement the 
long range state plan has been to prepare two series of base maps- 
one at a scale of 1 inch to a mile, and the second a series of 26 sheets 
at a scale of 1 inch to 2000 feet, covering the entire state. With 
these maps completed, the inventory phase of the plan has been started. 
_INVENTORY_ With the aid of matching federal funds available 
under Section 701 of the Housing Act of 1954 as amended, the planning 
division began a one year program July 1, 1960 to complete the inventory 
phase of the state planning program. this phase consists of four 
items: urban land use, rural land use, physical features and public 
utility service areas. Since the validity of all subsequent planning 
depends on the accuracy of the basic inventory information, great care 
is being taken that the inventory is as complete as possible.

The urban land use study carried out by the planning division staff 
has consisted of identifying and mapping all urban land uses which are 
of significance to statewide planning. The rural land use study is 
being carried out under contract by the University of Rhode Island 
and identifies all agricultural land uses in the state by type of use. 
The mapping of important physical features such as slopes and types 
of soil and the collection of all available information pertaining to 
public utility service areas are being conducted as staff projects and, 
like the other two inventory projects, are scheduled for completion 
July 1, 1961. _ANALYSIS_ The collection of information is meaningless 
unless it is understood and used for a definite purpose. 
_SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN RHODE ISLAND._ It is not within the scope of 
this report elaborate in any great detail upon special districts in 
Rhode Island. However, a word should be mentioned in regard to them 
as independent units of government.   There are forty-seven special 
district governments in Rhode Island (excluding two regional school 
districts, four housing authorities, and the Kent County Water 
Authority). These forty-seven special purpose governments have the 
authority to levy taxes, to borrow money, own property, sue and be sued, 
and in general to exercise normal corporate powers. Unlike cities 
and towns, however, they do not have to submit any financial statements 
to the state Bureau of Audits. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that the state government has little or no fiscal control over these units 
of government. In addition to the collection of service charges, 
the special districts levy annual property taxes of approximately $450,000. 

#FISCAL YEARS IN OTHER STATES#

_COMPARATIVE DATA._ A 
review of practices in other states regarding fiscal uniformity is pertinent 
to this report. Included in the findings are: _1._ Forty-six 
states, including Rhode Island, end their fiscal year on June 
30. The other four states end on varying dates: Alabama (Sept& 
30), New York (March 31), Pennsylvania (May 31), and Texas (August 
31). _2._ In sixteen states, the fiscal year ending of the 
cities (June 30) is the same as that of the state: Alaska, Arizona, 
California, Delaware, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont, 
West Virginia, Wyoming, and Hawaii). _3._ In eleven states, 
the fiscal year of the cities ends on December 31, while the state fiscal 
year ends on June 30 (Arkansas, Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, 
and Wisconsin). _4._ In eight states whose fiscal years close 
on June 30, a majority of their cities close their fiscal year on December 
31: (Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, 
Virginia, and South Carolina). _5._ One state, Alabama, closes 
its fiscal year on September 30, and all cities in the state, with 
one exception, also close fiscal years on September 30. _6._ 
Mississippi closes its fiscal year on June 30, while all of its cities 
close their fiscal years on September 30. _7._ Pennsylvania closes 
its fiscal year on May 31. All of its cities close their fiscal 
years on December 31.   The remaining twelve states have varying 
fiscal years for the state, city and local governments. However, 
only Illinois, Oregon, Louisiana and Rhode Island have a situation 
in which the sundry units of government vary widely in relation to fiscal 
uniformity. 

#FISCAL UNIFORMITY: ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES# 

_ADVANTAGES._ An excellent summary of advantages concerning 
the uniform fiscal year and coordinated fiscal calendars was contained 
in a paper presented by a public finance authority recently. He listed 
among the values of fiscal uniformity: _1._ The uniform fiscal 
year requires compliance with common sense administration of local 
finances: adoption of the budget, or financial plan, in advance of spending. 
_2._ The uniform fiscal year ensures conformance with another 
common sense rule, that of having cash in the bank before checks 
are drawn. It enables towns to make more economical purchases and to 
take advantage of cash discounts. _3._ The uniform fiscal year promotes 
more careful budgeting and strengthens control over expenditures. 
By fixing the tax rate in advance of spending, upper limits are set 
on expenditures. _4._ The uniform fiscal year brings the town's 
fiscal year into line with that of the schools, which expend the largest 
share of local disbursements. This greatly simplifies the town's 
bookkeeping and financial reporting. _5._ The uniform fiscal 
year eliminates interest charges on money borrowed in the form of tax 
anticipation notes. Furthermore, tax collections not immediately needed 
for current expenditures may be invested in short-term treasury notes, 
augmenting the town's miscellaneous revenues and reducing the tax 
levy. _6._ The uniform fiscal year facilitates inter-town comparison 
of revenues and expenditures. When towns have the same fiscal 
year it is relatively easy to make meaningful comparisons; and as the 
cost of local government increases, the demand for such comparison also 
increases. Towns having different fiscal years are difficult to compare.

Of all advantages, probably none is more important than 
the elimination of tax anticipation notes. Borrowing in anticipation 
of current taxes and other revenues is a routine procedure of the majority 
of municipalities at all times. It may be by bank loans, sale 
of notes or warrants, or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and 
registration of warrants. In any event it is a form of borrowing which 
could be and should be rendered unnecessary. Its elimination would 
result in the saving of interest costs, heavy when short-term money rates 
are high, and in freedom from dependence on credit which is not always 
available when needed most. This type of borrowing can be reduced 
to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of taxes is instituted 
and the first payment placed near the opening of the fiscal year. Any 
approach 
toward such a system looks toward saving and security. 
It should be noted that there are other and equally important reasons 
for establishing meaningful intergovernmental reporting bases on a uniform 
fiscal year. Both the federal and state governments commence their 
fiscal years on July 1. Both units of government contribute increasingly 
large sums of money to the several local governments in this 
state as indicated below: @   It has been said that when local 
government revenues were mostly produced locally from the property 
tax, the lack of a uniform fiscal year was no great handicap; but with 
the growth of state and federal fiscal aid, the emphasis on equalization, 
and the state-local sharing of responsibility for certain important 
functions, this is no longer true. The haphazard fiscal year calendar 
is an obstacle to the planning of clear and efficient state-local 
revenue and expenditure relationships. _DISADVANTAGES._ Although 
there are many sound reasons for adopting uniform and coordinated fiscal 
years in Rhode Island, there are also certain difficulties encountered. 
These involve more the mechanics employed in adjusting to fiscal 
uniformity than they do actual actual disadvantages to the principle. 
One problem is a matter of shifting dates; the other, is how to 
finance the transition.   Little can be done about the changing 
of dates. This is an inherent part of adjusting fiscal calendars. It 
usually means a confused and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period 
of time. But cooperation and understanding between local officials 
and the citizenry help lessen this problem.   The other problem 
is the matter of financing the transition period in the several cities 
and towns. This will be covered more fully later. It should be kept 
in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can 
convert to the proposed plan is directly dependent upon the financial 
condition of that town or city. Fortunately, there are no cities or towns 
in the state, with one or two possible exceptions that are in too 
difficult a position to finance the proposed change. Sacrifice will 
have to be made in some cases, but it is to the municipality's advantage 
to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than 
pay interest on tax anticipation notes indefinitely. 

#ADJUSTING THE 
FISCAL CALENDARS#

The advantages of a uniform fiscal year and well 
synchronized fiscal and tax collection calendars are sufficiently great 
for Rhode Island municipalities to exert effort to secure them. The 
type of program desired can be determined by the nature and extent 
of the adjustments needed. Two features are immediately evident. First, 
the present situation is too varied to be systematized by any single 
formula. Second, the shift to a uniform July 1-June 30 fiscal year 
will, of itself, improve the tax collection calendars of the great
