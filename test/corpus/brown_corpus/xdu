this play. We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare 
speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment 
to that which has already been discredited and proved false.

Even Mr& Miller himself seems uncertain on this score. In 
a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the 
first act of the play, he says at one point: "However, that experience 
never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld 
or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced lieutenants. And his 
belief is not to his discredit. Better minds than Hale's were- 
and still are- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond 
our ken". (page 33) On the other hand, a little later on he says: 
"Since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out God's 
beard and the Devil's horns, but the world is still gripped between 
two diametrically opposed absolutes. The concept of unity, in which 
positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good 
and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always joined to the same phenomenon- 
such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences 
and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas **h. When we see 
the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's 
worthlessness- until redeemed- the necessity of the Devil may 
become evident as a weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time 
again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church 
or church-state". (page 34)   Apparently he does not intend 
that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being 
actually real. Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that 
the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and 
potency of that which came over Salem. It casts a spell upon them 
so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence 
of an evil power. It is not enough in accounting for this feeling 
to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together 
to produce a cumulative effect. For this does not account for the 
integral, elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as 
the play unfolds, nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness 
which comes over those who watch the play like a spell. The 
reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions 
to the contrary. 

#SPIRIT AND COMMUNITY#
 
 There is 
nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and 
universally felt than spirit. Apart from spirit there could be no community, 
for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any 
community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence. Think, for example, 
of the spirit of the Marine Corps. Surely this is a reality we 
all acknowledge. We cannot, of course, assign it any substance. It 
is not material and is not a "thing" occupying space and time. Yet 
it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and 
known. So it is too with many other spirits which we all know: the 
spirit of Nazism or Communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street 
corner gang or a football team, the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux 
Klan. Every community, if it is alive has a spirit, and that spirit 
is the center of its unity and identity.   In searching for clues 
which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit, 
the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove 
the most fruitful. For it is primarily in community that we know and 
experience spirit. It is spirit which gives life to a community and 
causes it to cohere. It is the spirit which is the source of a community's 
drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from 
the world outside so that the community grows and prospers. Yet the 
spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community. 
The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable 
ideas.   One characteristic of the spirit in community is 
its givenness. The members of the community do not create the spirit 
but rather find it present and waiting for them. It is for them a given 
which they and they alone possess. The spirit of the Marine Corps 
was present and operative before any of the present members of it came 
into it. It is they, of course, who keep it alive and preserve it 
so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future 
recruits to find as they come into it. 
If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be 
"understanded of the people"- and this, it must not be forgotten, 
is one of the goals of the perennial theological task- there is 
no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of 
representation.

This does not mean that mythological language as 
such can no longer be used in theology and preaching. The absurd notion 
that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological 
concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention. His point 
is not that mythology may not be used, but that it may no longer be regarded 
as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing 
the Christian kerygma. When we say that a mythological mode 
of thought must be completely abandoned, we mean it must be abandoned 
as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding 
of existence. Mythological concepts may by all means still be used, 
but they can be used responsibly only as "symbols" or "ciphers", 
that is, only if they are also constantly <interpreted> in nonmythological 
(or existential) terms.   The statement is often made 
that when Bultmann argues in this way, he "overestimates the intellectual 
stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting 
the Christian faith". But this statement is completely unconvincing. 
If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered 
to (and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who 
make such pronouncements), the evidence is overwhelming that he does 
not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of 
traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant. Nor is 
it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our 
culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly 
estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been 
communicated. On the contrary, even in the heart of "the Bible 
belt" itself, as can be attested by any one who is called to work there, 
the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under 
way, together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself 
and his world.   In fact, it is in just such a situation 
that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed. Although 
the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do 
not in a more secularized situation, the striking thing is the rapidity 
with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence. This is 
especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle 
class. Time and again in counseling and teaching, one encounters 
members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity 
the insubstantial mythologies of their "fundamentalist" heritage 
and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious.

The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme "culture-Protestantism" 
so often observed to characterize the preaching 
and teaching of the American churches. In the absence of a truly adequate 
conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed, the unavoidable 
need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at 
hand- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of 
"folk religion" current in the situation. This is not to say that 
the <only> explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent 
Peale's "cult of reassurance" or the other types of a purely 
cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized 
gospel. But it is to say that this need is far more important for such 
infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected.

However, even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly 
as widespread as we are claiming, at least among the cultured elements 
of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference 
to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace. To be 
sure, when this is pointed out, a common response among certain churchmen 
is to fulminate about "the little flock" and "the great crowd" 
and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the "wisdom of 
the wise" in the opening chapter of First Corinthians. But can 
we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation? Can the church 
risk assuming that the "folly" of men is as dear to God as their 
"wisdom", or, as is also commonly implied, that "the foolishness 
of God" and "the foolishness of men" are simply two ways 
of talking about the same thing? Can we continue to alienate precisely 
those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation 
our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious?

There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church (which 
derives, however, from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from 
the Bible) that God is completely independent of his creation and 
so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world. by analogy, 
the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the 
"world" in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be 
the church. But, as Scripture everywhere reminds us, God <does> 
have need of his creatures, and the church, <a fortiori>, can ill afford 
to do without the talents with which the world, by God's providence, 
presents it.   And yet this is exactly the risk we run when 
we assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to preach the gospel 
in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured 
men. Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened 
men today can understand, we are depriving ourselves of the very resources 
on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends.

In arguing in this way, we are obviously taking for granted 
that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved; 
and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when 
we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction. But the main point 
here is that even if such a restatement were <not> possible, the 
demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable. 
This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without 
condition. If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise 
say no, or where I do not have the right to say anything at all, then 
my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian. Expressed differently: 
if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ 
is some form of self-destruction, whether of the body or of the mind- 
<sacrificium corporis, sacrificium intellectus>- then there is 
no alternative but that the price remain unpaid.   This must be 
stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding 
chapter. Modern man, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us, has 
"come of age"; and though this process by no means represents 
an unambiguous gain and is, in fact, marked by the estrangement from 
the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation, it is still 
a positive step forward; and those of us who so richly benefit from 
it should be the last to despise it. In any event, it is an irreversible 
step, and if we are at all honest with ourselves, we will know we 
have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has 
seen fit to place us.   To say this, of course, is to take up a 
position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred 
years, or, at any rate, since the beginning of the distinctively modern 
period in theological thought. We have aligned ourselves with that 
"liberal" tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among 
the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl, 
Herrmann, Harnack, and Troeltsch, and more recently, Schweitzer and 
the early Barth and, in part at least, Bultmann. It is to this same 
tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and 
a half of American theology also belong. For we must number here not 
only the names of Bushnell, Clarke, and Rauschenbusch, not to mention 
those of "the Chicago School" and Macintosh, but those of 
the brothers Niebuhr and (if America may claim him!) Tillich as 
well. Finally, we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously 
"neoliberal" movement that developed at the University 
of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work
