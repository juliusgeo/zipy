have to get back to Jarrodsville", he went on. "I see there are 
some cars here. I wonder if one of you gentlemen could drive me back 
to town? I'd be happy to pay for the favor, of course".

The seventeen men stood and stared at him for a moment longer. And 
then a startling thing occurred. It was so utterly unexpected that 
Marty stood for several moments with his mouth hanging open foolishly 
after it had happened.   There was no word spoken, no apparent 
signal given.   Yet the men all moved at the same instant.

They piled into the waiting cars, motors roared, the cars sped off.

The station wagon and the old Plymouth headed east toward Jarrodsville. 
The Ford and the pickup truck sped west toward Sanford's 
Run.   In seconds all four cars were out of sight. 
Marty Land stood alone on a red-clay road as storm clouds gathered ominously 
in the sky again. From a great distance thunder growled and 
broke the silence.   Land looked back toward the dilapidated house. 
He thought he saw a pale face at a window. Perhaps it was Dora 
May. Perhaps she would be glad that they hadn't hurt him.   There 
were other farmhouses nearby. Across the road there was one no 
more than a hundred yards away. There was another on this side, a little 
further down. There were many more between here and Jarrodsville. 
Telephone poles lined the road. They reared tall and mocking. Their 
wires stretched out into infinity. Not a single strand of wire reached 
into the silent houses beside the red-clay road.   There was 
nothing he could do but walk. And Jarrodsville was more than three 
miles away, down an old dirt road that the rain had turned into a quagmire.

Marty faced east and started walking down the left side 
of the road. After he had proceeded a few feet, he paused and turned 
up the cuffs of his trousers, which were already damp and mud-caked. 
The viscous mud was ankle-deep, and in places great puddles spread across 
the road and reflected the murky light.   As he approached 
the first farmhouse, thunder sounded behind him again, closer now and 
louder, like a steadily advancing drum corps. There were several people 
on the porch of the farmhouse. There was a very old man and a young 
woman and a brood of children ranging from toddlers to teen-agers. 
For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help. Perhaps 
they had a car or truck and would drive him into town. Then he realized 
the utter futility of the idea. They were staring at him in the same 
blank and menacing way that the men outside the gate had stared. Even 
the eyes of the smallest children seemed malicious.   On his 
side of the road there were two farm hands, well back in a field, leaning 
against a plow. They, too, stared at him.   The drums of 
thunder were right behind him now.   A foolish thought came into 
his head. He remembered a story he had read as a youth. It was probably 
one of Kipling's tales of the British Army. It concerned an officer 
who had been disgraced and drummed out. The steady roll of the drums 
had sounded behind him as he walked between the endless ranks of 
the men he had commanded, and each man about-faced and turned his back 
as the officer approached. Marty wished these poor farm people would 
turn their backs.   The fencing by the roadside ended. Now the 
dirt highway was bordered on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch, 
too broad to leap over unless you were an Olympic star. The day's 
rain had been added to the stagnant water. He was trapped on the 
road when he heard the sound of an approaching car. It was coming toward 
him. The car was now in sight. Marty's heart skipped a beat when 
he recognized it. It was the station wagon that had passed his cab 
on the road, the station wagon that had been parked at the Burch farm. 
Acey Squire's station wagon. It had headed back toward Jarrodsville. 
That had only been a ruse to lure him out on the deserted road. 
Now Acey and his friends were returning to seek him out. 
The station wagon came to a stop a couple of hundred feet in front of 
him, beside a fenced field. Then there was another sound. A second 
car was coming from the west, from the direction of Sanford's Run. 
It was the Ford that had been outside Burch's farm.   Marty 
looked helplessly in both directions. It was a narrow road, barely 
wide enough for two cars to pass. He could not leave the road because 
of the water-filled drainage ditch. When the two cars were equidistant 
from him, the station wagon started up again and the Ford gathered 
speed. They bore down on him. There was nothing he could do except 
jump into the ditch.   He jumped, and sank to his knees in muddy 
water.   As the two cars roared by, there was a high-pitched eerie, 
nerve-shattering sound. Marty knew how the Union soldiers must 
have felt at Chancellorsville and Antietam and Gettysburg when the 
ragged gray ranks charged at them, screaming the wild banshee howl they 
called the Rebel yell.   For moments he stood in water, shivering 
and gasping for breath. He had turned his ankle slightly, and it 
pained him. The cars, with their load of howling men, had disappeared 
in the distance. There had been two more cars parked at the farm, 
a Plymouth and a pickup truck. They would be coming for him next, bearing 
down on him from both directions. And then the station wagon and 
the Ford would seek him out again. He would be harassed repeatedly 
and would escape death by inches time after time, all the way to Jarrodsville. 
He still had three miles to go. Back East the more affluent 
juvenile delinquents, who could afford hyped-up autos instead of 
switch blades as lethal weapons, played this same game and called it 
"Chicken".   He could not go through the fields. That way 
was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence. He 
had to make for the section of road just ahead that was bordered by the 
rail fence, the section by the farmhouse. At least he could climb 
up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again. The Admassy place 
could not be far now. He would go in there, climb through the window, 
and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest. There 
was even a bare chance that the phone had not been disconnected.

He did not dare climb back up to the road. He was deep in water, but 
at least they could not reach him there. He splashed on, mud sucking 
at his feet with each step, until he reached the end of the drainage 
ditch and the beginning of the fence that enclosed the farm. He climbed 
back to the road, and he felt utterly exhausted. He stood, panting, 
for a moment. And then he saw something that he had not seen before, 
and panic gripped him again.   The fence, his only refuge when 
the metal death came roaring at him, was made of rails, all right, 
but the rails were protected by a thick screening of barbed wire that 
would rip his flesh if he pressed against it. He lurched on down the 
road despairingly, because there was no place else to go.   He lost 
all sense of dignity. You could not stand on dignity when you were 
soaked and muddied and your life was at stake. Probably people were 
watching him from the porch or from behind the windows of this farmhouse, 
too, but he did not bother to look. He broke into a dogtrot, breathing 
heavily, streaming with sweat. He had to reach Admassy's place. 
It was his only sanctuary. The fences on both sides of the road 
bristled with the barbed wire. The fences stretched on endlessly.

And then he heard them.   And now he saw them.   The 
Plymouth was coming at him from the east, the pickup truck from the west. 
They had timed it better this time. They would reach him at almost 
exactly the same instant. He stopped stone-still. If he backed 
against the fence, one of the cars would brush him as it passed, and he 
would be cruelly lacerated by the wire.   He stumbled to the middle 
of the road and simply stood there, waiting for them, a perfect 
target.   The cars must have had their gas pedals pushed down to 
the floor boards. They were coming on at reckless speed for such old 
vehicles. They thundered at him. He held his arms close to his sides 
and made himself as small as possible. When the Plymouth neared, it 
veered toward him and seemed about to run him down. He forced himself 
to stay frozen there. If he moved, he would be in the path of the 
other car. He thought the fender of the Plymouth brushed his jacket 
as it went by. In a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtled by 
on the other side.   The weird, insane sound of the Rebel yell 
reverberated again and echoed from the distant hills.   He did not 
leave the middle of the road. He did not try to run. He trudged on, 
his aching eyes focused straight ahead. He was nearing the Admassy 
house. He was going to make it, he told himself. And then he heard 
a car coming from the east, and he felt as if he would break down and 
weep.   "Oh, no, not again", he said aloud. "Not again so 
soon".   There was a new sound, a sound as piercing as the Rebel 
yell, yet different. It was the sound of a siren. Now he saw that 
the approaching car was painted white, and he began to wave his arms 
frantically. It was the prowl car from the sheriff's office.

The car drew up alongside him and stopped.   "Get in", 
Charley Estes said brusquely.   He staggered into the back seat 
and lay back, fighting for breath. There was someone in front with 
the sheriff. It was Pete Holmes, the cabdriver.   Pete turned 
around and said to Marty, "I guess you think I'm a yellow-bellied 
hound. But there wasn't no use in me staying there. I couldn't 
fight a dozen or so of 'em. If I'd stayed, all that I'd have 
got was four punctured tires and one busted head. Why didn't you 
wait at the Burch house? You must've known I'd gone to get 
the sheriff. I was lucky they let me go, I guess".   The sheriff 
was occupied with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space. 
When it was finally pointed east, he said, "You should never have 
come out here alone. This is redneck country. Every man in every 
one of these houses is a Night Rider.

Then he turned the telephone over to Rourke, and went into the 
bedroom to change his slippers for dry socks and shoes. Rourke was 
talking on the phone when he came back. "About an hour, eh? Are 
you positive"? He listened a moment and then said, "Hold it". 
He turned his head and said, "Alvarez will definitely be in a back 
room at the Jai Alai Club on South Beach within an hour. Want 
to try and meet him there"?   Shayne looked at his watch. That 
wasn't too far from Fifth Street, and should allow him to make 
Scotty's Bar by midnight. He said with satisfaction, "That's 
fine, Tim. I'll be there".   Rourke confirmed the appointment 
over the phone and hung up. "I don't know what you're getting 
into, Mike", he said unhappily. "I hope to Christ **h".

Shayne said briskly, "Grab another drink if you want it. We've 
got one other call to make before I meet Alvarez". 
"Where"?   "It's out in the Northeast section. Have 
you got my car here"?   "It's parked in front". Rourke 
hastily slopped whiskey into his glass on top of half-melted ice-cubes.

"I'd better keep on driving yours", Shayne decided, 
"because I'll be going on over to the Beach. I can drop you back 
here to pick mine up". He went to a closet to get a light jacket, 
and took his hat from beside the door. Timothy Rourke gulped down 
the whiskey hastily and joined him, asking, "Who are we going to call 
on in the Northeast section"?   "A lady. That is, maybe 
not too much of a lady. At least, I want to find out whether she's 
home yet or not". He opened the door and followed Rourke out.

In Rourke's car, Shayne drove east to Biscayne Boulevard 
and north toward Felice Perrin's address which had been given to 
him by the Peralta governess. As he drove, he filled in Timothy Rourke 
briefly on the events of the evening after leaving the reporter 
to go to the Peralta house, and on his own surmises.   "I want 
to be in Scotty's Bar at midnight when Marsha makes her phone call 
there", he ended grimly. "I don't know whether that threatening 
letter of hers has anything to do with this situation or not, but 
I want to see who takes the call".   "This deal at <Las 
Putas Buenas> where the two knife-men jumped you", said Rourke with 
interest, "that sounds like it was set up with malice aforethought 
by the luscious Mrs& Peralta, doesn't it"?   "It 
does", Shayne grunted sourly, still able to taste her mouth on his 
in
