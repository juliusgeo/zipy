The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded 
a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over 
Chicago yesterday.   The reading, which has been watched 
with 
interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was 4 
on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below the danger point, 
according to the board of health.   The weather bureau has estimated 
that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week. 
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that 
an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation.

Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake av&, Wilmette, was arrested 
yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling 
an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings 
and Loan association, 1 S& Dearborn st&, where he formerly 
was employed 
as an attorney.   Federal prosecutors estimated that the 
amount may total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association estimated 
its loss at approximately $10,000. 

#LIEN PAYMENTS INVOLVED# 

Huff's attorney, Antone F& Gregorio, quoted his client as saying 
that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff, as 
attorney for the loan association, in satisfaction of mechanic's liens 
on property on which the association held mortgages.   Huff told 
Gregorio that he took the money to pay "the ordinary bills and 
expenses of suburban living".   Huff, who received a salary of 
$109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September 
of this year, said that his private practice was not lucrative. 
Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their four children, 6 to 10 years 
old, in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage. 

#CHARGE LISTS 3 
CHECKS#

The complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by 
Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.   The shortage was 
discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept& 18. On 
that date, according to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room 
in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence av&. There, Gregorio 
said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense.   Later, 
Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House, using 
a credit card. All bounced.   When Huff attempted to cash another 
$100 check there Monday, hotel officials called police.

PROBABLY THE hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment 
community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue, which was 
sold to the public during the past week.   For many reasons, the 
demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous. 
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the 
stock; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers 
and explaining to others why they had no more to sell.   Investors 
who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25, and customers 
who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 
and counted themselves lucky to get that many.   In fact, very 
few customers, anywhere in the nation, were able to get more than 100 
shares. Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares, for all of 
their customers.   A measure of how hot the stock was, can be 
found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.

The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share. 
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler, 
Guerin + Turner, the managing underwriter, was at $17 a share. And 
from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday 
morning at around $22 a share.   But the Morton Foods issue 
was hot long before it was on the market. Indeed, from the moment the 
reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last 
January, the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up.

Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the 
nation, all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would 
be sold (185,000 to the public at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved 
for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share).   There was even 
a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned 
about the Dallas stock offering. "We subscribe 500 shares of Morton 
Foods of Texas. Cable confirmation", it said translated. But 
E&G&T& could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares.

After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group 
members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.

But the result of it all was, E&G&T& partner Dean Guerin 
believes, an effective distribution of the stock to owners all 
over the nation.   "I feel confident the stock will qualify for 
the 'national list'", he said, meaning its market price would 
be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country.   He was 
also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved 
again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a 
job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do.

But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one?

The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.

First, the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last 
few months, driving stocks of all kinds up. As a result, it is not 
easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced (at roughly 
10 times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64~c 
anticipated dividend).   Second, the "potato chip industry" 
has caught the fancy of investors lately, and until Morton Foods 
came along there were only two potato chip stocks- Frito and H& 
W& Lay- on the market.   Both of those have had dynamic run-ups 
in price on the market in recent months, both were selling at higher 
price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market 
at, and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock 
to have a fast run-up.   And third, the potato chip industry has 
taken on the flavor of a "growth" industry in the public mind of 
late. Foods, which long had been considered "recession resistant" 
but hardly dynamic stocks, have been acting like growth stocks, going 
to higher price-earnings ratios.   The potato chip industry these 
days is growing, not only as a 
result of population increase and public 
acceptance of convenience foods, but also because of a combination 
of circumstances 
that has led to growth by merger.   The history of the 
U&S& potato chip industry is that many of today's successful 
companies got started during the deep depression days. Those that remain 
are those that were headed by strong executives, men with the abilities 
to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.

But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and 
suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their 
closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management 
in their firms.   So they go looking for mergers with other 
firms that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they pound on 
the doors of firms like Frito.   All those things combined to 
make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.

Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known as Chip-o's, 
turns out to sell as well as its stock did, the stock may turn out 
to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up 
to. 
Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and 
distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies, valued in the 
millions of dollars.   More than 10 companies maintain facilities 
in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at 
Sherman.   It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's 
Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 
52-year history.   The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at 
the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars. It 
weighs in the tons, so the proximity of factory and exhibition area 
makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year.   A modern 
cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000, and it's 
a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U&S& 
and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area. 
The Murray Co& of Texas, Inc&, originated in Dallas in 1896. 
They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's. More than 
700 employes make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown.

Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except 
for driers and cleaners, and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based 
firm.   The Continental Gin Co& began operations in 
Dallas in 1899. The present company is a combination of several smaller 
ones that date back to 1834.   Headquarters is in Birmingham, 
Ala&. Factories are located here and in Prattville, Ala&. 
About 
40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by 
more than 200 employes.   The company sells a complete line of 
gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world.   Hardwicke-Etter 
Co& of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment. 
The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern 
states as a result of an agreement with Cen-Tennial Gin Co&. They 
export also.   The company began operation in 1900 with hardware 
and oil mill supplies. In 1930, they began making cotton processing 
equipment. Presently, Hardwicke-Etter employs 300-450 people, depending 
on the season of the year.   The Lummus Cotton Gin Co& 
has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912. Factory 
operations are in Columbus, Ga&. The district office here employs 
about 65.   The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co& and Gordin 
Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here. The cleaner 
equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system, which 
turns out a complete ginning system, began operations in 1959. 
Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.   The John E& 
Mitchell Co& began work in Dallas in 1928. The firm is prominent 
in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton, driers, and heaters, 
and they lay claim to being the first maker (1910) of boil extraction 
equipment.   The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes 
cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation.

Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people. They export cotton 
ginning machinery.   The Hinckley Gin Supply Co& is a maker 
of "overhead equipment". This includes driers, cleaners, burr 
extractors, separators and piping that's located above gin stands in 
a complete gin.   The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells 
equipment in the central cotton belt, including the Mississippi 
Delta.   The Cen-Tennial Gin Supply Co& has home offices 
and factory facilities here. They make gin saws and deal in parts, supplies 
and some used gin machinery.   The Stacy Co& makes cleaning 
and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas. They've been 
in Dallas since 1921.   Cotton Belt Gin Service, Inc& 
of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago. They distribute 
equipment in 11 states. The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies
