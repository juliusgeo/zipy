from the hen who had begun to protest. It was Giselle, the <fille de 
chambre>, come to clean the room, and while she stood before him with 
ears pricked up and regard all curiosity, explaining her errand, Alex 
could see from the corner of his eye the doctor doing all he could 
to calm the displeased bird. Giselle was reluctant but Alex succeeded 
in persuading her to come back in five minutes and the door was shut 
again.   "Who was that, young feller"? the doctor instantly 
asked.   "That was the <fille de chambre>, the one you thought 
couldn't get the eggs out. She looked mighty interested, though. 
Anyhow she's coming back in five minutes to do the room".

The doctor's mind was working at a great speed; he rose to put 
his greatcoat on and addressed Alex in a muted voice.   "Have 
you got our keys handy"?   "Right in my pocket".

"All right. Now you go outside and beckon me when it's safe". 
The hall was empty and Alex beckoned; they climbed the stairs 
which creaked, very loudly to their sensitive ears, and reached the next 
floor. A guest was locking his room; they passed behind him and 
got to Alex's room unnoticed. The doctor sat down rather wearily, 
caressing the hen and remarking that the city was not the place for a 
poultry-loving man, but no sooner was the remark out than a knock at this 
door obliged him to cover the hen with his greatcoat once more. At 
the door Alex managed to persuade the increasingly astonished <fille 
de chambre> to return in ten minutes. It was evident that a second 
transfer had to be effected, and that it had to take place between the 
time the <fille> finished the doctor's room and the time she began 
Alex's. They waited three minutes and then crept out on tip-toe; 
the halls were empty and they passed down the stairs to number nine 
and listened at the door. A bustle of sheets being smoothed and pillows 
being arranged indicated the <fille de chambre's> presence inside; 
they listened and suddenly a step towards the door announced 
another important fact. The doctor shot down to the lavatory and turned 
the doorknob, but to no effect: the lavatory was occupied. Although 
a look of alarm passed over his face, he did not arrest his movements 
but disappeared into the shower room just as the chambermaid emerged 
from number nine. Alex suppressed those expressions of relief which 
offered to prevail in his face and escape from his throat; unwarranted 
they were in any case for, as he stood facing the <fille de chambre>, 
his ears were assailed by new sounds from the interior of the shower 
room. The events of the last quarter of an hour, mysterious to 
any bird accustomed only to the predictable life of coop and barnyard, 
had overcome the doctor's hen and she gave out a series of cackly wails, 
perhaps mourning her nest, but briefly enjoyed. The doctor's 
wits had not left him, however, for all his sixty-eight years, and the 
wails were almost immediately lost in the sound of water rushing out 
from the showerhead. Alex nodded to the maid as though nothing unusual 
were taking place and entered the doctor's room. Shortly, the doctor 
himself entered, his hair somewhat wet from the shower, but evidently 
satisfied with the outcome of their adventures. Without comment he 
opened the closet and from its shelves constructed a highboard around 
the egg case which he had placed on the floor inside. Next, the hen 
was nested and all seemed well. The two men sat for some time, savoring 
the pleasure of escape from peril and the relief such escape brings, 
before they got up and left the hotel, the doctor to go to the conference 
house and Alex to go to the main post office.   Alex returned 
to the hotel, rather weary and with no new prospects of a role, 
in the late afternoon, but found the doctor in an ebullient mood. At 
the time Alex arrived he was engaged in some sort of intimate communication 
with the hen, who had settled herself on the nest most peacefully 
after the occurrences of the morning.   "Chickens have short 
memories", the doctor remarked, "that's why they are better company 
than most people I know", and he went on to break some important 
news to Alex. "Well", he began, "It seems like some people 
in Paris want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference 
house do. They've got a big vulture from Tanganika at the 
zoo here, with a wife for him, too, very rare birds, both of them, the 
only Vulturidae of their species outside Africa. Seems like 
she's 
willing, but the male just flops around all day like the bashful boy 
who took Jeannie May behind the barn and then didn't know what to 
do, and the people at the zoo haven't got any vulture chicks to show 
for their trouble.

Going downstairs with the tray, Winston wished he could have 
given in to Miss Ada, but he knew better than to do what she said when 
she had that little-girl look. There were times it wasn't right 
to make a person happy, like the times she came in the kitchen and asked 
for a peanut butter sandwich. "You know we don't keep peanut butter 
in this house", he always told her. "Why, Winston", she'd 
cry, "I just now saw you eating it out of the jar"! But he 
knew how important it was for her to keep her figure. ##

In the 
kitchen, Leona, his little young wife, was reading the morning paper. 
Her legs hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool.

"Here", Winston said gently, "what's these dishes doing not 
washed"? The enormous plates which had held Mr& Jack's four 
fried eggs and five strips of bacon were still stacked in the sink.

"Leave me alone", Leona said. "Can't you see I'm 
busy"? She looked at him impudently over the corner of the paper.

"This is moving day", Winston reminded her, "and I bet 
you left things every which way upstairs, your clothes all over the 
floor and the bed not made. Leona"! His eye had fastened on her 
leg; bending, he touched her knee. "If I catch you one more time 
down here without stockings"-   She twitched her leg away. 
"Fuss, fuss, old man". She had an alley cat's manners. 
Winston stacked Miss Ada's thin pink dishes in the sink. Then he 
spread out the last list on the counter. "To Be Left Behind" 
was printed at the top in Miss Ada; fine hand. Winston took out 
a pencil, admired the point, and wrote slowly and heavily, "Clothes 
Stand".   Sighing, Leona dropped the paper and stood up. "I 
guess I better get ready to go".   Winston watched her fumbling 
to untie her apron. "Here". Carefully, he undid the bow. 
"How come your bows is always cockeyed"?   She turned and 
put her arms around his neck. "I don't want to leave here, Winston".

"Now listen to that". He drew back, embarrassed 
and pleased. "I thought you was sick to death of this big house. Said 
you wore yourself out, cleaning all these empty rooms".   "At 
least there is room here", she said. "What room is there going 
to be in an apartment for any child"?   "I told you what 
Miss Ada's doctor said".   "I don't mean Miss Ada! 
What you think I care about that? I mean our children". She 
sounded as though they already existed.   In spite of the hundred 
things he had on his mind, Winston went and put his arm around her 
waist. "We've got plenty of time to think about that. All the 
time in the world. We've only been married four years, January".

"Four years"! she wailed. "That's a long time, waiting".

"How many times have I told you"- he began, and 
was almost glad when she cut him off- "Too many times"!- 
and flounced to the sink, where she began noisily to wash her hands.

Too many times was the truth of it, Winston thought. He hardly 
believed his reason himself any more. Although it had seemed a good 
reason, to begin with: no couple could afford to have children.

"How you going to work with a child hanging on you"? he asked 
Leona. "You want to keep this job, don't you"? He doubted 
whether she heard him, over the running water.   He sat for a 
while with his hands on his knees, watching the bend of her back as she 
gathered up her things- a comb, a bottle of aspirin- to take upstairs 
and pack. She made him sad some days, and he was never sure why; 
it was something to do with her back, the thinness of it, and the 
quick, jerky way she bent. She was too young, that was all; too young 
and thin and straight.   "Winston"!   It was Mr& 
Jack, bellowing out in the hall. Winston hurried through the swinging 
door. "I've been bursting my lungs for you", Mr& Jack 
complained. He was standing in front of the mirror, tightening his tie. 
He had on his gray tweed overcoat and his city hat, and his brief 
case lay on the bench. "I don't know what you think you've been 
doing about my clothes", he said. "This coat looks like a rag heap".

There were a few blades of lint on the shoulder. Winston 
took the clothesbrush out of the closet and went to work. He gave Mr& 
Jack a real going-over; he brushed his shoulders and his back 
and his collar with long, firm strokes. "Hey"! Mr& Jack cried 
when the brush tipped his hat down over his eyes.   Winston 
apologized and quickly set the hat right. Then he stood back to look 
at Mr& Jack, who was pulling on his pigskin gloves. Winston enjoyed 
seeing him start out; he wore his clothes with style. When he was 
going to town, nothing was good enough- he had cursed at Winston 
once for leaving a fleck of polish on his shoelace. At home, he wouldn't 
even wash his hands for supper, and he wandered around the yard 
in a pair of sweaty old corduroys. The velvet smoking jackets, pearl-gray, 
wine, and blue, which Miss Ada had bought him hung brushed and 
unworn in the closet.   "Good-by, Winston", Mr& Jack said, 
giving a final set to his hat. "Look out for those movers"! 
Winston watched him hurry down the drive to his car; a handsome, 
fine-looking man it made him proud to see. ##

After Mr& Jack 
drove away, Winston went on looking out the window. He noticed a speck 
of dirt on the sill and swiped at it with his finger. Then he looked 
at his finger, at the wrinkled, heavy knuckle and the thick nail he 
used like a knife to pry up, slit, and open. For the first time, he 
let himself be sad about the move. That house was ten years off his life. 
Each brass handle and hinge shone for his reward, and he knew how 
to get at the dust in the china flowers and how to take down the long 
glass drops which hung from the chandelier. He knew the house like 
a blind man, through his fingers, and he did not like to think of all 
the time and rags and polishes he had spent on keeping it up. 
Ten years 
ago, he had come to the house to be interviewed. The tulips and the 
big pink peonies had been blooming along the drive, and he had walked 
up from the bus almost singing. Miss Ada had been out back, in a straw 
hat, planting flowers. She had talked to him right there, with the 
hot sun in his face, which made him sweat and feel ashamed. Winston 
had been surprised at her for that. Still, he had liked the way she 
had looked, in a fresh, neat cotton dress- citron yellow, if he remembered. 
She had had a dignity about her, even barefoot and almost too 
tan.   Since then, the flowers she had planted had spread all 
over the hill. Already the jonquils were blooming in a flock by the front 
gate, and the periwinkles were coming on, blue by the porch steps. 
In a week the hyacinths would spike out. And the dogwood in early 
May, for Miss Ada's alfresco party; and after that the Japanese 
cherries. Now the yard looked wet and bald, the trees bare under their 
buds, but in a while Miss Ada's flowers would bloom like a marching 
parade. She had dug a hole for each bulb, each tree wore a tag with 
her writing on it; where would she go for her gardening now? Somehow 
Winston didn't think she'd take to window boxes.   Sighing, 
he hurried to the living room. He had a thousand things to see 
to. Still, he couldn't help thinking, we're all getting old, getting 
small; the snail is pulling in her horns.   In the living 
room, Miss Ada was standing by the window with a sheaf of lists in
