person 
is creative. What does it mean to be creative, a term we hear with increasing 
frequency these days? When we turn to Noah Webster we find 
him helpful as usual. "To be creative is to have the ability to 
cause to exist- to produce where nothing was before- to bring forth 
an original production of human intelligence or power". We are creative, 
it seems, when we produce something which has not previously existed. 
Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake, building 
a chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business, creating 
a League of Nations or, developing a mature character.   All 
living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence 
the power of creativity, if it is only to reproduce a form like their 
own. While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors 
in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal with a true 
non-instinctive and conscious creative ability. An animal, bird or 
insect creates either a burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness 
according to specie. Man's great superiority over these evolutionary 
forbears is in the development of his imagination. This gives him the 
power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories, ideas 
and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment 
in new and ever-changing forms. ##

{I}t has been 
truly said 
that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting 
this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world. In our 
own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne 
come into actuality. The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a 
poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 
1941. In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's 
projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more. It 
is in this one aspect, at least, that man seems to be made in the image 
of his Creator.   Not only can man project his imagination 
out into his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly, 
he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself. 
We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training 
can become athletes, acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing 
many potentialities. We know that actors can learn to portray 
a wide variety of character roles. By this same combination of the 
will and the imagination, each one of us can learn to portray permanently 
the kind of character we would like to be. We must realize with 
Prof& Charles Morris in his THE OPEN SELF that "Man is the 
being that can continually remake himself, the artisan that is himself 
the material for his own creation". ##

{S}o far in 
history man 
has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment 
rather than first creating the sort of person who can make 
the highest use of the things he has created. Is not the present world 
crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us 
and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall 
the tragedy. Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend 
our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our 
own maturing process?   Sir Julian Huxley in his book UNIQUENESS 
OF MAN makes the novel point that just as man is unique in 
being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood 
under family protection, so is he the only animal who has a long 
period after the decline of his procreativity.

SOME recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples 
are a thing of the remote, Victorian past; that nowadays all honeymooners 
are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough 
from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all 
the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.   Perhaps- but extensive 
discussions with contemporary practitioners, family doctors and 
gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance. 
Joking and talking may be freer and easier, but the important factual 
information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men 
and women.   Various factors in the setting can still be of great 
advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad 
memory for one or both. Privacy must be highly assured both in time and 
place. That is, locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of 
location, but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough 
for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.   If the wedding party lasted 
late, and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before 
resuming the trip or making an early start, the husband may forestall 
tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying 
in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours. The 
consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long 
private time (day or night) for that purpose. ##

First intercourse 
for the bride brings with it the various problems connected 
with virginity and the hymen.   <One thing should be clear to 
both husband and wife- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur 
when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act. Ignorance on this 
point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety, misunderstanding 
and suspicion>.   The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane 
that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most 
female human beings who have not had sex relations. (Hymen, in fact, 
is the Greek word for membrane.)   Often it is thin and fragile 
and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse. 
As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed very little 
and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.

It is also important to realize that many girls are born without 
a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one; so that <the absence 
of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex 
relations>.   But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations 
of the folk-lore beliefs. Some hymens are so strongly developed that 
they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked 
loss of blood. More rarely, the hymen is so sturdy that it does not 
yield to penetration.   Extreme cases are on record in which the 
doctor 
has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital 
relations to be consummated. These cases, for all their rarity, are 
so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general 
population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen 
is a serious problem to newly-weds. 
##

In recent times, when sexual 
matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly, 
the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention. 
Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new 
situation. Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of 
making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?

<Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride 
should consult a physician before marriage. If he foresaw any problem 
because of the quality of the hymen, it was recommended that simple 
procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably, 
to dilate it>.   As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was 
often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for 
painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.   This recommendation 
was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth 
consummation of the sex act. The vagina is an organ capable of 
remarkable contraction and dilation. This is obvious when it is remembered 
that, during childbirth, the vagina must dilate enough to permit 
the passage of the baby.   The intricate system of muscles that 
manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under 
voluntary control. But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious 
intention of the woman. That is, when first penetration takes 
place, the pressure and pain signals may <involuntarily> cause all the 
vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent 
further pain. ##

The advantages 
of dilatation by the physician 
are both physical and psychological. Since it is a purely professional 
situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making or the 
beloved. By using instruments of gradually increasing size, the vagina 
is gently, and with minimum pain at each stage, taught to yield to 
an object of the appropriate shape.   In this process the vaginal 
muscles come under better conscious control by the girl. She learns 
how to relax them to <accept>- instead of contracting them to <repel> 
the entering object.   Apart from the standard problem of 
controlling the vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that 
need special gynecological treatment. It is far better to have such 
conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon 
where they can create a really serious situation.   When no 
medical problems exist, the newly married couple generally prefer to 
cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves. Special 
information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still 
of great value. Folk-lore, superstition and remembered passages from 
erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly 
taken as scientific facts and useful hints. ##

<The importance 
of loving tenderness is obvious. The long, unhurried approach and 
the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels. Under 
the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes 
and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases, providing an excellent 
lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration>.   Extensive 
observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established 
the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall 
(the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back) may cause 
a great deal of distress in a virgin. <But> during the same examination, 
<two> fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall (the 
bottom of the vagina in the same position) without any pain; and in 
fact without any difficulty <if the pressure is kept downward at all 
times>.   These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may 
be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse. The husband 
and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in 
mind. They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too 
much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina; at 
least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer 
a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.   In 
fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely 
adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.

Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing 
the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration. 
The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain 
while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased 
with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling 
the problem once and for all.   <Such talk is seriously in error. 
Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride, 
both physically and psychologically. The insistent, forceful penetration 
may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage 
to the hymen>.   <The pain and distress associated with 
the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital 
relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the sex act unpleasant 
and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate 
his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it>. ## 

Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in 
the honeymoon situation. The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's 
hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous
