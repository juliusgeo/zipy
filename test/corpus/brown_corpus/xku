a great newspaper, the New York Times, on the occasion of a major change 
in its top executive command.   Arthur Hays Sulzberger has 
been a distinguished publisher of this distinguished newspaper and 
it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution to American 
journalism on the occasion of his retirement. I am pleased to 
note that Mr& Sulzberger will continue to serve as chairman of the 
board of the New York Times.   Mr& Sulzberger's successor 
as publisher is Mr& Orvil E& Dryfoos, who is president of the 
New York Times Co&, and who has been with the Times since 1942. 
Mr& Dryfoos' outstanding career as a journalist guarantees that 
the high standards which have made the Times one of the world's 
great newspapers will be maintained.   I am also pleased to note 
that Mr& John B& Oakes, a member of the Times staff since 1946, 
has been appointed as editorial page editor. Mr& Oakes succeeds 
Charles Merz, editor since 1938, who now becomes editor emeritus.

I should like at this time, Mr& Speaker, to pay warm tribute 
to Arthur Hays Sulzberger and Charles Merz on the occasion of 
their retirement from distinguished careers in American journalism.

My heartiest congratulations go to their successors, Orvil E& 
Dryfoos and John B& Oakes, who can be counted upon to sustain 
the illustrious tradition of the New York Times.   The people 
of the 17th District of New York, and I as their Representative 
in Congress, take great pride in the New York Times as one of the 
great and authoritative newspapers of the world. 
_MR& STRATTON._ Mr& Speaker, in my latest newsletter to my constituents 
I urged the imposition of a naval blockade of Cuba as the 
only effective method of preventing continued Soviet armaments from 
coming into the Western Hemisphere in violation of the Monroe Doctrine. 
Yesterday, I had the privilege of reading a thoughtful article 
in the U&S& News + World Report of May 8 which discussed this 
type of action in more detail, including both its advantages and its 
disadvantages.   Under leave to extend my remarks, I include 
the relevant portion of my newsletter, together with the text of the 
article from the U&S& News + World Report: "_YOUR CONGRESSMAN, 
SAMUEL S& STRATTON, REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1961_ 
Cuban S&S&R&: Whatever may have been the setbacks resulting 
from the unsuccessful attempt of the Cuban rebels to establish 
a beachhead on the Castro-held mainland last week, there was at least 
one positive benefit, and that was the clear-cut revelation to the 
whole world of the complete conversion of Cuba into a Russian-dominated 
military base.   In fact, one of the major reasons for the 
failure of the ill-starred expedition appears to have been a lack of full 
information on the extent to which Cuba has been getting this Russian 
military equipment. Somehow, the pictures and stories of Soviet 
~T-34 tanks on Cuban beaches and Russian Mig jet fighters strafing 
rebel troops has brought home to all of us the stark, blunt truth 
of what it means to have a Russian military base 90 miles away from 
home. Russian tanks and planes in Cuba jeopardize the security of 
the United States, violate the Monroe Doctrine, and threaten the 
security of every other Latin American republic.   Once the full 
extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear, President 
Kennedy announced we would take whatever action was appropriate 
to prevent this, even if we had to go it alone. But the Latin American 
republics who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on 
taking action against Castro also reacted swiftly last week by finally 
throwing Cuba off the Inter-American Defense Board. For years 
the United States had been trying to get these countries to exclude 
Castro's representative from secret military talks. But it took the 
pictures of the Migs and the ~T-34 tanks to do the job. There 
is a new atmosphere of urgency in Washington this week. You can see 
it, for example, in the extensive efforts President Kennedy has made 
to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba 
and Laos; efforts, 
as I see it, which are being directed, by the way, toward 
support for future actions, not for those already past.   What 
the next move will be only time, of course, will tell. Personally, 
I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of Cuba. We 
simply can't tolerate further Russian weapons, including the possibility 
of long-range nuclear missiles, being located in Cuba. Obviously, 
we can't stop them from coming in, however, just by talk. A naval 
blockade would be thoroughly in line with the Monroe Doctrine, would 
be a relatively simple operation to carry out, and would bring an 
abrupt end to Soviet penetration of our hemisphere". @ "#[FROM

_NEXT FOR CUBA: 
AN ARMS BLOCKADE?_ Look at Castro now- cockier than ever 
with arms and agents to threaten the Americas.   How can the 
United States act?   Blockade is one answer offered by experts. 
In it they see a way to isolate Cuba, stop infiltration, maybe finish 
Castro, too.   This is the question now facing President 
Kennedy: How to put a stop to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to 
Communist infiltration of this hemisphere?   On April 25, the 
White House reported that a total embargo of remaining U&S& 
trade with Cuba was being considered. Its aim: To undermine further 
Cuba's economy. weaken Castro.   Another strategy- bolder 
and tougher- was also attracting notice in Washington: a naval 
and air blockade to cut Cuba off from the world, destroy Castro.

Blockade, in the view of military and civilian experts, could restore 
teeth to the Monroe Doctrine. It could halt a flood of Communist 
arms and strategic supplies now reaching Castro. It could stop 
Cuban re-export of guns and propaganda materials to South America. 
It would be the most severe reprisal, short of declared war, that the 
United States could invoke against Castro.   It is the strategy 
of blockade, therefore, that is suddenly at the center of attention 
of administration officials, Members of Congress, officers in the 
Pentagon. As a possible course of action, it also is the center of 
debate and is raising many questions. Among these questions: _WHAT 
WOULD 
A CUBA BLOCKADE TAKE?_ Military experts say a tight naval blockade 
off Cuban ports and at the approaches to Cuban waters would require 
two naval task forces, each built around an aircraft carrier with 
a complement of about 100 planes and several destroyers.   The 
Navy, on April 25, announced it is bringing back the carrier <Shangri-La> 
from the Mediterranean, increasing to four the number of 
attack carriers in the vicinity of Cuba. More than 36 other big Navy 
ships are no less than a day's sailing time away.   To round 
out the blockading force, submarines would be needed- to locate, identify 
and track approaching vessels. Land-based radar would help with 
this task. So would radar picket ships. A squadron of Navy jets and 
another of long-range patrol planes would add support to the carrier 
task forces.   Three requirements go with a blockade: It must 
be proclaimed; the blockading force must be powerful enough to enforce 
it; and it must be enforced without discrimination.   Once 
these conditions of international law are met, countries that try to 
run to blockade do so at their own risk. Blockade runners can be stopped- 
by gunfire, if necessary- searched and held, at least temporarily. 
They could be sent to U&S& ports for rulings whether cargo 
should be confiscated. _WHAT COULD A BLOCKADE ACCOMPLISH?_ Plenty, 
say the experts. In a broad sense, it would reaffirm the Monroe 
Doctrine by opposing Communist interference in the Western Hemisphere. 
It could, by avoiding direct intervention, provide a short-of-war 
strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration.   Primary target 
would be shipments of tanks, guns, aviation gasoline and ammunition 
coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia. Shipments of arms from Western 
countries could similarly be seized as contraband. In a total blockade, 
action could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals, 
oils, textiles, and even foodstuffs. At times, three ships a day from 
the Soviet bloc are unloading in Cuban ports. 
From its inception in 1920 with the passage of Public Law 236, 66th 
Congress, the purpose of the vocational rehabilitation program has been 
to assist the States, by means of grants-in-aid, to return disabled 
men and women to productive, gainful employment. The authority for 
the program was renewed several times until the vocational rehabilitation 
program was made permanent as Title /5, of the Social Security 
Act in 1935. Up to this time and for the next eight years, the services 
provided disabled persons consisted mainly of training, counseling, 
and placement on a job. Recognizing the limitations of such a program, 
the 78th Congress in 1943 passed P& L& 113, which broadened 
the concept of rehabilitation to include the provision of physical 
restoration services to remove or reduce disabilities, and which revised 
the financing structure. _RECENT CHANGES._ Despite the successful 
rehabilitation of over a half million disabled persons in the first 
eleven years after 1943, the existing program was still seen to be 
inadequate to cope with the nation's backlog of an estimated two million 
disabled. To assist the States, therefore, in rehabilitating handicapped 
individuals, "so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative 
employment to the extent of their capabilities", the 83rd 
Congress enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 
(P& L& 565). These amendments to the Vocational Rehabilitation 
Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation 
facilities, for more sheltered and "half-way" workshops, for 
greater numbers of adequately trained personnel, for more comprehensive 
services to individuals (particularly to the homebound and the blind), 
and for other administrative improvements to increase the program's 
overall effectiveness. _FINANCIAL ASPECTS._ Under the law as it 
existed until 1943, the Federal Government made grants to the States 
on the basis of population, matching State expenditures on a 50-50 
basis. Under P& L& 113, 78th Congress, the Federal Government 
assumed responsibility for 100% of necessary State expenditures 
in connection with administration and the counseling and placement of 
the disabled, and for 50% of the necessary costs of providing clients 
with rehabilitation case services. Throughout these years, the statutory 
authorization was for such sums as were necessary to carry out 
the provisions of the Act.   The 1954 Amendments completely changed 
the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program, providing 
for a three-part grant structure- for (1) basic support; (2) extension 
and improvement; and (3) research, demonstrations, training and 
traineeships for vocational rehabilitation- and in addition for 
short-term training and instruction. The first part of the new structure- 
that for supporting the basic program of vocational rehabilitation 
services- is described in this Section. Subsequent sections 
on grants describe the other categories of the grant structure.

The following table shows, for selected years, the authorizations, 
appropriations, allotment base, Federal grants to States and State 
matching funds for this part of the grant program: 

#METHOD OF 
DISTRIBUTING FUNDS#

_DESCRIPTION OF FORMULA._ In order to assist 
the States in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation services, Section 
2 of the amended Act provides that allotments to States for 
support of such services be based on (1) need, as measured by a State's 
population, and (2) fiscal capacity, as measured by its per capita 
income. The Act further provides for a "floor" or minimum allotment, 
set at the 1954 level, which is called the "base" allotment, 
and a "ceiling" or maximum allotment, for each State. It stipulates, 
in addition, that all amounts remaining as a result of imposing 
the "ceiling", 
and not used for insuring the "floor", be redistributed 
to those States still below their maximums. These provisions 
are designed to reflect the differences in wealth and population among 
the States, with the objective that a vocationally handicapped person 
have access to needed services regardless of whether he resides in 
a State with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly
