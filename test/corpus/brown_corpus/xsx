The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from 
a woman who was equally indefinite. "What have you got on today"? 
she inquired. "A blue suit", he answered. "Who's in it"? 
she continued. "I am", he said. There was a short pause for 
reflection. "Oh", said the woman, "I've seen that picture 
already".

Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of 
the use of the <double verb>. When a question contains two verbs, the 
response does not make clear which of them is being answered.

The moonlit night was made for romance, and he had been looking at 
her soulfully for some time. Finally he asked, "Do you object to petting"? 
"That's one thing I've never done", she said promptly. 
He thought a moment, then inquired, "You mean petted"? 
"No", she smiled, "objected".   Replies to requests for 
character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre. 
It would be hard to find anything more equivocal than: "I cannot 
recommend him too highly".   Another less ambiguous case read 
as follows: "The bearer of this letter has served me for two years 
to his complete satisfaction. If you are thinking of giving him a 
berth, be sure to make it a wide one".   In the comedy of indefinite 
reference, <it-wit> occupies a prominent place because of its 
frequent occurrence. Ambiguity arises when the pronoun <it> carries 
a twofold reference.   Two friends were talking. One said, "When 
I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it, and within a 
few hours it's gone". The speaker referred to the whiskey but his 
friend thought he meant the cold.   It-wit is a misnomer because 
it covers slips as well as wit. An excited woman was making an emergency 
call over the phone: "Doctor, please come over right away. My 
husband is in great pain.

I CALLED the other afternoon on my old friend, Graves Moreland, 
the Anglo-American literary critic- his mother was born in 
Ohio- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson Downs, 
raising hell and peacocks, the former only when the venerable gentleman 
becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something 
else that is dwindling and diminishing, such as human stature, hope, 
and humor.   My unscientific friend does not believe that human 
stature is measurable in terms of speed, momentum, weightlessness, or 
distance from earth, but is a matter of the development of the human 
mind. After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World, for a 
nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism, 
Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said: "I am not interested 
in how long a bee can live in a vacuum, or how far it can fly. A 
bee's place is in the hive".   "I have come to talk with 
you about the future of humor and comedy", I told him, at which he 
started slightly, and then made us each a stiff drink, with a trembling 
hand.   "I seem to remember", he said, "that in an interview 
ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live. Did 
you go to their funeral"?   "I was wrong", I admitted. 
"Comedy didn't die, it just went crazy. It has identified itself 
with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate. We 
now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace 
but we also have horror jokes, magazines known as Horror Comics, 
and sick comedians. There are even publications called <Sick> and 
<Mad>. The <Zeitgeist> is not crazy as a loon or mad as a March 
hare; it is manic as a man".   "I woke up this morning", 
Moreland said, "paraphrasing Lewis Carroll. Do you want to hear 
the paraphrase"?   "Can I bear it"? I asked, taking 
a final gulp of my drink, and handing him the empty glass. 
"Just barely", he said, and repeated his paraphrase: "The 
time has come", the walrus said, "To speak of manic things, 
Of shots and shouts, and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings".

Moreland fixed us each another drink, and said, "For 
God's sake, tell me something truly amusing".   "I'll 
try", I said, and sat for a moment thinking. "Oh yes, the other 
day I reread some of Emerson's <English Traits,> and there 
was an anecdote about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany, 
more than a hundred years ago. In the railway station at Berlin, 
a uniformed attendant was chanting, 'Foreigners this way! Foreigners 
this way'! One woman- she could have been either English 
or American- went up to him and said, 'But <you> are the foreigners'". 
I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my 
drink, and said, "I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson 
for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy".

"What's the matter with the music"? Moreland 
asked.   "It doesn't drown out the dialogue", I explained.

"Let's talk about books", Moreland said. "I am told 
that in America you have non-books by non-writers, brought out by 
non-publishers for non-readers. Is it all non-fiction"?   "There 
is non-fiction and non non-fiction", I said. "Speaking 
of nonism: the other day, in a story about a sit-down demonstration, 
the Paris <Herald Tribune> wrote, 'The non-violence became noisier'. 
And then Eichmann was quoted as saying, in non-English, that 
Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews was nonsense". 
"If we cannot tell evil, horror, and insanity from nonsense, what is 
the future of humor and comedy"? Moreland asked, grimly. 
"Cryptic", I said. "They require, for existence, a brave spirit 
and a high heart, and where do you find these? In our present era 
of Science and <Angst,> the heart has been downgraded, to use one 
of our popular retrogressive verbs".   "I know what you mean", 
Moreland sighed. "Last year your Tennessee Williams told 
our Dilys Powell, in a television program, that it is the task of the 
playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart. 
Like almost everybody else, he confused the heart, both as organ and 
as symbol, with the disturbed psyche, the deranged glands, and the jumpy 
central nervous system. I'm not pleading for the heart that leaps 
up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky, or for the heart that with 
rapture fills and dances with the daffodils. The sentimental pure heart 
of Galahad is gone with the knightly years, but I still believe 
in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the 
stuff that breaks".   "We no longer have Tom Moore's 
and Longfellow's 'heart for any fate', either", I said.

"Moore and Longfellow didn't have the fate that faces us", Moreland 
said. "One day our species promises co-existence, and the next 
day it threatens co-extinction". We sat for a while drinking in 
silence.   "The heart", I said finally, "is now either in 
the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes. When it was worn 
in the breast, or even on the sleeve, we at least knew where it was". 
There was a long silence.   "You have visited England five 
times in the past quarter-century, I believe", my host said. "What 
has impressed you most on your present visit"?   "I 
would say depressed, not impressed", I told him. "I should say it 
is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas, 
involving clergymen and parishioners, psychiatrists and patients. 
It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas 
from the modern theatre".   "Do you think we need a new 
Henry James to re-explore the Anglo-American scene"? he asked. 
"Or perhaps a new Noe^l Coward"?   "But you must have 
heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent 
years of James and the antic heyday of Coward. I myself hear 
it said constantly- in drawing-rooms. In them, there is usually 
a group of Anglo-Americans with tragicomic problems, worthy of being 
explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire". 
I stood up and began pacing.   "If you are trying to get 
us out of the brothel, the dustbin, the kitchen sink, and the tawdry living-room, 
you are probably wasting your time", Moreland told me. 
"Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that 
crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock".   "Furiouser 
and furiouser", I said. "I am worried about the current 
meanings of the word 'funny'. It now means ominous, as when one speaks 
of a funny sound in the motor; disturbing, as when one says that 
a friend is acting funny; and frightening, as when a wife tells 
the police that it is funny, but her husband hasn't been home for two 
days and nights".   Moreland sat brooding for a full minute, 
during which I made each of us a new drink. He took his glass, clinked 
it against mine, and said, <"Toujours gai,> what the hell"! 
borrowing a line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel.   "Be careful 
of the word 'gay', for it, too, has undergone a change. It 
now means, in my country, homosexual", I said. "Oh, I forgot to 
say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon, he is 
removed to a mental institution in an ambulance. Recently, by the way, 
I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I 
was non-institutionalized". ##

MY HOST went over and stared 
out the window at his peacocks; then he turned to me. "Is 
it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species"?

"Oh, that is demonstrable", I told him. "Do 
you remember the woman in the French Alps who was all alone with her 
sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously? She told the sheep, 
'The world is coming to an end'! And the sheep said- all 
in unison, I have no doubt- 'Ba-a-a'! The sound mockery of 
sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh".   "That is only partly 
non-nonsense", he began.   "If you saw the drama called 
<Rhinoceros",> I said, "think of the effect it would have on 
an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning 
into a rhinoceros. The rhinos would panic, screaming 'Help'!- 
if that can be screamed in their language".   "You think 
the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy"? Moreland demanded.

"Non-God, no", I said. "The political and intellectual 
Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago, because they fear 
things they do not understand and cannot manage, such as satire and 
irony, such as 
humor and comedy. Nevertheless, like any other human being 
upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually, Khrushchev, 
the anti-personality cultist, has become a comic actor, or thinks 
he has. In his famous meeting with Nixon a couple of years ago he seemed 
to believe that he was as funny as Ed Wynn. But, like Caesar, 
he has only one joke, so far as I can find out. It consists in saying, 
'That would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage'. Why 
in the name of his non-God doesn't he vary it a bit"?

"Such as"? Moreland asked.   "Such as 'sending the 
cat to guard the mice', or 'the falcon to protect the dove', or 
most terribly sharp of all, 'the human being to save humanity'".

"You and I have fallen out of literature into politics", 
Moreland observed.   "What a nasty fall was there"! I 
said.   Moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again, and then 
came back and sat down, restively. "The world that was once foot-loose 
and fancy-free", he said, "has now become screw-loose and 
frenzy-free. In our age of Science and <Angst> it seems to me more 
brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the 
sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space".   "The human 
ego being what it is", I put in, "science fiction has always assumed 
that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems 
than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats. It seems 
to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may 
well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species". 
"Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again", Moreland protested.

"Not in the largest sense of the words", I said.
