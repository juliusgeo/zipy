head.   The shot reverberated in diminishing whiplashes of sound. 
Hush followed. Like a mischievous boy expecting punishment, Matsuo 
awaited reaction from the jungle. How stupid to give his position 
away.   The jungle did not retort. The sitter remained seated 
hugging the tree. Before long the atmosphere reverted to its old normalcy, 
and insects hummed and birds occasionally called. Matsuo puzzled 
and grew anxious over the complete passiveness, concluding that he 
was the butt of a devilish joke.   Five or so minutes later the 
marine abruptly pulled up and stepped into sunlight, immediately throwing 
his hands over his eyes. He went into a whirling dance, a sort of 
blind chasing of the tail. It ended when he tumbled; but jumping right 
up, he staggered in no particular direction. He wore no head cover 
of any kind and, more odd, had no visible weapon.   With a sudden 
decisiveness he lurched in Matsuo's direction, crossing the meadow 
in a zigzagging gallop. When he got closer to the tree, Matsuo 
noted the wild look on his face. The pockets of his jacket bulged. Hand 
grenades.   the bobbing head was a poor target, so Matsuo shot 
him in the upper trunk.   The marine spun, clapping a hand high 
on his chest, and dived forward. In the hush that followed the echoes, 
Matsuo was tense. They could come on him now without difficulty. 
Gradually he reached a conclusion. The marine was alone, for they 
were impatient people and by now would have vied to knock him from 
the tree.   Down the tree he scrambled and knelt at the edge of 
foliage. The marine was sprawled some thirty yards away, one arm extended. 
Matsuo jumped when the hidden arm flopped out. Reflex?

Rifle leveled on the man, he made a rush. Heat, in the sunlight, pressed 
in like an invisible crowd.   He squatted by the head, gently 
placing the rifle 
on the ground. With a snakestrike motion he grasped the 
hair, and, twisting, pulled the marine over on his back. He was bearded. 
The bullet had penetrated in the area of the right collarbone; 
around the hole, blood glistened in a little patch. Maintaining his 
clutch on the hair, Matsuo watched the closed eyes while rummaging in 
the jacket pockets. In one: a package of cigarettes and a tinplated 
lighter, both sticky from the man's bleeding. In the other: a 
wristwatch with broken crystal wrapped in a dirty handkerchief. One 
by one he tossed the objects aside. He didn't smoke and could not light 
fires with a flintless lighter; he had no use any longer for exact 
time, even had the watch been running. Then there was no saying how 
many times the marine had blown his nose on the handkerchief.

Too bad the marine had no water. From its holder he took his own canteen. 
The cap was stuck and made a thin rusty squeaking as he applied 
pressure. The marine's eyes opened, squeezed shut, then opened squinted 
in the glare.   So, alive. Matsuo put the bottle to his 
own lips. The marine reached up a hand. Matsuo shook his head. "None 
for you". The marine blinked, soon dropping his hand. Not only 
had he no canteen, but he lacked even the belt to hang one on. "You 
came well equipped to die".   Some odor made him lean over 
the man. He sniffed and recognized it. <Sake>. So that had been his 
difficulty. Drunk on <sake>, he must have wandered off from his 
bivouac.   The marine tried to roll on his right side, and moaned. 
When he rolled on the left side, propping on his left elbow, Matsuo 
seized his hair and pulled him back over. "Be a good turtle".

Awkwardly with one hand Matsuo got the cap back on the water 
bottle. The smell of <sake> had freshened yesterday's events in his 
thoughts. In the caves, with other supplies, they had kept cases of 
<sake>.   The marine shut his eyes. "Are you a thrower of 
flame, marine"? Matsuo took the small knife from its scabbard and 
laid it on the ground, out of the marine's reach and away from their 
shadows. He waited in his squat, gripping the hair.   Every 
so often he turned the knife. Its blade was dazzling in the intense sunlight. 
The sun was noon high and Matsuo perspired until his body was 
dripping. Wet also were the marine's fatigues and the face had an 
oily film. The man had thrown the left hand over his eyes. Now and 
again he murmured something that ended in a giggle. He must have saturated 
himself in the drink, for the bullet not to shock him out of his 
drunken haze. Matsuo shook his head. Strange.   At last he reached 
for the knife. Even the bone handle scorched, and he retrieved 
the marine's handkerchief to wrap it. First he barely touched the 
blade on the hand which shaded the eyes. The marine yelled and flung 
the hand away. With a firm grip on the man's hair Matsuo applied the 
blade flat on a cheek. A shrill yelp, kicked legs, and groping hands 
that circled Matsuo's wrist. Matsuo wrenched free and burned the 
hands into retreat; burned the other cheek; burned each hand when 
they came groping again. The marine commenced to weep and it blighted 
the sense of enjoyment.   Matsuo stood up. "A small measure 
of payment, marine". He dropped the knife in its scabbard, hung the 
rifle behind a shoulder.   The marine, hands on cheeks, rolled 
by his unwounded side onto his stomach. He ceased weeping.   Matsuo 
walked toward his tree, once glancing back. The marine was still. 
He would soon die.   As Matsuo climbed by using the vines 
and kicking his feet against the trunk, a mood of gloom immersed him like 
a jungle shadow. What now? In the jungle, birds were mute, while 
insects preserved only the monotony of living.   Someone called. 
It was the marine: head lifted, he strained and called. Then he 
astonished Matsuo by pushing and dragging himself until he sat. He 
cupped his mouth and yelled. Matsuo hustled the rifle off his shoulder. 
Once and for all he'd finish this marine who would not die. He 
aimed, but listened. It sounded as if the man were calling him: "Hey, 
Japanese **h hey there, Japanese". The man tilted back his 
head and went through the pantomime of drinking from a container. He 
performed the act twice more, and the begging in his tone grew more distinct.

<"Sake"?> Matsuo called.   The marine nodded 
vigorously.   Matsuo laughed, slung the rifle. The marine 
was a winehead. His superiors had said that all marines were depraved.

The marine slumped forward into a bow like a priest before 
an idol. Remembering his own thirst, Matsuo took out his water bottle. 
One swallow was all he would have; he was very thirsty, but he must 
observe water discipline. His years of campaigning had taught him 
the value of water discipline.   He began to uncap the bottle, 
the rusty cap squealing on its threads. Popping upright, the marine waved 
both hands and shouted.   Of course it was water he really 
craved; down in the broil of the sun he was becoming dried out. The 
marine shouted for it until it seemed that his voice had to crack. Matsuo 
shook his head. He had no water for an enemy. And when this was 
gone, he hadn't even a little bitter tablet to purify other water 
if he were to discover some stagnant jungle pool.   He capped the 
bottle and replaced it. After all, he had less reason to desire it 
than the marine.   Before much longer the marine quieted down. His 
head slumped. The upper part of his packet had stained dark. "Marine. 
There is nothing for you", Matsuo said. "Your superiors 
will certainly beat you for your desertion, besides the dishonor of it. 
I've nothing for you".   From the convulsive quivers of 
the man's shoulders it was plain he had resumed the weeping. He reminded 
Matsuo of a similar thing he had witnessed in China. In China 
it was a baby sitting on a railroad platform, smudged, blood-specked, 
with the village burning about him and shells exploding.

CHAIRS SCRAPED BACK and customers hastily vacated their tables 
as the tall young buffalo hunter pushed open the swing doors and 
walked towards the bar. Only Blue Throat and his gang stayed where 
they were. Blue Throat was slumped with his back against the bar, elbows 
supporting his massive frame. He leered at the stranger as the 
distance between them closed.   "Since when did they allow beardless 
kids into the saloon bars of this town, boys"? he asked. "Seems 
to me I don't remember altering any law about that".

He straightened up, alert now as the buffalo hunter came closer. "Stay 
right here where you are, kid", he called. "I don't aim 
to have minors breathing down my neck when I'm a-drinking":

The stranger ignored him. He didn't stop till he was within three 
feet of Blue Throat and by that time the gang leader's right 
hand was on the butt of his revolver.   "I'm Billy Tilghman", 
said the stranger, "and I've come for Pat Conyers' body".

"And what makes you think you're going to get it, pretty 
boy"?   "Because I'm asking. Most of the time I get 
what I ask for".   Blue Throat winked at his six cronies. 
"The kid has no manners, boys. Shall we teach him some"? His 
gun was half drawn when he asked the question, but the weapon never 
left its holster. Tilghman's clenched fist swept over in a terrific 
right cross and clipped the big gunfighter on the side of his chin. His 
head snapped round and he reeled back, crashing into the table where 
his buddies were sprawling.   Tilghman leapt on to him, dragged 
him upright and hit him again, this time sending him careening against 
the bar. A bullet gouged into the bar top an inch from Tilghman's 
stomach as Blue Throat's henchmen started shooting. Tilghman 
flung himself aside, dropped on one knee and pulled his own gun.

The Colt roared twice and two men dropped, writhing. A third shot 
doused the light. Somewhere at the far end of the room a voice yelled, 
"You all right, Billy"?   "Yes, George, but I ain't 
got poor old Pat's body yet. And I aim to have it". He fired 
again, and somewhere in the gloom a man screamed. Another took off 
his gun belt and flung his weapons to the floor. "OK, Tilghman, 
I'm quitting".   "And me", said another Blue Throat 
henchman.   Somebody brought a light. Tilghman and his partner, 
George Rust, herded the men into a corner. "And now", said Tilghman 
with deadly calm, "I'll repeat what I said. I've come 
for Pat Conyers' body".   In two minutes the body of Tilghman's 
former comrade, who had been killed by Blue Throat in a gambling 
brawl the previous night, was carried into the town's funeral 
parlor to be prepared for decent burial. Blue Throat, nursing an aching 
jaw and a collosal dose of wounded pride, rode out of town with the 
survivors of the fight.   "That critter will be back tomorrow", 
predicted George Rust, "and he'll bring fifty of his kind 
back with him. Blue Throat won't stand for this. He'll shoot up 
the town".   The prediction was correct. The Reverend James 
Doran had scarcely completed Pat Conyers' last rites on Boot 
Hill in the township of Petrie, when shots were heard in the distance.

"Amen", said the Reverend Doran, grabbing his rifle propped 
up against a tombstone, "and now my brethren, it would seem that 
our presence is required elsewhere".   Billy Tilghman and 
his comrades rode off to the battle. Blue Throat, who had ruled the 
town with his six-shooter for the last six months, certainly had no intention 
of relinquishing his profitable dictatorship. It was essential 
that he should restore his formidable reputation as a rip-roaring, 
ruthless gun-slinger, and this was the time-honored Wild West method 
of doing it.   He rode in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and 
liquor-crazed desperadoes and took over a livery barn at the entrance 
to Main Street. The entire length of the street could be raked with 
rifle fire from this barn. Any posse riding down the street to demand 
Blue Throat's surrender would be wiped out with one deadly burst 
of fire.   The law-abiding citizens of Petrie had gathered 
inside Kaster's Store, halfway down the street. Several were firing 
into the barn when Billy Tilghman arrived. He sized up the situation 
and shook his head.   "If Blue Throat has his way he'll 
keep us all cooped up in here for days", he said. "There's only 
one thing to move him fast, and we have it right here in this very 
store".   He called the store owner and together they went into 
the stockroom. Billy returned with six sticks of dynamite. "I'm 
gonna drop these into Blue Throat's lap", he announced, "and 
I'd like every gun to be firing into that barn while I get near
