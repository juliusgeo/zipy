his forehead, behind the tirades and the sulky silences, the passionate 
orations and the occasional dull evasive stare, behind the prejudices, 
the cynicism, the total amorality of behavior, behind even the tendency 
to great strategic mistakes, there lay a statesman of no mean qualities: 
Shrewd, calculating, in many ways realistic, endowed- like 
Stalin- with considerable powers of dissimulation, capable of playing 
his cards very close to his chest when he so desired, yet bold and 
resolute in his decisions, and possessing one gift Stalin did not 
possess: The ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion 
and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word".   Two criticisms 
of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment 
of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges- there is 
no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan. And 
in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary 
world, one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come 
to grips with the baffling riddle of our time: How to deal with 
a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.

But one should not ask for everything. Mr& Kennan, who has recently 
abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently 
appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia, is not the only man who 
finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future. 
The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-Western relations 
is vitally important, and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical 
narrator. 
The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter 
political 
or domestic unrest, lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit 
and charm. In "Donnybrook", there is quite a different Eire, a 
rural land where singing, dancing, fist-fighting and romancing are the 
thing. There is plenty of violence, to be sure, but it is a nice violence 
and no one gets killed. By and large, Robert McEnroe's adaptation 
of Maurice Walsh's film, "The Quiet Man", provides 
the entertainment it set out to, and we have a lively musical show if 
not a superlative one. _@_ This is the tale of one John Enright, 
an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring 
and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become 
a quiet man. But Innesfree, where Ellen Roe Danaher and her 
bullying brother, Will, live, is no place for a man who will not use 
his fists. So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded 
considerably, thereby providing the tale which is told. You may be 
sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with 
the brother, and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way 
to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means. 
Then there is a matchmaker, one Mikeen Flynn, a role for which Eddie 
Foy was happily selected. Now there is no reason in the world why 
a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe 
dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs, torso and neck, 
except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play. 
Mr& Foy is a joy, having learned his dancing by practicing it 
until he is practically perfect. His matchmaking is, naturally, incidental, 
and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes 
him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.   Art Lund, a fine 
big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice, impersonates 
Enright. Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic 
technique, that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have, 
anyway. Joan Fagan, a fiery redhead who can impress you that she 
has a temper whether she really has one or not, plays Ellen, and sings 
the role very well, too. If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has 
a bit of theatrical dross in it, never mind; she fits into the general 
scheme well enough.   Susan Johnson, as the widow, spends the 
first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented 
death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new 
one. She has a good, firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues 
of the evening.   Then there are a pair of old biddies played 
by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf 
of stock Irish characters, but they put such a combination of good 
will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining. 
And in the role of Will Danaher, Philip Bosco roars and sneers 
sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British 
army, if he chose.   "Donnybrook" is no "Brigadoon", 
but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some 
excellent dancing. The ballads are sweet and sad, and the music generally 
competent. It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after 
the final curtain, and some of it, such as the catchy "Sez I", 
does. "A Toast To The Bride", sung by Clarence Nordstrom, playing 
a character called Old Man Toomey, is quite simple, direct and 
touching.   The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in 
cloth caps and sweaters, and their dancing and singing is fine. So is 
that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep 
under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction. The male dancers 
sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and 
stimulating.   Rouben Ter-Arutunian, in his stage settings, 
often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr& Cole has placed couples 
or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow. 
There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty 
good time at "Donnybrook", unless they are permanently in the 
mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable 
Irish.

WE can all breathe more easily this morning- more easily 
and joyously, too- because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show, 
"Fanny", into a delightful and heart-warming film.   The 
task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio 
of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting 
them again on the screen, after their passage through the Broadway 
musical idiom, was a delicate and perilous one, indeed. More than 
the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star, the great 
Raimu, were looking askance at the project. The fans of the musical 
were, too.   But now the task is completed and the uncertainty 
resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music 
Hall yesterday. Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether 
partial to music or no, you can't help but derive joy from this 
picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.

SOME of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in 
the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow. 
A tiny handful never did make the concert. But, after a fifteen-minute 
delay, the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage 
for the afternoon's proceedings. They faced a rather small audience, 
as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures 
of the afternoon.   It was an excellent concert. Paul 
Paray, rounding out his current stint with the orchestra, is a solid 
musician, and the Philharmonic plays for him. Their collaboration in 
the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid, intelligent and natural sounding. 
It was not a heavy, ponderous Beethoven. The music sang nicely, 
sprinted evenly when necessary, was properly accented and balanced.

 The Franck symphonic poem, "Psyche", is a 
lush, 
sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again. Fortunate 
for the music itself, it is not too frequent a visitor; if 
it were, its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying.

Mr& Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic 
elements of the score. He did not let the strings, for instance, 
weep, whine or get hysterical. His interpretation was a model of refinement 
and accuracy.   And in the Prokofieff ~C major Piano 
Concerto, with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist, he was an admirable partner. 
Mr& Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold, sweeping 
and tonally percussive. He swept through the music with ease, in a 
non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner. #@#

An impressive technician, 
Mr& Skolovsky has fine rhythm, to boot. His tone is the 
weakest part of his equipment; it tends to be hard and colorless. 
A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this 
concerto needs. It is, after all, a non-romantic work (even with the 
big, juicy melody of the second movement); and the composer himself 
was called the "age of steel pianist". But granted all this, one 
still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than 
Mr& Skolovsky supplied.   Taken as a whole, though, it was 
a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra. Mr& Skolovsky 
fully deserved the warm reception he received.   A new work on 
the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's "Festival Overture", 
receiving its first New York hearing. This was composed last year as 
a salute to the automobile industry. It is not program music, though. 
It runs a little more than ten minutes, is workmanlike, busy, methodical 
and featureless.

"La Gioconda", like it or not, is a singer's opera. And 
so, of course, it is a fan's opera as well. Snow or no, the fans 
were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance 
of the Ponchielli work.   So the plot creaks, the sets 
are decaying, the costumes are pre-historic, the orchestra was sloppy 
and not very well connected with what the singers were doing. After 
all, the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed, 
with no less than six leading parts.   One of those parts 
is that of evil, evil Barnaba, the spy. His wicked deeds were carried 
on by Anselmo Colzani, who was taking the part for the first time 
with the company.   He has the temperament and the stage presence 
for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone. 
What was lacking was a real sense of phrase, the kind of legato singing 
that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is, after 
all, a very oily character.   Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare 
Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast, but only with respect 
to this season; they have both sung these parts here before. Laura 
is a good role for Miss Resnik, and she gave it force, dramatic color 
and passion.   Mr& Siepi was, as always, a consummate actor; 
with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently. 
Part of this characterization was, of course, accomplished with the 
vocal chords. His singing was strong and musical; unfortunately his 
voice was out of focus and often spread in quality.   Eileen Farrell 
in the title role, Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker 
as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season, and 
all contributed to a vigorous performance. If only they and Fausto 
Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more. @

"MELODIOUS birds sing madrigals" saith the poet and no 
better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could 
be imagined.   Their Vanguard album {Madrigal Masterpieces} 
(~BG 609; stereo ~BGS 5031) is a good sample of the special, 
elegant art of English madrigal singing. It also makes a fine introduction 
to the international art form with good examples of Italian 
and English madrigals plus several French "chansons". 
The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better 
than anyone else. The original impulses came to England late (in the 
sixteenth century) and continue strong long after everyone else had 
gone on to the baroque basso continuo, sonatas, operas and the like.

Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian 
interregnum, the practice of singing together- choruses, catches 
and glees- always flourished. The English never again developed 
a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier 
great age the way, say, the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian 
madrigal.
