for the nursery, however. It seemed unlikely that her crew, if either 
of them were alive, could even see the <Ariadne>, for they were passing 
her at a distance of nearly a light-year. And there would be no 
chance of signaling them- without the Nernst generator Jack could 
not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static, and by 
the time he could rebuild his fusion power the skiff would be gone.

Fuming, helpless, he watched them pass him. The sail, ragged 
though it was, still had enough surface to catch some of the ocean of 
power being poured out from the nursery stars. He would never have believed, 
without seeing it, that the bizarre little vessel could go so 
fast.   But where was it going? And why was it causing so much 
agitation among the Angels, and being followed by so many of them?

There was only one possible answer, but Jack's horrified 
mind refused to believe it until he had fed the radar plots of the skiff's 
course into the computer. The curve on the card the computer 
spat back at him couldn't be argued with, however.   The skiff 
was headed for the very center of the nebula- toward that place which, 
Jack knew now, could hold nothing less important than the very core 
of the Angel's life and religion.   It was clear that Langer 
had at last found a way to attract the Angel's attention.

It was equally clear that as of this moment, the treaty was off.

LANGER WOULD HAVE to be headed off, whether 
he knew where he was going or not. Almost surely he did; after all, 
he had had the same set of facts as Jack had had to work from, and 
he was an almost frighteningly observant man. But not having talked 
to the Angels, he had made a wrong turn in his reasoning somewhere along 
the line. Had he decided, perhaps, that the center of the cloud 
was 
a center of government, instead of a center of life and faith"?

But it didn't matter now whether he meant to invade the Holy 
of Holies, or was simply headed in that direction by accident. If 
it was intentional, it was now also unnecessary; and whether intentional 
or not, the outcome would be disastrous.   Jack crawled under 
the boards and restored the six feet of lead line he had excised from 
the Nernst generator switch. When he was back on his feet again 
and about to reinstall the fuses, however, he hesitated.   He had 
to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff, and he had to have 
it fast. But fusion power in the Coal Sack was what had triggered 
all the trouble in the first place- and he already had an Angel aboard.

"Hesperus"?   "Receiving".   "I'm 
going to turn my generator back on, as I promised to do. But I can't 
take you to Earth yet. First I've got to intercept my brothers 
before they get any deeper into trouble. Will you obstruct this, 
or will you help? I know it's not part of the bargain, and your 
elders might not like it".   "Nobody else can live in your 
hearth while I am in it", Hesperus said promptly. "As for my elders, 
they have already admitted that they were wrong. If because of 
this incident they become angry with Earth, I will not be permitted 
to go there at all. Therefore of course I will help".   With 
a short-lived sigh of relief, Jack plugged the fuses back in and threw 
the switch. Without an instant's transition, the green light that 
meant full fusion power winked on the board. Always before, it had 
taken five minutes to-   Of course. Hesperus was in there. From 
here on out, the <Ariadne> was going to be hotter than any space 
cruiser man had ever dreamed of.   But since he had failed to 
anticipate it, he lost the five minutes anyhow, in plotting an intercept 
orbit.   "Hesperus, don't use this ~<t-tau> vector 
trick of yours, please.

Ryan hefted his bulk up and supported it on one elbow. He rubbed 
his eyes sleepily with one huge paw. "Ekstrohm, Nogol, you guys 
okay"?   "Nothing wrong with me that couldn't be cured", 
Nogol said. He didn't say what would cure him; he had been 
explaining all during the trip what he needed to make him feel like himself. 
His small black eyes darted inside the olive oval of his face.

"Ekstrohm"? Ryan insisted.   "Okay". 
"Well, let's 
take a ground-level look at the country around here".

The facsiport rolled open on the landscape. A range of bluffs 
hugged the horizon, the color of decaying moss. Above them, the sky 
was the black of space, or the almost equal black of the winter sky above 
Minneapolis, seen against neon-lit snow. That cold, empty sky was 
full of fire and light. It seemed almost a magnification of the Galaxy 
itself, of the Milky Way, blown up by some master photographer.

This fiery swath was actually only a belt of minor planets, 
almost like the asteroid belt in the original Solar System. These 
planets were much bigger, nearly all capable of holding an atmosphere. 
But to the infuriation of scientists, for no known reason not all of 
them did. This would be the fifth mapping expedition to the planetoids 
of Yancy-6 in three generations. They lay months away from the nearest 
Earth star by jump drive, and no one knew what they were good for, 
although it was felt that they would probably be good for something 
if it could only be discovered- much like the continent of Antarctica 
in ancient history.   "How can a planet with so many neighbors 
be so lonely"? Ryan asked. He was the captain, so he could 
ask questions like that.   "Some can be lonely in a crowd", 
Nogol said elaborately. ##

"WHAT will we need outside, Ryan"? 
Ekstrohm asked.   "No helmets", the captain answered. 
"We can breathe out there, all right. It just won't be easy. 
This old world lost all of its helium and trace gases long ago. Nitrogen 
and oxygen are about it".   "Ryan, look over there", 
Nogol said. "Animals. Ringing the ship. Think they're intelligent, 
maybe hostile"?   "I think they're dead", Ekstrohm 
interjected quietly. "I get no readings from them at all. Sonic, 
electronic, galvanic- all blank. According to these needles, they're 
stone dead".   "Ekstrohm, you and I will have a look", 
Ryan said. "You hold down the fort, Nogol. Take it easy".

"Easy", Nogol confirmed. "I heard a story once about 
a rookie who got excited when the captain stepped outside and he couldn't 
get an encephalographic reading on him. Me, I know the mind 
of an officer works in a strange and unfathomable manner".   "I'm 
not worried about you mis-reading the dials, Nogol, just about 
a lug like you reading them at all. Remember, when the little hand 
is straight up that's negative. Positive results start when it goes 
towards the hand you use to make your mark".   "But I'm 
ambidextrous".   Ryan told him what he could do then.   Ekstrohm 
smiled, and followed the captain through the airlock with only 
a glance at the lapel gauge on his coverall. The strong negative field 
his suit set up would help to repel bacteria and insects.   Actually, 
the types of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal 
were not infinite, and over the course of the last few hundred years 
adequate defenses had been found for all basic categories. He wasn't 
likely to come down with hot chills and puzzling striped fever.

They ignored the ladder down to the planet surface and, with only 
a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance, dropped 
to the ground.   It was day, but in the thin atmosphere contrasts 
were sharp between light and shadow. They walked from midnight 
to noon, noon to midnight, and came to the beast sprawled on its side.

Ekstrohm nudged it with a boot. "Hey, this is pretty close 
to a wart-hog".   "Uh-huh", Ryan admitted. "One of the 
best matches I've ever found. Well, it has to happen. Statistical 
average and all. Still, it sometimes gives you a creepy feeling to 
find a rabbit or a snapping turtle on some strange world. It makes 
you wonder if this exploration business isn't all some big joke, and 
somebody has been <everywhere> before you even started". ##

THE 
surveyor looked sidewise at the captain. The big man seldom 
gave out with such thoughts. Ekstrohm cleared his throat. "What shall 
we do with this one? Dissect it"?   Ryan nudged it with 
his toe, following Ekstrohm's example. "I don't know, Stormy. 
It sure as hell doesn't look like any dominant intelligent species 
to me. No hands, for one thing. Of course, that's not definite 
proof".   "No, it isn't", Ekstrohm said.   "I 
think we'd better let it lay until we get a clearer picture of the ecological 
setup around here. In the meantime, we might be thinking on 
the problem all these dead beasts represent. What killed them"?

"It looks like we did, when we made blastdown".   "But 
<what> about our landing was lethal to the creatures"?

"Radiation"? Ekstrohm suggested. "The planet is very low 
in radiation from mineral deposits, and the atmosphere seems to shield 
out most of the solar output. Any little dose of radiation might knock 
off these critters".   "I don't know about that. Maybe 
it would work the other way. Maybe because they have had virtually 
no radioactive exposure and don't have any ~R's stored up, they 
could take a <lot> without harm".   "Then maybe it was the 
shockwave we set up. Or maybe it's sheer xenophobia. They curl 
up and die at the sight of something strange and alien- like a spaceship".

"Maybe", the captain admitted. "At this stage 
of the game anything could be possible. But there's one possibility 
I particularly don't like".   "And that is"? 
"Suppose it was <not> us 
that killed these aliens. Suppose it is something 
right on the planet, native to it. I just hope it doesn't work 
on Earthmen too. These critters went real sudden". ##

EKSTROHM 
lay in his bunk and thought, the camp is quiet.   The 
Earthmen made camp outside the spaceship. There was no reason to leave 
the comfortable quarters inside the ship, except that, faced with 
a possibility of sleeping on solid ground, they simply had to get out.

The camp was a cluster of aluminum bubbles, ringed with a spy 
web to alert the Earthmen to the approach of any being.   Each 
man had a bubble to himself, privacy after the long period of enforced 
intimacy on board the ship.   Ekstrohm lay in his bunk and listened 
to the sounds of the night on Yancey-6 138. There was a keening 
of wind, and a cracking of the frozen ground. Insects there were on 
the world, but they were frozen solid during the night, only to revive 
and thaw in the morning sun.   The bunk he lay on was much more 
uncomfortable than the acceleration couches on board. Yet he knew the 
others were sleeping more soundly, now that they had renewed their 
contact with the matter that had birthed them to send them riding high 
vacuum.   Ekstrohm was not asleep.   Now there could be an 
end to pretending.   He threw off the light blanket and swung 
his feet off the bunk, to the floor. Ekstrohm stood up.   There 
was no longer any need to hide. But what was there to do? What had 
changed for him?   He no longer had to lie in his bunk all night, 
his eyes closed, pretending to sleep. In privacy he could walk 
around, leave the light on, read.   It was small comfort for insomnia.
