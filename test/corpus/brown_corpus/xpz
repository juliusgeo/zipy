passed into the corridor, their "good lucks"! following him. 
It was what they said before every performance but tonight it sounded 
different, as if he really needed it.   They were right. The 
act, cut to shreds and hastily patched together during the afternoon, 
had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone. The result had nothing 
of the polish, pace or cohesion of the previous night. Here's where 
luck would normally step in. But this was no ordinary show and Andy 
knew it. Whether he sang well or badly had nothing to do with it. 
The audience had come not to be entertained but to judge. Twenty-four 
hours had changed him from a performer to a freak.   Within this 
framework, what followed was strained, even macabre. Eliminating 
the patter and the upbeat numbers left little but blues and other songs 
of equal melancholy. The effect was as depressing as a gravestone, 
the applause irresolute and short-lived. Yet Andy plowed ahead, mouthing 
the inconsequential words as if they possessed real meaning, and 
gradually his listeners warmed to him. Their clapping grew more fervent; 
the evening was still not beyond salvaging, not as a show but for 
him as a person.   The worst was yet to come.   As Andy 
reached the finale of his act, a subdued commotion backstage drew his 
attention to the wings. Rocco Vecchio- a perspiring, haggard Vecchio- 
was standing there, flanked by two men in the uniforms of armored 
transport guards. Vecchio was nodding and pointing at the 
large suitcase he held.   Andy felt his heart thud heavily with 
relief. He waved at Fox to cut off the finale introduction. The music 
died away discordantly. He drew a deep breath. "Ladies and gentlemen, 
in place of my regular closing number tonight, I'd like to sing 
something of a different nature for you. Ray, if you please- the 
'Cradle Song'".   He sensed rather than heard the gasp 
that swept across the audience. Nor could he blame them. This particular 
song at this particular time could only be interpreted as the ultimate 
in bad taste, callous exploitation beyond the bounds of decency. 
Having no choice, he plunged into it, anyway, holding onto the microphone 
for support.   "Lullaby and goodnight **h"   His 
voice shook. For the first time in his life he forgot the lyrics midway 
through and had to cover up by humming the rest. He wondered if the 
audience would let him finish.   They did; though contemptuous, 
they were still polite. But when he was finally through, their scorn 
was made apparent. Someone clapped tentatively then quickly stopped. 
Otherwise, the silence was complete. As the lights came up, Andy 
could see that a number of patrons were already on their way toward 
the exit.   He stumbled off-stage. "My God", he muttered. 
"My God".   Hub was there to support him. "It's okay, 
Mr& Paxton. The money's here, all of it".   At this moment, 
all he could think of was what he'd been forced to undergo. "Did 
you hear them? Do you know what they think of me"?

"Bunch of damn jerks", Hub growled. "Who needs them"?

Thornburg patted his arm. "Sure, Andy, it'll be all right. 
Nothing broken that can't be mended". The words were hollow. Thornburg 
knew, better than any of them, that a public image was as fragile 
as Humpty Dumpty. All the king's horses and all the king's 
men **h   Vecchio shouldered in. "I got it, Andy. God knows 
how, but I got it. You'll never believe the places I've been 
today. I practically had to sign your life away, you'll probably fire 
me for some of the deals I had to go for, but"-   Andy 
nodded dully. "It doesn't matter, Rock. We've done our part".

He clutched that knowledge to him as he returned to his dressing 
room. The usual congratulatory crowd was conspicuously absent; 
the place had the air of a morgue. Andy had no desire to linger himself 
but Hub reported that the mob outside was still large despite the 
efforts of the police to disperse them.

His son watched until he got as far as the hall, almost out of 
sight, then hurried after. "Dad. Dad, wait".   He caught 
up with the old man in the living room. Old man Arthur had put down 
the suitcase to open the front door.   "Just this one favor, 
Dad. Just don't tell Ferguson that crazy opinion of yours".

"Why not"? The old man gave the room a stare in leaving; under 
the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory. 
"It's the truth".   "The Bartlett girl was killed by 
Mr& Dronk's son. Rossi and Ferguson have been across the street, 
talking to the kid. They've found some sort of new evidence, a bundle 
of clothes or something, and it must link the kid even stronger 
to the crime. Why won't you accept facts? The two kids were together 
a lot, they were having some kind of teen-age affair- God knows 
how far that had gone- and the kid's crippled. He limps, and the 
man who hit you and took the cane, <he> limped. My God, how much 
more do you want"?   His father looked him over closely. "You 
sound like an old woman. You should have gone to work today, 'stead 
of sneaking around spying on the Dronk house".   "Now, 
see here"-   "The trouble with you", old man Arthur 
began, and then checked himself. Young Mrs& Arthur had opened the 
oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits. The old man opened 
the door and stepped out into the sunlight. "Isn't enough time 
to go into it", he finished, and slammed the door in his son's face.

Mrs& Holden turned from the window draperies. "They 
found something else up there", she said half-aloud to the empty room. 
"They took it away, overalls or something". She walked restlessly 
across the room, then back to the windows. "Now they've gone, 
they didn't come back, and they didn't arrest that Dronk boy". 
She stood frowning and chewing her lip. She was wearing a brown cotton 
dress, cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her 
look slimmer, a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below. She 
smoothed the skirt, sat down, then stood up and went back to the windows. 
"Why on earth did I send him off to work? There was excuse 
enough to keep him home **h that young Mr& Arthur's still over 
there".   With sudden energy, she went to the phone and rang 
Holden's office and asked for him.   "I think you had better 
come home".   "Mae, we're so busy. Mr& Crosson's 
been on everybody's neck, an order he expected didn't come through 
and he's"-   "I don't care. I want you here. I'm 
all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous. I 
need someone to go out and find out what's happening".   "But 
I couldn't do that, even if I were home"! His voice grew 
high and trembling. "I can't be underfoot every time those cops turn 
around! They'll **h they'll think <I> did something".

He couldn't see the grin that split her mouth; the teeth that 
shone into the phone were like a shark's. "You'll just have 
to risk it. You can't wander along in the dark, can you? I'd 
think that you **h even more than I **h would be wondering what they're 
up to. They found some clothes", she tossed in.   "What"?

Deliberately, she ignored the yelp. "Also, that Mr& 
Ferguson was here. I guess he wants to ask you some questions. 
I stalled him off. He doesn't expect you until five".   "Then 
I'd better wait until five".   "No **h o **h o. Come 
home right away". She slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped 
away. Her eyes were bright with anticipation.   In his office, 
Mr& Holden replaced the phone slowly. He rose from his chair. 
He had to cough then; he went to the window and choked there with 
the fresh breeze on his face. He got his hat out of the closet. For 
a moment he thought of going into Crosson's office to explain that 
he had to leave, but there was now such a pain in his chest, such a 
pounding in his head, that he decided to let it go. He passed the receptionist 
in the outer office, muttering, "I've got to go out for 
a little while". Let her call Crosson if she wanted to, let Crosson 
raise the roof or even can him, he didn't care.   He got into 
the car. Putting the key into the switch, pressing the accelerator 
with his foot, putting the car into reverse, seemed vast endeavors almost 
beyond the ability of his shaking body. Once out in the street, 
the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken. When he 
turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then 
rose toward home, he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few 
minutes, sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear 
them of tears.   What on earth was in Mae's mind, that she wanted 
him up there spying on what the cops were doing? What did she 
think he could do?   He tried to ignore what his own common sense 
told him, but it wasn't possible; her motives were too blatant. 
She wanted him to get into trouble. She wanted the police to notice 
him, suspect him. She was going to keep on scheming, poking, prodding, 
suggesting, and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in 
him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions. And he knew 
in that moment, with a cold sinking of despair, a dying of old hopes, 
that Mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors. 
Nothing bald, open; but enough. They'd have some suspicions to repeat 
to the police.   Though his inner thoughts cringed at it, 
he forced himself to think back, recreating the scene in which Mae claimed 
to have caught him molesting the child.   It hadn't amounted 
to anything. There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions.

A second scene flashed before his mind, the interior of 
the garage at the new house and the young Bartlett girl turning startled 
to meet him, the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then 
the brightness as Mae had clicked on the light.   Suppose the 
cops somehow got hold of <that?>   Well, it hadn't been 
what it seemed, he'd had no idea the girl was in there. He hadn't 
touched her.   And when he came to examine the scene, there was 
a certain staginess to it, it had the smell of planning, and a swift 
suspicion darted into his mind.   Too monstrous, of course. Mae 
wouldn't have plotted a thing like that. It was just that little 
accidents played into her hands. Like this murder.   He leaned 
on the wheel, clutching it, staring into the sunlight, and tried to bring 
order into his thoughts. He felt light-headed and sick. There was 
no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare. Mae was his 
wife. She was married to him for better or for worse. She wouldn't 
be wilfully planning his destruction.   But she was. She was.

Even as the conviction of truth roared through him, shattering 
his last hope of safety, he was reaching to release the hand brake, 
to head up the road for home, doing her bidding. He drove, and the 
road wobbled, familiar scenes crept past on either side. He came to a 
stretch of old orange groves, the trees dead, some of them uprooted, 
and then there was an outlying shopping area, and tract houses. He had 
the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to 
hide. But he couldn't imagine where. There was really no place to 
go, finally, except home to Mae.   At the gate he slowed, looking 
around. Cooper was beside his car, on the curb at the right, just 
standing there morosely; he didn't even look up. Behind him on the 
steps of the little office sat old man Arthur; he was straight, 
something angry in his attitude, as if he might be waiting to report 
something. Holden stepped on the gas.   A new idea drifted in from 
nowhere. He could go to the police. He could tell them his fears 
of being involved, he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood 
and how Mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him- 
the scene was complete in his mind at the moment, even to his 
own jerkings 
and snivelings, and Ferguson's silent patience. He could throw 
himself on the mercy of the Police Department.   It wasn't 
what Mae would want him to do, though. He was sure of this. Once 
he had abandoned himself to the very worst, once he had quieted all 
the dragons of worry and suspense, there wouldn't be very much for 
Mae to do. At that moment, Holden almost slammed on the brakes to go 
back to Cooper and ask if Ferguson was about.   It would be 
such a relief.   What was that old sign, supposed to be painted
