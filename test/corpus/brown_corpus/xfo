that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will 
go up in like manner. Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits.

Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death. 
Generally, your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that 
protect him during his working life or during retirement. 

#SPECIAL TIME 
OFF#

In granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off 
and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify. 
Thus, you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth 
cousin's funeral. Also, reserve the right to demand proof of 
death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it.   Coffee 
breaks can be a real headache if not regulated. Vending machines 
can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting 
waste of production time. If coffee is sold at the cafeteria, 
let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group. Consider 
installing supplemental serving lines in production areas. Make 
sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers, 
if you are supplying the coffee. Otherwise, you may be saddled 
with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers. 

#RETIREMENT POLICIES# 

Keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool 
and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company. 
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest 
possible age. Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements 
tied into your pension plan. Younger men usually don't think 
of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're 
liable to change jobs several times before settling down.   Choose 
carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans. 
There are two sides of a coin for this decision. Workers usually think 
more of a plan they contribute to. And they can at least collect 
the money they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company. A 
non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he 
retires. Thus, there is an added incentive to stay on the job. 

#HOLIDAYS# 

Make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee 
would not otherwise be working. These include: leaves of absences, 
illnesses, and layoffs.   Consider adopting a system of holidays 
in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience 
to the operation of the plant. It's usually not too hard to sell 
workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods. For example, 
the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's 
birthday. This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and 
startups.   Require each employee to work his last shift both 
before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay. This cuts the absentee 
rate. 

#EATING FACILITIES#

Consider using vending machines 
rather than subsidized cafeterias. Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable 
prices, and at a profit to you. If a concessionaire runs the 
cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price. If the soup tastes 
like dishwater, your employees won't blame the concessionaire. You'll 
take the rap.   Check your cafeteria location to make sure 
it's convenient for most employees. You may save valuable production 
minutes with a change. 

#VACATIONS#

Spread your vacation period 
over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two 
weeks. This will cut the expense of vacation replacements. And with 
the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice 
vacation dates.   Also make sure you have reasonable requirements 
as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a 
vacation. You might try providing standard vacation time off but make 
the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous 
year. 
THE LONG and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into 
a new era. Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition. 
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away. But with 
all the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain- a few things remain 
constant, including the devotion of Americans to the great field 
sports, hunting and fishing.   As the generations move on, clothes 
become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports. Sporting 
firearms change, markedly for the better. Just as modern transportation 
has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon, the demand of 
today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.

The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through 
diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle 
loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders, 
extremely accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms. And 
millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition, 
designed for today's hunting and target shooting.   And due 
to modern resource-use and game management practices, there is still 
game to shoot, even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and 
water. Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not as an expendable 
natural resource, but as an annual harvest to be sown and also 
reaped. Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states, 
on shooting preserves (one of the newer phases of modern game-management) 
for five and six months each year.   Close to two million 
game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting 
preserves, and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas 
during the 1960-61 season. The shooting development program of the 
Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully 
published these facts in all major outdoor magazines, many national 
weeklies and the trade papers.   The most effective way to 
develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly 
managed shooting preserves. This has been the aim of the director 
of the shooting development program, the New York staff of the Sportsmen's 
Service Bureau, and the ~SAAMI shooting preserve 
field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.   Following 
the kick-off of ~SAAMI's shooting development program 
in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place in Washington, D& C&. 
The group known as the American Association for Health, Physical 
Education, and Recreation (a division of the National Education 
Association) initiated a conference which brought together representatives 
of the National Rifle Association, ~SAAMI and the American 
Fishing Tackle Manufacturers. This meeting was called to 
determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as 
the Outdoor Education Project.   The Outdoor Education Project 
took cognizance of the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic 
activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship 
to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life. The 
various team sports assuredly have their place in every school, and 
they are important to proper physical development. But with the exception 
of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical education 
activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of 
the average American man or woman.   Following a vigorous campaign 
of interpretation and leadership development by ~OEP director 
Dr& Julian Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges 
and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical 
education and recreation programs. ~SAAMI's financial support 
since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education. 
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have 
proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops, at which 
hundreds of school administrators, teachers, professors, and recreational 
leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education. Considering 
that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths, the project 
and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more 
to reach.   In 1959 ~SAAMI's shooting development program 
announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys 
and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in 
the shooting sports. This program is now nationally known as "Teen 
Hunter Clubs".   Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored 
by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation. 
The first program was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss, Hempstead, New 
York, under the direction of Special Events director Jennings 
Dennis. Other pilot programs were conducted by ~A + ~S, Babylon, 
New York; J& L& Hudson, Detroit; Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.

Other ~THC activities followed, conducted by shopping 
centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers, radio-~TV 
stations, newspapers, and other organizations interested in the 
need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting 
firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations 
related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources. ~SAAMI's 
field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 
75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic 
young Americans.   Through the efforts of ~SAAMI's 
shooting development program these shooting activities, and many 
others, including assists in the development of public and privately 
financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues, rifle and pistol marksmanship 
programs have been promoted, to mention only a few.   The 
continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will 
assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made 
aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities 
for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand. While individual 
sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of our political, 
social, educational and even religious leaders too often forget it. Help 
is needed from dealers, at the grass-roots level.   The American 
gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program 
through their industry trade association. Since ~SAAMI's 
conception in 1926, and more specifically since the adoption of the 
Shooting Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and promotional 
man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot 
for more youths and adults. We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition 
dealer, have benefited through additional sales of equipment.

Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports? Are you looking 
ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and 
girls, who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life- 
ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent 
ammunition?   <Is your 
sporting firearms and ammunition department 
primed for the expanding horizons?>   Would you like to 
organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting programs, and have information 
on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags 
on shooting preserves? Ask Sammy Shooter. 
WE WERE CAMPING a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in 
that land of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's 
famed Outer Banks. This beach campground with no trees or hills presents 
a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual 
use.   With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety 
of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now. There were 
umbrella tents, wall tents, cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup 
tents, Pop tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper trailers, 
travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes serving as 
sunshades over entire family camps.   Moving around camp we saw 
all kinds of camp stoves, lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle, 
windbreaks and sunshades. We saw similar displays in the other
