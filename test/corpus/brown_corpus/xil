but consistently, was the portrait of a man to whom serious thinking 
is alien enough that the making of a decision inhibits, when it does not 
forestall, any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence. 
This does not mean that the decision to run for office should 
inevitably have been revoked. Instead it means that the thinking in 
which decision issues has the power to determine the morality of the 
decision, as in this instance the pressure for renewed practical or legislative 
attention to the constitutional problems the decision had uncovered 
might have done. Drifting through a third illness, apparently 
without any provision for the handling of a major national emergency 
other than a talk with the vice-president, Eisenhower revealed the singularly 
static quality of his thinking. Despite three warnings, no 
sense of moral urgency impelled him to distinguish his situation, and 
thus his responsibilities, from Wilson's. ##

By contrast, the 
energetic reaction of the leader to the full demands his decision imposes 
upon him strengthens the moral intuition and gives us the measure 
of the man. Only by means of an intensive preoccupation with the detailed 
considerations following from any decision can he ensure attention 
to the practical details to be dealt with if the implications of immorality 
in the major decision are effectively to be checked. In the 
incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learns to focus 
the essence of a problem in the significant detail, and to articulate 
the distinctions which clarify the detail as significant, with what 
is sometimes astounding rapidity. Like Lincoln, he can distinguish 
his relation to God from the constitutional responsibilities a questionable 
decision exacts of him. Like Roosevelt, he can distinguish an 
attitude toward a Russian leader he may share with a host of Americans 
from the responsibilities diplomatic convention may impose upon him. 
He chooses to subordinate one to the other, sometimes reluctantly, 
accepting criticism for the lesser immoralities facts breed. The very 
nature of a choice so grounded in distinction and fact leads to the 
valid convictions which become force of will in the manifest leader. 
The capacity for making the distinctions of which diplomacy is compact, 
and the facility with language which can render them into validity 
in the eyes of other men are the leader's means for transforming the 
moral intuition into moral leadership.   The making of distinctions, 
like the perception of the great distinctions made, is an inordinately 
difficult business. Lincoln's slow progress towards the several 
marking his achievement is even now unrecognizable as such, and loosely 
interpreted as the alternation of inconsistency with vision. But 
because it is the function of the mind to turn the one into the other 
by means of the capacities with which words endow it, we do not unwisely 
examine the type of distinction, in the sphere of politics, on which 
decisions hang. Only recently, and perhaps because a television debate 
can so effectively dramatize President Kennedy's extraordinary 
mastery of detail, have the abilities on which the capacity for making 
distinctions depend begun to be clearly discernible at the level of 
politics. 
In his recent evaluation of Kennedy's potentialities for 
leadership, Walter Lippmann has cited the "precision" of his mind, 
his "immense command" of factual detail, and his "instinct for 
the crucial point" as impressive in the extreme; and it is surely 
clear that the first of these is the result of the way in which the 
individual's command of language interacts with the other two. 
For this change is not a change from one positive position to another, 
but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation. The 
liberal-conservative 
division, we might observe in passing, is not of itself 
directly involved in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle 
between ruling groups. Rather it is rooted in a difference of response 
to the threat of social disintegration. The division is not between 
those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change. 
Rather it is a division established by two absolutely different ways 
of thought with regard to man's life in society. These ways are 
absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipes for 
man's redemption from chaos.   The civilizational crisis, the 
third type of change raises the question "what are we to do"? 
on the most primitive level. For the answer cannot be derived from any 
socially cohesive element in the disrupting community. There is no 
socially existential answer to the question. For the truth formerly experienced 
by the community no longer has existential status in the community, 
nor does any answer elaborated by philosophers or theoriticians. 
In this phase of change, no idea has social acceptance and so none 
has ontological status in the community. An interregnum ensues in which 
not men but ideas compete for existence.   If we examine the 
three types of change from the point of view of their internal structure 
we find an additional profound difference between the third and the 
first two, one that accounts for the notable difference between the 
responses they evoke. The first two types of change occur within the 
inward and immanent structure of the society. The first involves a simple 
shift of interests in the society. The second involves something 
deeper, but its characteristic form focuses on a shift in policy for 
the community, not in the truth on which the community rests. Thus in 
both types attention is focused on the community itself, and its phenomenological 
life. The third type, however, wrenches attention from 
the life of action and interests in the community and focuses it on the 
ground of being on which the community depends for its existence. Voegelin 
has analyzed this experience in the case of the stable, healthy 
community. There the community, faced with the need to formulate policy 
on the level of absolute justice, can find the answer to its problem 
in the absolute truth which it holds as partially experienced. This, 
however, cannot be done by a community whose very experience of truth 
is confused and incoherent: it has no absolute standard, and consequently 
cannot distinguish the absolute from the contingent. It has 
lost its ground of being and floats in a mist of appearances. Relativism 
and equality are its characteristic diseases. Precisely at the moment 
when it has lost its vision the mind of the community turns out 
from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure 
itself. For paradigmatic history "breaks" rather than unfolds 
precisely when the movement is from order to disorder, and not from 
one order to a new order. The liberal-conservative split, to define 
it further, derives from a basic difference concerning the existential 
status of standard sought and about the spiritual experience that leads 
to its identification.   When disruptive change has penetrated 
to the third level of social order, the process of disruption rapidly 
reaches a point of no return. Indeed, it is probable that this point 
is reached the moment the third level of change begins. At that point 
we reach the "closed" historical situation: the situation in 
which man is no longer free to return to a <status quo ante>. At that 
point men become aware of the mystery of history called variously "fate", 
or "destiny", or "providence", and feel themselves 
caught helplessly in the writhing of a disrupted society. The reasons 
for this experience are rooted in the metaphysical characteristics of 
such a change.   Of all forms of being, society, or community, 
has the greatest element of determinability. Its ontological status is 
itself most tenuous because apart from individual men, who are its "matter", 
tradition, the "form" of society exists only as a shared 
perception of truth. The ontological status of society thus is constituted 
by the psychological-intellectual-volitional status of society's 
members. The content of that psychological status determines, 
ultimately, the content of civilization. Those social, civilizational 
factors not rooted in the human spirit of the group, ultimately cease 
to exist. Civilization itself- tradition- falls out of existence 
when the human spirit itself becomes confused. Civilization is what 
man has made of himself. Its massive contours are rooted in the simple 
need of man, since he is always incomplete, to complete himself.

It is not enough for man to be an ontological esse. He needs existential 
completion, he needs, that is, to move in the direction of completion. 
And the direction of that movement is determined by his perception 
of the truth about himself. He must, consequently, exist as a 
self-perceived substantive, developing agent, or he does not exist as 
man. Thus, it is no mystical intuition, but an analyzable conception 
to say that man and his tradition can "fall out of existence". This 
happens at the moment man loses the perception of moral substance 
in himself, of a nature that, in Maritain's words, is perceived as 
a "locus of intelligible necessities". An existentialist is a man 
who perceives himself only as "esse", as existence without substance.

Thus human perception and human volition is the immanent 
cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reaches 
the civilizational level. Thus with regard to the loss of tradition, 
in the change from order to disorder the metaphysics of change works 
itself out as a disruption of the individual soul, a change in which man 
continues as an objective ontological existent, but no longer as a 
man.   Further, change is a form of motion, it occurs as the act 
of a being in potency insofar as it is in potency and has not yet reached 
the terminus of the change. With regard to the change we are examining, 
the question is, at what point does the change become irreversible? 
A number of considerations suggest that this occurs early in 
the process. Change involves the displacement of form. This means that 
the inception of change itself can begin only when the factors conducive 
to change have already become more powerful than those anchoring 
the existent form in being. If the existent form is to be retained new 
factors that reinforce it must be introduced into the situation. In 
the case of social decay, form is displaced simply by the process of 
dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process. Now in the 
mere fact of the beginning of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence 
of the ontological weakness of the fading form. And when we consider 
the tenuous hold tradition has on existence, any weakening of that 
hold constitutes a crisis of existence. The retention of a tradition 
confronted with such a crisis necessitates the introduction of new 
spiritual forces into the situation. However, the crisis occurs precisely 
as a weakening of spiritual forces. It would seem, therefore, that 
in a civilizational crisis man cannot save himself. The emergence 
of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory 
of disorder. And it would seem that history is a witness to this 
truth.   As a further characterization of the liberal conservative 
split we may observe that it involves differences in the formula for 
escaping inevitabilities in history. These differences, in turn, derive 
from prior differences concerning the friendly or hostile character 
of change. 

#UNANALYZED RESPONSES#

ANXIETY AND DEEP INSECURITY 
are the characteristic responses evoked by the crisis in tradition. 
To experience them, it is not necessary for a people to be actively 
aware of what is happening to it. The process of erosion need only 
undermine the tradition and a series of consequences begin unfolding 
within the individual, while in institutions a quiet but deep transformation 
of processes occurs. Within the individual the reaction has been 
called various names, all, however, pointing to the same basic experience. 
Weil identifies it as being "rootless", Guardini as being 
"placeless", Riesman as being "lonely". Others call it "alienation", 
and mean by that no simple economic experience (as Marx 
does) but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation. Within institutions 
there is a marked decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution 
of a force-fear process which masquerades as the earlier one 
of persuasion. We note the use of rhetoric as a weapon, the manipulation 
of the masses by propaganda, the "mobilization" of effort and 
resources.   Within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed 
responses to the experience of civilizational crisis, two basic organizations 
of response are observable: reaction and ideological progressivism. 
These responses are explicable in terms of characteristics inherent 
in the crisis. Both are predictably destined to fail.   The 
response of reaction is dominated by a concern for what is vanishing. 
Its essence lies in its attempt to recover previous order through
