much as I regret losing the story".   "Nobody's giving 
anything up", Robinson said. He stood there, towering over them 
all: gentle, mighty, determined, the moving force in the group; and 
yet like a child among adults. "You think I got you and Artie and 
Herr Schaffner all the way out here just for the boat ride? I'm 
going down again".   "That's my boy"! Mr& Forsythe 
exclaimed. "Rob's not going to give up as easy as all that". 
He was a florid, puffy man in his early sixties, very natty in his 
yachting cap, striped jacket and white flannels. He went to Key West 
every fall and winter and was the only man in town who did not know 
that his title of "Commodore" was never used without irony. Old 
Commodore Forsythe, who had once lost a fifty-dollar bet on whether 
he could get both motors started and turn on the running lights without 
accidentally turning on something else first. Now it did not occur 
to him even to wonder whether it was wise for Robinson to dive again: 
Rob was his boy, the kid he had rescued from the streets, the object 
of his pride.   "Why", he went on, "when Rob asked me 
if he could make his dive on this trip, I didn't think twice about 
it. I've helped him along ever since he was a youngster hanging around 
his brother's tackle shop. Hell, I gave him the first decent 
job he ever had, six, seven- how many years ago was it, Rob"?

"Seven years ago, Commodore", Rob said impassively. He was 
thinking, big deal: skipper on his drunken fishing parties for seven 
years and no better off than when I started. "Excuse me", he 
said abruptly. He went down the steps to the galley and sleeping quarters; 
went into the forward stateroom and locked the door behind him.

"When you gotta go, you gotta go", Mrs& Forsythe said.

Waddell muttered something about taking a look around and 
climbed up to the flying bridge. He was disturbed by what had happened 
on the dive and by what he remembered of a conversation he had had the 
night before with the German, who had come out of the head while he 
was fixing himself a drink in the galley.   "Hi there, Schaffner", 
he had said. "Can I make you one"?   "No thank 
you very much", Schaffner had answered in his accented English. 
"I do not drink so much, thank you".   Waddell had looked the 
man over, trying to size him up. He was in his early forties, rather 
short and very compactly built, and with a manner that was reserved 
and stiff despite his efforts to adapt himself to American ways. His 
open face seemed to promise a sort of innocence, until one looked into 
his eyes, which had no warmth in them but only alert intelligence. 
Waddell had heard that he had been a commando in Rommel's Afrika 
Corps, and he said to himself: I'd hate to run into him in the desert 
on a dark night. Aloud he had said, making conversation:

"Rob tells me he's using your Atlantis equipment on the dive".

"Yes", Herr Schaffner had said.   "He's one 
hell of a decent boy. I like that kid".   "I agree, yes".

"And if the dive goes ~OK he has the exclusive import 
rights to your line for this country, is that right"?   "Well, 
no", Herr Schaffner said.   Waddell turned to face him. 
"No"? he asked. "But that's what he told me. Why, that's 
his main reason for making the dive".   Shaffner looked at 
him, altogether without guile, and shrugged his shoulders, making a 
little spreading gesture with his two hands.   "What do you mean"? 
Waddell asked, frowning.   "Please let me explain", 
the German said earnestly, his face still devoid of deceit. "I have 
in Europe a gross business of seven million dollars the year. Now 
I wish to enter the American market, where the competition is very 
strong. I must have a powerful representative here, a firm with a national 
distribution and ten, twenty thousand dollars to advertise my 
products. With all respect to a fine young man, Mr& Roy is not able 
to provide these necessaries".   Waddell was not an eminently 
moral person, but he did not like what he had just heard. "Did you 
tell him all this"? he asked.   "Perhaps not in so many 
words", the German said. "But surely you have misunderstood Mr& 
Roy. Never, never did I offer him the exclusive rights. We spoke 
of the need for advertising, and I agreed that the deep dive would 
be most useful for publicity. He was most eager to make the dive; 
of course, I was willing. But there was no definite agreement about 
business arrangements".   "Well, damn", Waddell said. There 
was the end of his front-page feature story, with byline. He started 
out the door.   "One moment"! Herr Schaffner said. "You 
intend to speak with Mr& Roy"?   "What else"? 
Waddell asked.   "If you will pardon, I think it would be 
better if not. Mr& Roy is determined to make this dive. Whatever 
you tell him he will dive. I know this from my talks with him".

"Well, let's let him make up his own mind, ~OK"? Waddell 
said. "On the basis of the facts".   "You will make 
him unhappy and anxious", the German said. "At 200, 300, 400 feet 
under the water, when he must be paying very much attention, he will 
be thinking about what you are telling him. It is not good, Mr& 
Waddell: you will do him great harm".   There was no doubt 
that Herr Schaffner meant every word of what he said. Waddell came 
back from the door and sat on a bunk.   "I am an honest man", 
the German said with fervor. "I will give Mr& Roy his due for 
this dive. I will make him distributor for all of Florida- a big 
market. All tourists come to Florida. This will help him to get out 
of his little tackle shop. Yes! But there is no use causing him 
to worry at this time".   The German's words worked on the 
newspaperman like a reprieve from an odious duty. He took a big swig 
of his drink. It would be a colossal shame to throw away a story like 
this. "I think maybe you're right, Schaffner", he said. "He 
has the distributorship for Florida, you say"?   "Yes", 
the German said. "At least for South Florida".   "By 
God", Waddell said, "we don't want to upset the boy at this 
time of all times. I guess you're right". He sloshed his drink 
around and drained it in a few large gulps. The story was shaping up 
nicely in his mind: the young pioneer, as of old, altruistically braving 
the unknown; the rewards prompt and juicy in modern big-business 
America. "Join me in another"? he had asked.   "Thank 
you", the German had said courteously. "I do not drink so much".

Now, in that same cabin, Robinson fell to his knees beside 
a bunk. Fear and relief mingled in his churning emotions. He pressed 
his palms together and addressed himself to the patron saint of divers 
in a hurried and anxious whisper.   "Blessed Saint Nicholas, 
I thank thee for getting me out of that mess and sending me up 
instead of down when I was bewildered. And when I make the dive again"- 
He paused; crossed himself; said a Hail Mary, slowly and 
with understanding. Folding between his hands the cross that hung 
from his neck, he took his appeal direct to Headquarters. "Holy Mary, 
Mother of God, Star of the Sea, stay Thou with me on this next 
dive. Make it come off all right. Let me set the record this time, 
and let me get back ~OK, so the German will give me the exclusive. 
And make my life different and better from this time on. Amen".

He crossed himself again and rose. He felt a good deal less 
shaky. As he reached for the door there was a knock on it and when 
he opened he found Artie, who came in and sat down on a bunk. Artie 
had picked up a snorkle and was twirling it on his forefinger. He waited 
awhile before he said, "Roy, you know your decompression table, 
don't you"?   "You know I know it", Robinson answered 
warily.   "You came straight up from 275 without a stop", 
Artie said.   "Well, I was a little bit confused. Anyway, 
I wasn't down long enough to matter. You don't see me stretched 
out 
on the deck, do you"?   "You know what they say about two 
deep dives in one day", Artie went on, still twirling the snorkle and 
studying it intently. "I don't think you should go down again".

EARLY that day Matsuo saw a marine. The enemy came looming 
around a bend in the trail and Matsuo took a hasty shot, then fled 
without knowing the result, ran until breath was a pain in his chest 
and his legs were rubbery. As his feet slowed, he felt ashamed of the 
panic and resolved to make a stand. He crossed the next meadow and 
climbed a tree where the jungle trail resumed.   In the leafiest 
part of the tree, straddling a broad horizontal limb, he could see over 
the meadow. For 
a while he was content to let events develop in their 
good time. He had no doubt the marine was the lead scout of a column, 
and while his shot had probably bred indecision, they would soon come 
hunting.   His superiors had emphasized that marines tortured 
others for the sheer pleasure. Yesterday; today; tomorrow: no 
surrender. His remembering the self-dictate brought no peace- only 
a faint chill of doubt. He murmured to himself, with firmness: "No 
surrender". It was best to die fighting the marines. His superiors 
had also preached this, saying it was the way for eternal honor.

What if the marines never came? His comrades were all dead. 
He had no rice. Then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide.

Whichever the way, he would rot in this vast choking green, 
his wife never to receive an urn of his ashes. He sighed and leaned 
for a moment against the trunk. His fingers touched the bone handle 
of a knife. The knife, an ammunition pouch, and a half-filled bottle 
of purified water hung on his belt. Besides the belt he wore a loin 
cloth.   As he looked up from picking at a leg ulcer, he saw 
a marine in the jungle across the clearing. Gloom receded.   The 
marine came to the edge of the green jungle mist and stayed, as though 
debating whether to brave the sunlight. His fatigues made a streak 
of almost phosphorescent green in the mist.   "Come out, come 
out in the meadow", Matsuo said under his breath.   The man 
leaned against a tree and wiped a sleeve across his face. A signal? 
Matsuo lifted his rifle, easing the sling under his left upper arm for 
steadiness.   Fresh on his mind were events of the past day when 
his whole regiment was destroyed in the hills. They had fought from 
caves, and the marines resorted to burning them out. Even now, like 
a ringing in his ears, he heard the <wooooosh> of flame-throwers squirting 
great orange billows. A wave of flame rippling through their 
cave had reached Nagamo, his friend, and with a shriek the man bolted 
through the entrance, then slowed to the jerky walk of a puppet, his 
uniform blazing. The marines let him advance. When he sank on his knees, 
they had allowed him to char without administering the stroke of 
mercy.   Matsuo had faked death and was pitched on a stack of corpses, 
both the burned and the unburned, the latter decomposing rapidly 
under the tropical sun. The callous marines had laughed at each other's 
retching, while stacking bodies. Matsuo repeatedly choked down 
his own nausea. At nightfall he had been able to sneak down a hillside 
and into the jungle, reeking of death.   Apprehensively he 
peered 
to the left, to the right into the leafy, vine-crisscrossed maze. 
He decided that the marines must be deploying around the meadow, with 
the one left to distract him. He strained his hearing. Cautious feet 
stepping on leafmold; faint creaking of belts and slings; whispers: 
he heard none of these. Only the hum of insects and the distant 
fluttering call of a bird. Because he couldn't hear them, he was 
more convinced they were there.   A spectacle occurred across the 
meadow: the lone marine took a seat on the ground; leaning sidewise 
on a tree trunk, he embraced it. Humiliation made Matsuo tremble. 
While his comrades cocked the trap, that one behaved as if it was some 
dull maneuver. Taking aim at the man's face, Matsuo squeezed the 
trigger up to the point of discharge, and then he changed his mind. 
He wanted the arrogant marine to know fear, and so he aimed above the
