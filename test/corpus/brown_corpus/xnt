communities. It is interesting to note how many of the plants on Massachusetts' 
Route 128 draw most of their income either from the government 
in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements, or from the exploitation 
of patents which grant at least a partial monopoly. ##

While 
the factories were always the center of the labor market, they were 
often on the city's periphery. In spreading the factories even farther, 
the automobile may not have changed to any great extent the growth 
pattern of the cities. Even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt's 
motel has been relatively painless; the hotel-motel demarcation 
is becoming harder to find every year. What hurts most is the damage 
the automobile has done to central-city retailing, especially in 
those cities where public transit is feeble.   Some retailing, 
of course, always spreads with the population- grocery stores, drugstores, 
local haberdasheries and dress shops, candy stores and the like. 
But whenever a major purchase was contemplated forty years ago- a 
new bedroom set or a winter coat, an Easter bonnet, a bicycle for Junior- 
the family set off for the downtown department store, where the 
selection would be greatest. Department stores congregated in the 
"one hundred per cent location", where all the transit lines converged. 
These stores are still there, but the volume of the "downtown 
store" has been on a relative decline, while in many cities the suburban 
"branch" sells more and more dry goods. If the retailer and 
hotelman's downtown unit sales have been decreasing, however, his dollar 
volume continues to rise, and it is dollars which you put in the 
bank.   In most discussions of this phenomenon, the figures are 
substantially inflated. No suburban shopping-center branch- not even 
Hudson's vast Northland outside Detroit- does anything like 
the unit volume of business or carries anything like the variety of merchandise 
to be found in the home store. Telephone orders distort the 
picture: the suburbanite naturally calls a local rather than a central-city 
number if both are listed in an advertisement, especially if 
the local call eliminates city sales tax. The suburban branch is thereby 
credited with a sale which would have been made even if its glass 
doors had never opened. Accounting procedures which continue to charge 
a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store 
make the branches seem more profitable than they are. In many cases 
that statement "We break even on our downtown operation and make money 
on our branches" would be turned around if the cost analysis were 
recalculated on terms less prejudicial to the old store. Fear of the 
competition- always a great motivating force in the American economy- 
makes retailers who do <not> have suburban operations exaggerate 
both the volume and the profitability of their rival's shiny new 
branches. The fact seems to be that very many large branch stores are 
uneconomical, that the choice of location in the suburbs is as important 
as it was downtown, and that even highly suburbanized cities will 
support only so many big branches. Moreover, the cost of operations 
is always high in <any> new store, as the conservative bankers who 
act as controllers for retail giants are beginning to discover.

When all has been said, however, the big branch store remains a major 
break with history in the development of American retailing. Just 
as the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant 
to the worker with a car, the trip to the shopping center may seem far 
easier than to the downtown department store, though both are the same 
distance from home. Indeed, there are some cities where the suburban 
shopping pulls customers who are geographically much nearer to downtown. 
Raymond Vernon reports that residents of East St& Louis 
have been driving across the Mississippi, through the heart of downtown 
St& Louis and out to the western suburbs for major shopping, simply 
because parking is easier at the big branches than it is in the heart 
of town. To the extent that the problem is merely parking, an aggressive 
downtown management, like that of Lazarus Brothers in Columbus, 
Ohio, can fight back successfully by building a garage on the lot 
next door. If the distant patron of the suburban branch has been frightened 
away from downtown by traffic problems, however, the city store 
can only pressure the politicians to do something about the highways 
or await the completion of the federal highway program. And if the 
affection for the suburban branch reflects a desire to shop with "nice 
people", rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which supports 
the downtown department store, the central location may be in serious 
trouble. Today, according to land economist Homer Hoyt, shopping 
centers and their associated parking lots cover some 46,000 acres 
of land, which is almost exactly the total land area in all the nation's 
Central Business Districts put together.   The downtown 
store continues to offer the great inducement of variety, both within 
its gates and across the street, where other department stores are immediately 
convenient for the shopper who wants to see what is available 
before making up her mind. If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver 
world of retailing, it seems likely that the suburban branch will 
come to dominate children's clothing (taking the kid downtown is 
too much of a production), household gadgetry and the discount business 
in big-ticket items. Department stores were built on dry goods, especially 
ladies' fashions, and in this area, in the long run, the suburban 
branches will be hard put to compete against downtown. If this 
analysis is correct, the suburban branches will turn out to be what management's 
cost accountants refuse to acknowledge, marginal operations 
rather than major factors.   Historically in America the appeal 
of cities has been their color and life, the variety of experience 
they offered. "How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm"? was 
a question that had to be asked long before they saw Paree. Though 
Americans usually lived in groups segregated by national origin or religious 
belief, they liked to work and shop in the noise and vitality 
of downtown. Only a radical change in the nature of the population in 
the central city would be likely to destroy this preference- and we 
must now turn our attention to the question of whether such a change, 
gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians, is actually upon us. 

#4. SUBURBS AND NEGROES#

In their book <American Skyline,> 
Christopher Tunnard and Henry Hope Reed argue that Franklin Roosevelt's 
New Deal was what made the modern suburb a possibility- 
a fine ironical argument, when you consider how suburbanites tend to 
vote. The first superhighways- New York's Henry Hudson and Chicago's 
Lake Shore, San Francisco's Bay Bridge and its approaches, 
a good slice of the Pennsylvania Turnpike- were built as 
part of the federal works program which was going to cure the depression. 
At the same time, Roosevelt's Federal Housing Administration, 
coupled with Henry Morgenthau's cheap-money policy, permitted 
ordinary lower-middle-class families to build their own homes. Bankers 
who had been reluctant to lend without better security than the house 
itself got that security from the U& S& government; householders 
who had been unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest 
mortgages found they could borrow for twenty-five years at 4 per 
cent, under government aegis. 
Before losing itself in the sands of the 19th Century, the grand stream 
of Italian Renaissance architectural decoration made a last appearance 
in the Brumidi frescos of the Capitol Rotunda in Washington.

The artistic generation after Brumidi was trained in the Paris 
of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution, and tended 
to overlook greatness of conception where faults and weakness were 
easy to find. But it is a great conception. The open ceiling, with 
allegorical and classical figures thrown in masses against the sky: 
the closed frieze, formally divided into historical scenes and tightly 
tied to the stone walls, belong in their large ordering to the line 
of Correggio and his Baroque followers. The descent may be remote, 
but this is surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance 
in the United States.   Constantino Brumidi designed the 
decorative scheme as a whole, in collaboration with the architect Charles 
U& Walter, at the time when plans were being made to replace 
the wooden dome of Bullfinch with the present much larger iron structure. 
After many years and many interruptions he was able to finish 
the canopy fresco, and slightly less than half the frieze, beginning 
with the Liberty group opposite the East door, and ending with William 
Penn, all but one leg, when a tragic accident ended his career. 
He left at his death sketches, drawn to scale, for the rest of the circle. 
These were carried out not too faithfully by Filippo Costaggini, 
who began by supplying the missing member to the founder of Pennsylvania 
and noting in pencil, in Italian, that he "began at this point".

When Costaggini had used up all the sketches thirty-six 
feet of empty frieze were left over. A blank undecorated void, plastered 
in roughcast, disfigured the wall of the Rotunda until 1951. Then, 
advised by the Architect of the Capitol, the Joint Committee 
for the Library, traditionally responsible for the works of art in the 
building, ordered the space cleared and painted in fresco, to show 
"the Peace after the Civil War", "the Spanish-American War", 
and "the Birth of Aviation", to match as nearly as feasible 
Brumidi's technique and composition. Later the cleaning and restoration 
were ordered, first of the older part of the frieze, finally of 
the canopy. What follows is therefore a description of three separate 
undertakings, the new frescoing of the gap, and the successive essays 
in conservation, with some discussion of problems that arose in connection 
with each.   For the use of students and future restorers, 
a full, day-by-day record was kept of all three undertakings, complete 
technical reports on what we found and what we did. These may be consulted 
in the office of the Architect of the Capitol, or the Library 
of Congress.   The first preliminary was inspecting the unfinished 
length of frieze, a jumble of roughcast and finish coats, all 
in 
bad condition. It was decided to strip the whole area down to the bricks, 
and to replace the rough coats up to one inch thickness to agree 
with the older artists' preparation, with a mortar, one part slaked 
lime, three parts sand, to be put on in two layers. Cartoons were drawn 
full size, after sketches had been made to satisfy all the authorities. 
There was some difficulty here. One had to manage the given subjects, 
three diverse recent events, so as to make them part of a classical 
frieze,- that is, a pattern of large figures filling the space, 
with not much else, against a blank background. Moreover, all three 
representations must be squeezed comfortably into little more than the 
length Brumidi allowed for each one of his.   When it was all 
arranged to fit, and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement 
in the frieze, the cartoons were tried in place. The scaffolding, a 
confusion of heavy beams hanging from the gallery above, was strong and 
safe, but obscured visibility. Nothing could be seen from the floor, 
but by moving around the gallery one could get glimpses; and we were 
able to decide on some amplification of scale. To be sure of matching 
color as well as form, pieces of cartoon were traced on the roughcast, 
and large samples painted in fresco, then left two months to dry 
out to their final key. Later it was gratifying to note that they had 
set so solidly as to be hard to remove when the time came.   The 
scaffold was the length of the space to be painted. What bits of Brumidi 
and Costaggini could be reached at either end seemed in good 
order, though the roughish sandy surface was thick with dust. Washed, 
they came out surprisingly clear and bright. It could be seen that 
both artists used a very thick final coat of plaster, one half inch, 
and that both followed the traditional Italian fresco technique as described 
by Cennino Cennini in the 14th Century, and current in Italy 
to this day. That is, they used opaque color throughout, getting solid 
highlights with active lime white. Painting "a secco" is much 
in evidence. A brown hatching reinforces and broadens shadows, and 
much of the background is solidly covered with a dark coat. This brown 
is sometimes so rich in medium as to appear to be oil paint. 
In our own practice, to have the last "intonaco" plaster coat thick 
enough to match, and at the same time to avoid fine cracks in 
drying, 
we found that it had to be put on in two layers, letting the first
