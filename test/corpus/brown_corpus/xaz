
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration 
several months ago. Charles A& Black, ~COAHR chairman, 
said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet 
with the students on Oct& 31 but had failed to show up. He declined 
to name the three.   Friday's letters asked for a Nov& 15 
meeting. Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend, 
the letters said, would be considered a "sign of indifference".

Black said ~COAHR "hoped to be able to integrate the 
theaters without taking direct action, but we are pledged to using every 
legal and nonviolent means at our disposal **h"   A 
prepared 
statement released by the student group Friday stated that "extensive 
research by ~COAHR into techniques and methods of theater 
integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines 
and stand-ins 
before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits **h"

Besides managers of downtown theaters, the students sent 
letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead.

A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking 
into the home of relatives in search of his wife, hitting his uncle with 
a rock and assaulting two police officers who tried to subdue him, 
police said.   Patrolmen J& W& Slate and A& L& Crawford 
Jr& said they arrested Ronald M& Thomas, of 1671 Nakoma 
St&, ~NW, after he assaulted the officers. 

#POLICE ACCOUNT# 

The officers gave this account:   Thomas early Sunday went 
to the home of his uncle and aunt, Mr& and Mrs& R& C& Thomas, 
511 Blanche St&, ~NW, looking for his wife, Margaret Lou 
Thomas, 18, and their 11-month-old baby.   The younger Thomas 
ripped a screen door, breaking the latch, and after an argument struck 
his uncle with a rock, scratching his face. He also struck his aunt 
and wife, and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches.

When police arrived the man was still violent, Slate said. 

#ATTACKS 
OFFICER#

He attacked one of the officers and was restrained. 
About five minutes later he jumped up, Slate said, and struck the 
two policemen again.   He was then subdued and placed in the police 
car to be taken to Grady Hospital for treatment of scratches received 
in the melee. Then he attacked the two officers again and was again 
restrained, Slate related.   Slate said he and Crawford received 
cuts and scratches and their uniforms were badly torn. 
Thomas was charged with four counts of assault and battery. Two counts 
of assault on an officer, resisting arrest, disturbance and cursing, 
police said. A hearing was set for 8:30 a&m& Tuesday.

Mrs& Mary Self, who knows more than any other person about 
the 5,000 city employes for whom she has kept personnel records over 
the years, has closed her desk and retired.   Over the weekend, 
Mrs& Self, personnel clerk, was a feted and honored guest of the 
Atlanta Club, organization of women employes at City Hall. 
After 18 years in the personnel office, she has taken a disability pension 
on advice of her doctors.   As personnel clerk, she handled 
thousands of entries, ranging from appointments to jobs, to transfers 
to other employments, to pensions.   "I have enjoyed it and 
will feel a bit lost at least for a while", she said wistfully Friday.

One of the largest crowds in the club's history turned out 
to pay tribute to Mrs& Self and her service.

Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire 
ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading 
pest.   The department is planning to expand its eradication 
program soon to four additional counties- Troup, Pierce, Bryan 
and Bulloch- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants, according 
to W& E& Blasingame state entomologist.   Low-flying planes 
will spread a granular-type chemical, heptachlor, over 30,000 acres 
in Troup, 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and 
Bryan counties.

The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb 
and Jones counties, over 37,679 acres. The department has just finished 
treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon.   Also being 
treated are Houston, Bleckley, Tift, Turner and Dodge counties, 
Blasingame said. The fire ant is thought to infest approximately 
two million acres of land in Georgia, attacking crops, young wildlife 
and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic 
to its venom, Blasingame said.

The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will 
be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week. 
This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase 
of a traffic survey on the North Expressway. Students have been 
using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study. 
Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and 
suggest methods to eliminate it.   Incidentally, 14th Street 
and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight 
hours. It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue, ~NE; 
the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones 
Avenue and Marietta Street, ~NW.

Four persons died in Georgia weekend traffic crashes, two of 
them 
in a fiery crash near Snellville, the State Patrol said Sunday.

The latest death reported was that of 4-year-old Claude Douglas 
Maynor of Calvary. Troopers said the child ran into the path 
of a passing car a half-mile north of Calvary on Georgia 111 in Grady 
County.   That death occurred at 6:50 p&m& Friday and 
was reported Sunday, the patrol said. 

#BURSTS INTO FLAMES#

flames near Snellville, the patrol said.   Bobby Bester Hammett, 
21, of Rte& 3, Lawrenceville, and Mrs& Lucille Herrington 
Jones, 23, of Lawrenceville, died in the flaming car, the patrol 
said. 

_SALEM (SPECIAL)_- For a second month in a row, Multnomah County 
may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an 
unusually high summer month's need, the state public welfare commission 
was told Friday.   It is the only county in the state so 
far this month reporting a possible shortage in ~GA category, for 
which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary.

William Smythe, director of field service, told the commissioners 
that Multnomah, as of Aug& 22, had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted 
$66,000 in the category, leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month.

At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the 
month, this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000. But it probably 
will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of 
each month, Smythe said. No request for emergency allotment had yet 
been received, however. 

#BOARD OKS PACT#

The commission, meeting 
for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners, Roy 
Webster, of Hood River, and Dr& Ennis Keizer, of North Bend, 
approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing 
department who has been the center of considerable controversy in 
the past.   The contract with Ray Field, who has been converting 
the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape, would 
renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours 
a month.   Field does the planning for the machine operations 
and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to 
new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes.

Acting Administrator Andrew F& Juras said that because 
of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program, the 
agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for 
a period.   But he emphasized that the agency must train people 
within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles, and he said he personally 
"regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the 
past".   He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency 
was literally dependent now on the machine processing, "and the whole 
wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four 
persons directing it were to leave". 

#SALARY TERMED MODEST#

Juras 
said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only 
and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not 
to other agencies of the government. He also said that the salary,
