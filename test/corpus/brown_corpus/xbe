such as belting, bearings, etc&.   Cotton processing equipment 
is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy. 
New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of 
recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year.

Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 
mark in March for the first time this year.   Totaling 3,399, 
sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963. However, compared 
with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441, this March was off 23 per 
cent.   On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, the first quarter of 
1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 
3-month total of 11,744.   This year-to-year decline for Dallas 
County closely follows the national trend- estimated sales of domestic 
cars in the U&S& for first three months of 1961 were about 
1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier.

With the March pickup, dealers are optimistic that the 
April-June quarter will equal or top last year. The March gain plus 
this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost 
production schedules for the next quarter.   On the local level, 
compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense 
of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars. Only three standard 
models- Buick, Chrysler, and Mercury- had slight year-to-year 
gains in March sales in the county.

The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high 
schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet 
at 6 p&m& Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-Dallas 
Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education 
project.   Now in its third year, the program is designed 
to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing 
and salesmanship. Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment 
to supplement classroom instruction in these fields.   More 
than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 
firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis. 
Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T& Owens, national 
sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp& of New York. 
The 33 honored students are: Mike Trigg, Raymond Arrington, and 
Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams, Janice Whitney, Fil Terral, 
and Carl David Page of W& H& Adamson; Bill Burke, Tommie 
Freeman, and Lawrence Paschall of N& R& Crozier Tech&

The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal 
proposals, particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration, 
came under fire in Dallas last week.   The Administration's 
proposals, complex and sweeping as they are, all deal with fringe 
areas of the housing market rather than its core, stated Caron 
S& Stallard, first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association 
of America. 

_SANTA BARBARA_- "The present recovery movement will gather steady 
momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn", 
Beryl W& Sprinkel, economist of Harris Trust + Savings 
Bank, Chicago, predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment 
Bankers Assn&, California group, conference.   Another 
speaker, William H& Draper, Jr&, former Under Secretary 
of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper, 
Gaither + Anderson, urged the U&S& to "throw down the 
gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be 
pushed arouny any more". He urged support for President Kennedy's 
requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations. #'NOT 
FLASH IN PAN'#

Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement 
in economic activity was not a "temporary flash in the pan" 
but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry 
the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our 
traditional growth pattern.   "In view of the current expansion, 
which promises to be substantial" he said the odds appear to favor 
rising interest rates in coming months, but "there is reason to 
believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as 
in late 1959 and 1960". 

#THESIS REFUTED#

Sprinkel strongly refuted 
the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of 
limited and slow growth, declaring that this pessimism "is based 
on 
very limited and questionable evidence".   Rather than viewing 
the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost 
prospects for growth", he said "it should be viewed as a lesson 
well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement 
in this recovery". 

#DANGER CITED#

He cautioned that "the 
greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government 
which could bring moderate inflation".   The economist 
does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery 
and believes it "even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will 
aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn 
as was the case in 1958".   The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion, 
he said, was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our 
economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies 
combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike. 

#SACRIFICES NEEDED#

Draper declared, "As I see it, this 
country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today. We 
must justify our heritage. We must be ready for any needed sacrifice".

He said that from his experience of two years with Gen& 
Clay in West Berlin administration, that "Russia respects our show 
of strength, but that presently we're not acting as we should and 
must".   He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail 
action, and noted that in war "you can't buy yourself out and 
that's what we're trying to do".   While he declined to suggest, 
how, he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro, 
"for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this 
hemisphere. Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and 
I don't believe we can permit that". 

_NEW YORK (~AP)_- {Stock market Tuesday staged a technical 
recovery, erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press 
average and making the largest gain in about two weeks.}   Analysts 
saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under 
way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for "support 
level" represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial 
average. It was a level at which some of the investors standing on 
the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented 
in the averages. 

#SOME GOOD NEWS#

Although it looked like a routine 
technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some 
good news. A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods 
was reported for last month.   Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon 
said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next 
year, paving the way for lower taxes.   The Dow Jones industrial 
average advanced 7.19 to 687.87.   Of 1,253 issues traded, 695 
advanced and 354 declined. New highs for the year totaled nine and 
new lows 14.   Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day. 
Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday.

A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was 
envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G& Peterson, head 
of one of the world's greatest camera firms, in a key address before 
the American Marketing Assn&.   However, Peterson, president 
of Bell + Howell, warned 800 U&S& marketing leaders attending 
a national conference at the Ambassador, that the future will 
belong to the industrialist of creative and "unconventional wisdom". 

#CREATION'S NEEDED#

"As we look to the $800 billion economy 
that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer 
expenditures that will be required to reach that goal, management 
can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new 
products will be created and marketed", Peterson said.   "With 
this kind of new product log-jam, the premium for brilliant 
product 
planning will obviously go up geometrically".   The executive 
paid tribute to research and development and technology for their 
great contributions in the past, but he also cautioned industry that 
they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace 
within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which 
it often needs. 

#NOTHING TO FEAR#

Peterson said America has nothing 
to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both 
marketing and product ideas. He cited, as an example, how the American 
camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition 
of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs, by improving its production 
know-how and technology.   He also used as an example the 
manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany, with 
the result that it became the best selling camera in the German 
market.

Election of Howard L& Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast 
Stock Exchange, effective Tuesday, has been announced by Thomas 
P& Phelan, president of the exchange.   Taylor, president 
and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co&, Beverly Hills, has been 
active in the securities business since 1925.

Union Oil Co& of California Tuesday offered $120 million 
in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by 
Dillon, Read + Co&, to raise money to retire a similar amount held 
by Gulf Oil Corp&.   Gulf's holdings could have been converted 
into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of 
debentures plus cash, according to Union. Under the new offering, only 
$60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares.
