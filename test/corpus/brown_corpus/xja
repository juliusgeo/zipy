the facts, and not as a rule by playing clever tricks.   One day 
I tired of following the Hetman's advice of "shadowing" and 
of the "ring-around-the-rosie" approach to a report that Enrico Caruso 
had pinched a lady's hip while visiting the Central Park monkey 
house. I explained my state of mind to artist Winsor McCay and 
to "Bugs" Baer. Mr& Baer obtained a supply of crepe hair and 
spirit-gum from an actor at the Friars. We fashioned beards, put 
them on, and reported to the Hetman at the city desk.   Mr& 
Baer had an auburn beard, like Longfellow's. Mr& McCay had on 
a sort of Emperor Maximilian beard and mustache. As for myself, I 
had on an enormous black "muff". This, together with a derby hat 
and horn-rim eyeglasses, gave me the appearance of a Russian nihilist.

"We are ready for your next mysterious assignment", said 
Mr& Baer to the Hetman. "Where to, sir"?   Mr& Watson 
did not have much humor in his make-up, but he managed a mirthless 
smile. Just then a reporter telephoned in from the Bronx to give 
the rewrite desk an account of a murder. The Hetman told me to take 
the story over the phone and to write it. While I was sitting at one 
of the rewrite telephones with my derby and my great beard, Arthur 
Brisbane whizzed in with some editorial copy in his hand. He paused 
for a moment to look at me, then went on to the city desk to deliver 
his "Today" column.   I thought it expedient to take off my 
derby, my glasses, and the beard; and also to change telephones. I 
managed to do this by the time the great A&B& returned to the place 
where he last had seen the fierce nihilist. He stood there staring 
with disbelief at the vacant desk. Then he wrinkled his huge brow 
and went slowly out of the room. He had a somewhat goggle-eyed expression. 
He had been "seeing things".   The Hetman's 
"ideas" 
for news stories or editorial campaigns were by no means always fruitless 
or lacking in merit. He campaigned successfully for the riddance 
of "Death Avenue" and also brought about the ending of pollution 
of metropolitan beaches by sewage. He exposed the bucket-shop racket 
with the able assistance of two excellent reporters, Nat Ferber 
and Carl Helm. In the conduct of these and many other campaigns, the 
Hetman proved to be a much abler journalist than his critics allowed.

It seems to me now, in a long backward glance, that many of 
the Hetman's conceits and odd actions- together with his grim posture 
when brandishing the hatchet in the name of Mr& Hearst- were 
keyed with the tragedy which was to close over him one day. Alone, 
rejected on every hand, divorced, and in financial trouble, he leaped 
from an eleventh-floor window of the Abbey Hotel in 1937.   One 
finds it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who waited 
for days for a saving word from his zealously served idol, W&R& 
Hearst. That word was withheld when the need of it seemed the measure 
of his despair. The unfinished note, written in pencil upon the back 
of a used envelope, and addressed to the coroner, makes one wonder 
about many things: "God forgive me for everything. <I cannot> 
**h"   Much to Damon Runyon's amazement, as well as my own, 
I got along splendidly with the Hetman; that is, until I became 
an editor, hence, in his eyes, a rival. Not long after Colonel Van 
Hamm had foisted me on the Watson staff I received a salary raise 
and a contract on the Hetman's recommendation. During the next years 
he gave me the second of the five contracts I would sign with the 
Hearst Service. It was a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to 
have a contract in those days before the epidemic of syndicated columnists. 
I would like to believe that my ability warranted this advancement. 
Somehow I think that Watson paid more attention to me than he 
otherwise might have because his foe, Colonel Van Hamm, wouldn't 
touch me with a ten-foot blue pencil.   I remember one day when 
Mr& Hearst (and I never knew why <he> liked me, either) sent the 
Hetman a telegram: "Please find some more reporters like that 
young man from Denver". Watson showed this wire to Colonel Van Hamm. 
The colonel grunted, then made a remark which might be construed 
in either of two ways. "Don't bother to look any further. We already 
<have> the only one of its kind".   The Hetman did have 
friends, but they were mostly outside the newspaper profession. Sergeant 
Mike Donaldson, Congressional Medal of Honor soldier, was 
one of them. Dr& Menas S& Gregory was another. I used to go 
with Watson to call on the eminent neurologist at his apartment, to sit 
among the doctor's excellent collection of statues, paintings, and 
books and drink Oriental coffee while Watson seemed to thaw out and 
become almost affable.   There was one time, however, when his 
face clouded and he suddenly blurted, "Why did my brother commit 
suicide"?   I cannot remember Dr& Gregory's reply, if, 
indeed, he made one. 
If she were not at home, Mama would see to it that a fresh white rose 
was there. Sometimes, Mrs& Coolidge would close herself in the 
Green Suite on the second floor, and play the piano she had brought 
to the White House. Mama knew she was playing her son's favorite 
pieces and feeling close to him, and did not disturb her.   All 
the rest of the days in the White House would be shadowed by the tragic 
loss, even though the President tried harder than ever to make his 
little dry jokes and to tease the people around him.   A little 
boy came to give the President his personal condolences, and the President 
gave word that any little boy who wanted to see him was to be 
shown in. Backstairs, the maids cried a little over that, and the standing 
invitation was not mentioned to Mrs& Coolidge.   The 
President was even more generous with the First Lady than he had been 
before the tragedy. He would bring her boxes of candy and other presents 
to coax a smile to her lips.   He brought her shawls. Dresses 
were short in the days of Mrs& Coolidge, and Spanish shawls 
were thrown over them. He got her dozens of them. One shawl was so 
tremendous that she could not wear it, so she draped it over the banister 
on the second floor, and it hung over the stairway. The President 
used to look at it with a ghost of a smile.   Mrs& Coolidge 
spent more time in her bedroom among her doll collection. She kept 
the dolls on the Lincoln bed. At night, when Mama would turn back the 
covers, she would have to take all the dolls off the bed and place 
them elsewhere for the night. Mama always felt that the collection symbolized 
Mrs& Coolidge's wish for a little girl.   Among the 
dolls was one that meant very much to the First Lady, who would pick 
it up and look at it often. It had a tiny envelope tied to its wrist. 
An accompanying sympathetic letter explained that inside the envelope 
was a name for Mrs& Coolidge's first granddaughter. Mama 
knew this doll was meant to help Mrs& Coolidge overcome her grief 
by turning her eyes to the future. The name inside the envelope was "Cynthia".

The Coolidges' life, after the death of their 
son, was quieter than ever. John was away at school most of the time. 
Mrs& Coolidge would knit, and the President would sit reading, 
or playing with the many pets around them.   Now and then, the 
President would call for "Little Jack, Master of the Hounds", 
which was his nickname for a messenger who had worked in the White House 
since Teddy Roosevelt's administration, and discuss the welfare 
of some one of the animals. It was part of Little Jack's work 
to look after the dogs.   One White House dog was immortalized 
in a painting. That was Rob Roy, who posed with Mrs& Coolidge 
for the portrait by Howard Chandler Christy. To get him to pose, 
Mrs& Coolidge would feed him candy, so he enjoyed the portrait sessions 
as well as she did.   I would like to straighten out a misconception 
about the dress Mrs& Coolidge is wearing in this painting. 
It is not the same dress as the one on her manikin in the Smithsonian. 
People think the dress in the picture was lengthened by an artist 
much later on. This is not true. The dress in the painting is a 
bright red, with rhinestones forming a spray on the right side. There 
is a long train flowing from the shoulders.   Mrs& Coolidge 
gave Mama this dress for me, and I wore it many times. I still have 
the dress, and I hope to give it to the Smithsonian Institution 
as a memento, or, as I more fondly hope, to present it to a museum containing 
articles showing the daily lives of the Presidents- if I 
can get it organized.   But to get back to the Coolidge household, 
Mrs& Coolidge so obviously loved dogs, that the public sent her 
more dogs- Calamity Jane, Timmy, and Blackberry. The last two 
were a red and a black chow. Rob Roy remained boss of all the dogs. 
He showed them what to do, and taught them how to keep the maids around 
the White House in a state of terror.   The dogs would run 
through the halls after him like a burst of bullets, and all the maids 
would run for cover. Mama didn't know what to do- whether to tell 
on Rob Roy or not- since she had the ear of Mrs& Coolidge 
more than the other maids. But she was afraid the First Lady would 
not understand, because Rob Roy was a perfect angel with the First 
Family.   Every day, when the President took his nap, Rob Roy 
would stretch out on the window seat near him, like a perfect gentleman, 
and stare thoughtfully out the window, or he would take a little 
nap himself. He would not make a sound until the President had wakened 
and left for the office; then he would bark to let everyone know 
the coast was clear. His signal was for the other dogs to come running, 
but it was also the signal for Mama and the other maids to watch 
out.   Rob Roy was self-appointed to accompany the President to 
his office every morning. Rob Roy was well aware of the importance 
of this mission, and he would walk in front of the President, looking 
neither to the right nor to the left.   At dinner, lunch, or breakfast, 
the President would call out, "Supper"!- he called 
all meals supper- after the butler had announced the meal. All the 
dogs would dash to get on the elevator with the President and go to 
the dining room. They would all lie around on the rug during the meal, 
a very pretty sight as Rob Roy, Prudence, and Calamity Jane were 
all snow-white.   When Prudence and Blackberry were too young 
to be trusted in the dining room, they were tied to the radiator with 
their leashes, and they would cry. Mama tried to talk to them and keep 
them quiet while she tidied up the sitting room before the First 
Family returned.   Finally, Mama did mention to Mrs& Coolidge 
that she felt sorry for the little dogs, and then Mrs& Coolidge 
decided to leave the radio on for them while she was gone, even though 
her husband disapproved of the waste of electricity.   Mama was 
now the first maid to Mrs& Coolidge, because Catherine, the previous 
first maid, had become ill and died. Mrs& Coolidge chose Mama 
in her place. It was a high mark for Mama.   Every First 
Family seems to have one couple upon whom it relies for true friendship. 
For the Coolidges, it was Mr& and Mrs& Frank W& Stearns 
of Boston, Massachusetts, owners of a large department store. They 
seemed to be at the White House half the time. The butlers were 
amused because when the Stearns were there, the President would say 
grace at breakfast. If the Stearns were not there, grace would be omitted.

Speaking of breakfast, the President inaugurated a new 
custom- that of conducting business at the breakfast table. The word 
was that this too was part of an economy move on his part. A new bill 
had been passed under Harding that designated the Government, rather 
than the President, as the tab-lifter for official meals. So the 
President would make a hearty breakfast official by inviting Government 
officials to attend.   He caused a lot of talk when he also 
chose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim his hair 
while he ate. Mama said that if Presidents were supposed to be colorful, 
Mr& Coolidge certainly made a good president. He knew exactly 
how to be colorful!   The favorite guest of the house, as 
far as the staff was concerned, was Mr& Wrigley, the chewing gum king. 
The White House had chewing gum until it could chew no more, and 
every Christmas, Mr& Wrigley sent the President a check for $100, 
to be divided among all the help. You can imagine that he got pretty 
good service.   Another good friend of the Coolidges' was 
George B& Harvey, who was the Ambassador to Great Britain from 
1921 to 1923. He had been a friend of the Hardings, and continued 
to be invited by the Coolidges.   The first royalty whom Mama 
ever waited on in the White House was Queen Marie of Rumania, 
who came to a State dinner given in her honor on October 21, 1926. 
She was not an overnight guest in the White House, but Mr& Ike
