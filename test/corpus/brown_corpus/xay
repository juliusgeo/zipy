He was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday 
by Traffic Judge George T& Murphy, who continued his no-driving 
probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit 
House of Correction. The jail sentence is to begin the day 
after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June.

The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today.

Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree 
tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire. 

#HELP ASKED#

In Vientiane, 
the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its "friends and 
neighbors" for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive 
threatening the southeast Asian kingdom.   Britain's plans 
to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in 
London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home.   He said Britain also 
proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened, 
sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.

A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5, 
he said. 

#PLEA FOR ARMS#

The Laos government plea for help was 
made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana. He indicated that requests 
would be made for more U&S& arms and more U&S& military 
advisers.   He declared the government is thinking of asking 
for foreign troops if the situation worsens.   One of the first 
moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States 
to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the 
current civilian body.   A note making the request was handed to 
U&S& Ambassador Winthrop G& Brown. 

#HEAVY SUPPORT#

The 
Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been 
launched, heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam.

The minister, describing the attacks which led up to the 
appeal, said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal 
army troops on one front- near Thakhek, in southern-central Laos.

There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent 
sources. In the past such government claims have been found 
exaggerated. 

_HAVANA, APRIL 19._- Two Americans and seven Cubans were executed 
by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing 
the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators.

A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans 
as Howard Anderson and August Jack McNair.   The executions 
took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their 
conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar del Rio, where the 
executions took place. 

#ARMS PLOT CHARGED#

The broadcast said 
Anderson, a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman, and McNair, 
of Miami, were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.

Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations 
and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded 
since the start of Fidel Castro's regime.   Anderson's 
wife and four children live in Miami.   McNair, 25, was seized 
March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload 
of rifles in Pinar del Rio, about 35 miles from Havana. 

#REPORT 
OTHERS HELD#

At least 20 other Americans were reported to have 
been arrested in a mass political roundup.   Among them were a 
number of newsmen, including Henry Raymont, of United Press International, 
and Robert Berrellez, of Associated Press.   So many 
Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the 
massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted 
into makeshift jails. More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested- 
100 of them Roman Catholic priests.

Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in 
Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state, few emerge in the 
West to tell about it.   M& Kegham- the name is a pseudynom- 
was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary 
Federation (~ARF)- two reasons the Communists put 
him 
away when they arrived in 1945.   Today, M& Kegham was in Detroit, 
en route to join his wife and children in California.

Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that 
it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's 
tax laws made such a step possible.   "Emory University's 
charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of 
students on the basis of race", board chairman Henry L& Bowden 
stated.   But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory 
board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements 
at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes.   The statement 
explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law, 
tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they 
are segregated.   "Emory could not continue to operate according 
to its present standards as an institution of higher learning, of 
true university grade, and meet its financial obligations, without the 
tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it 
conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions", 
the statement said.   The statement did not mention what steps 
might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.

An Emory spokesman indicated, however, that the university itself 
did not intend to make any test of the laws.   The Georgia 
Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from 
property taxation if, among other criteria, "all endowments to institutions 
established for white people shall be limited to white people, 
and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall 
be limited to colored people".   At least two private colleges 
in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student 
bodies, but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the 
state.   Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church. Some 
church leaders, both clerical and lay, have criticized the university 
for not taking the lead in desegregation. 

#URGED IN 1954#

The student 
newspaper, The Emory Wheel, as early as the fall of 1954 called 
for desegregation.   "From its beginning", the trustees' 
statement said Friday, "Emory University has assumed as its primary 
commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning. 
Teaching, research and study, according to highest standards, under 
Christian influence, are paramount in the Emory University policy.

"As a private institution, supported by generous individuals, 
Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no 
policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in 
scholarship and Christian education.   "There is not now, nor 
has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any 
requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race, 
color or creed. Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned, 
Emory University could now consider applications from prospective 
students, and others 
seeking applications from prospective students, 
and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university, 
irrespective of race, color or creed. 

#CORPORATE EXISTENCE#

"On 
the other hand, Emory University derives its corporate existence from 
the State of Georgia. **h   "When and if it can do so without 
jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges 
essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities, 
Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring 
to study or work at the University without regard to race, color or 
creed, continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered 
on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria 
designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university 
and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian 
higher education".

A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday 
when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue 
near Waddell Street, ~NE, police said.   The dead youth 
was identified as Robert E& Sims, 19, of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir&, 
~SE.   Patrolman G& E& Hammons said the car evidently 
slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the 
pole.   The other occupants were James Willard Olvey, 18, of 
963 Ponce de Leon Ave&, ~NE, and Larry Coleman Barnett, 19, 
of 704 Hill St&, ~SE, both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital 
for severe lacerations and bruises.

The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie 
theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and "stand-ins" 
if negotiations failed.   The demands were set forth in 
letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal 
for Human Rights. #'INTEND TO ATTEND'#

"We intend to 
attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year", the identically 
worded letters said.   The letters set a Nov& 15 deadline 
for the start of negotiations. They indicated that stand-ins and 
picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate.

Downtown and art theater managers and owners, contacted Friday 
night for comment on the ~COAHR request, said they had no knowledge 
of such a letter, and that it was not in the Friday mail. However, 
three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the 
proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend. 

#GATHER 
HERE#

The ~COAHR letter comes on the eve of a large gathering 
of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday. 
Several theater operators said, however, that there is little likelihood 
of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair.
