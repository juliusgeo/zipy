_MR& DOOLEY._ Mr& Speaker, for several years now the commuter 
railroads serving our large metropolitan areas have found it increasingly 
difficult to render the kind of service our expanding population 
wants and is entitled to have. The causes of the decline of the commuter 
railroads are many and complex- high taxes, losses of revenue to 
Government subsidized highway and air carriers, to name but two. And 
the solutions to the problems of the commuter lines have been equally 
varied, ranging all the way from Government ownership to complete 
discontinuance of this important service.   There have been a number 
of sound plans proposed. But none of these has been implemented. 
Instead we have stood idly by, watched our commuter railroad service 
decline, and have failed to offer a helping hand. Though the number 
of people flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas each day has increased 
tremendously since World War /2,, total annual rail commutation 
dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957. Nowhere has this decline 
been more painfully evident than in the New York City area. Here the 
New York Central Railroad, one of the Nation's most important 
carriers, has alone lost 47.6 percent of its passengers since 1949.

At this time of crisis in our Nation's commuter railroads, 
a new threat to the continued operations of the New York Central has 
appeared in the form of the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad's proposal 
for control of the Baltimore + Ohio railroads.   The New York 
Central has pointed out that this control, if approved by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, would give the combined C& + O&-B& 
+ O& Railroad a total of 185 points served in common with the 
New York Central. Not only is this kind of duplication wasteful, 
but it gives the combined system the ability to take freight traffic 
away from the New York Central and other railroads serving the area.

The New York Central notes: "  The freight traffic 
most susceptible to raiding by the C& + O&-B& + O& provides 
the backbone of Central's revenues. These revenues make it 
possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire 
New York Central system as well as the New York area commuter 
and terminal freight services. If these services are to be maintained, 
the New York Central must have the revenues to make them possible".

The New York Central today handles 60 percent of all 
southbound commuter traffic coming into New York City. This is a 
$14 million operation involving 3,500 employees who work on commuter 
traffic exclusively. A blow to this phase of the Central's operations 
would have serious economic consequences not only to the railroad 
itself, but to the 40,000 people per day who are provided with efficient, 
reasonably priced transportation in and out of the city. " 
There is a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful 
C& + O&-B& + O& merger scheme"-   The Central 
has pointed out. "  The logic of creating a strong, balanced, 
competitive two-system railroad service in the East is so obvious 
that B& + O& was publicly committed to the approach outlined here.

Detailed studies of the plan were well underway. Though 
far from completion, these studies indicated beyond a doubt that savings 
would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroads 
concerned, their investors, their customers, their users, and to the 
public at large.   Then, abandoning the studies in the face of 
their promising outlook for all concerned, B& + O& entered on-again-off-again 
negotiations with C& + O& which resulted in the present 
situation.   In the light of the facts at hand, however, 
New York Central intends to pursue the objective of helping to create 
a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest".

The Interstate Commerce Commission will commence its 
deliberations on the proposed C& + O&-B& + O& merger on 
June 18. Obviously, the Interstate Commerce Commission will not force 
the New York Central to further curtail its commuter operations 
by giving undue competitive advantages to the lines that wish to merge.

However, there is a more profound consideration to this proposed 
merger than profit and loss. That is, will it serve the long-range 
public interest?   For the past 40 years Congress has advocated 
a carefully planned, balanced and competitive railway system. 
We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives will help the commuter- 
the two-way B& + O&-C& + O& merger, or the three-way 
New York Central-B& + O&-C& + O& merger. Which will 
serve not only the best interest of the stockholders, but the interests 
of all the traveling public? 
_MR& LINDSAY._ Mr& Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to
