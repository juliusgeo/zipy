legislator, this great Texan, this great American.   My sincere 
wish is that he continues to add to this record he sets here today. 

#REMARKS OF HON& JOHN S& MONAGAN OF CONNECTICUT#

_MR& MONAGAN._ 
SAM RAYBURN is one of the greatest American public figures 
in the history of our country and I consider that I have been 
signally honored in the privilege of knowing SAM RAYBURN and sharing 
with him the rights and obligations of a Member of the House of 
Representatives in the Congress of the United States.   Others 
may speak of Speaker RAYBURN'S uniquely long and devoted 
service; of his championship of many of the progressive social measures 
which adorn our statute books today, and of his cooperation in times 
of adversity with Presidents of both of our major parties in helping 
to pilot the Ship of State through the shoals of today's stormy 
international seas.   I prefer to speak, however, of SAM RAYBURN, 
the person, rather than SAM RAYBURN, the American institution.

Although SAM RAYBURN affects a gruff exterior in 
many instances, nevertheless he is fundamentally a man of warm heart 
and gentle disposition. No one could be more devoted than he to the 
American Congress as an institution and more aware of its historical 
significance in the political history of the world, and I shall never 
forget his moving talks, delivered in simple yet eloquent words, upon 
the meaning of our jobs as Representatives in the operation of representative 
government and their importance in the context of today's 
assault upon popular government.   Above all, he is a person to 
whom a fledgling Representative can go to discuss the personal and professional 
problems which inevitably confront a new Congressman. In 
this role of father confessor, he has always been most characteristic 
and most helpful.   On September 16, SAM RAYBURN will have 
served as Speaker twice as long as any predecessor and I am proud 
to join with others in marking this date, and in expressing my esteem 
for that notable American, SAM RAYBURN. 
_ORIGIN OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES._ The practice of state-owned 
vehicles for use of employees on business dates back over forty years. 
At least one state vehicle was in existence in 1917.   The 
state presently owns 389 passenger vehicles in comparison to approximately 
200 in 1940.   The automobile maintenance unit, or motor pool, 
came into existence in 1942 and has been responsible for centralized 
maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that 
time.   The motor pool has made exceptional progress in automotive 
management including establishment of cost billing systems, records 
keeping, analyses of vehicle use, and effecting economies in vehicle 
operation. Cars were operated in 1959 for an average .027@ per mile.

Purchase of state vehicles is handled similarly to all state 
purchases. Unit prices to the state are considerably lower than to 
the general public because of quantity purchases and no payment of state 
sales or federal excise taxes. _VEHICLE PURCHASE, ASSIGNMENT AND 
USE POLICIES._ The legislature's role in policy determination concerning 
state-owned vehicles has been confined almost exclusively to 
appropriating funds for vehicles.   The meaningful policies governing 
the purchase, assignment, use and management of state vehicles have 
been shaped by the state's administrative officers.   Meaningful 
policies include: (a) kinds of cars the state should own, (b) 
when cars should be traded, (c) the need and assignment of vehicles, 
(d) use of cars in lieu of mileage allowances, (e) employees taking cars 
home, and (f) need for liability insurance on state automobiles.

A review of these policies indicates: _(1)_ The state purchases 
and assigns grades of cars according to need and position status 
of driver and use of vehicle. _(2)_ The purchase of compact (economy) 
cars is being made currently on a test basis. _(3)_ Cars 
are traded mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy. _(4)_ 
The factors governing need and assignment of cars are flexible 
according to circumstances. _(5)_ Unsuccessful efforts have been 
made to replace high mileage allowances with state automobiles. _(6)_ 
It is reasonably economical for the state to have drivers garage 
state cars at their homes. _(7)_ The state has recently undertaken 
liability insurance for drivers of state cars. _AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES 
IN OTHER STATES._ A survey of practices and/or policies in other 
states concerning assignment and use of state automobiles reveals 
several points for comparison with Rhode Island's practices.

Forty-seven states assign or provide vehicles for employees on state 
business. Two other states provide vehicles, but only with legislative 
approval.   States which provide automobiles for employees 
assign them variously to the agency, the individual, or to a central pool.

Twenty-six states operate a central motor pool for acquisition, 
allocation and/or maintenance of state-owned vehicles. 
Nineteen states report laws, policies or regulations for assigning state 
vehicles in lieu of paying mileage allowances. Of these states the 
average "change-over" point (at which a car is substituted for allowances) 
is 13,200 miles per year. _MILEAGE ALLOWANCES._ Mileage 
allowances for state employees are of two types: (a) actual mileage 
and (b) fixed monthly allowances.   Actual mileage allowances 
are itemized reimbursements allowed employees for the use of personally-owned 
vehicles on state business at the rate of .07@ per mile. Fixed 
monthly allowances are reimbursements for the same purpose except 
on a non-itemized basis. Both allowances are governed by conditions and 
restrictions set forth in detail in the state's Travel Regulations.

Rhode Island's reimburseable rate of .07@ per mile for 
use of personally-owned cars compares favorably with other states' 
rates. The average of states' rates is .076@ per mile. 
Rhode Island's rate of .07@ per mile is considerably lower than 
reimburseable rates in the federal government and in industry nationally 
which approximate a .09@ per mile average.   Actual mileage 
allowances are well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state. 
The travel regulations, requirements and procedures governing reimbursement 
are controlled properly and not overly restrictive. 
Fixed monthly allowances are a controversial subject. They have a great 
advantage in ease of audit time and payment. However, they lend themselves 
to abuse and inadequate control measures. Flat payments over 
$50 per month are more expensive to the state than the assignment of 
state-owned vehicles. _TRAVEL ALLOWANCES._ Travel allowances, including 
subsistence, have been revised by administrative officials recently 
and compare favorably with other states' allowances. With few 
exceptions travelers on state business are allowed actual travel expenses 
and $15 per day subsistence. Travel allowances are well-regulated 
and pose little problem in administration and/or audit control. 

#ORIGIN 
OF STATE AUTOMOBILE PRACTICES#

_GENERAL BACKGROUND._ It 
is difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchasing automobiles 
for use of employees in Rhode Island. Few records are available 
concerning the subject prior to 1940. Those that are available 
shed little light. The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that 
at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917. It 
should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles 
is at least forty years old.   The best reason that can be 
advanced for the state adopting the practice was the advent of expanded 
highway construction during the 1920s and '30s. At that time highway 
engineers traveled rough and dirty roads to accomplish their duties. 
Using privately-owned vehicles was a personal hardship for such employees, 
and the matter of providing state transportation was felt perfectly 
justifiable.   Once the principle was established, the increase 
in state-owned vehicles came rapidly. And reasons other than employee 
need contributed to the growth. Table 1 immediately below shows 
the rate of growth of vehicles and employees. This rate of increase 
does not signify anything in itself. It does not indicate loose management, 
ineffective controls or poor policy. But it does show that automobiles 
have increased steadily over the years and in almost the same 
proportion to the increase of state employees. In the past twenty 
years the ratio of state-owned automobiles per state employees has varied 
from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now. Whether there were too few automobiles 
in 1940 or too many now is problematical. The fact is simply 
that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion 
as employees to use them. _HISTORY AND OPERATION OF THE MOTOR 
POOL._ While the origin of state-owned automobiles may be obscured, 
subsequent developments concerning the assignment, use, and management 
of state automobiles can be related more clearly. Prior to 1942, 
automobiles were the individual responsibility of the agency to which 
assigned. This responsibility included all phases of management. It 
embraced determining when to purchase and when to trade vehicles, who 
was to drive, when and where repairs were to be made, where gasoline 
and automobile services were to be obtained and other allied matters. 
In 1942, however, the nation was at war. Gasoline and automobile tires 
were rationed commodities. The state was confronted with transportation 
problems similar to those of the individual. It met these problems 
by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit (more popularly 
called the motor pool), a centralized operation for the maintenance 
and control of all state transportation. The motor pool then, 
as now, had headquarter facilities in Providence and other garages located 
throughout the state. It was organizationally the responsibility 
of the Department of Public Works and was financed on a rotary fund 
basis with each agency of government contributing to the pool's operation. 
In 1951 the pool's operation was transferred to the newly-created 
Department of Administration, an agency established as the 
central staff and auxiliary department of the state government. The management 
of state-owned vehicles since that time has been described in 
a recent report in the following manner: "  Under this new 
management considerable progress appears to have been made. The agencies 
of government are now billed for the actual cost of services provided 
to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all 
cars. Whereas the maintenance rotary fund had in the past sustained 
losses considerably beyond expectations, the introduction of the cost-billing 
system plus other control refinements has resulted in keeping 
the fund on a proper working basis. One indication of the merits of 
the new management is found in the fact that during the period 1951-1956, 
while total annual mileage put on the vehicles increased 35%, the 
total maintenance cost increased only 11%. "  In order 
to further refine the management of passenger vehicles, on July 1, 1958, 
the actual title to every vehicle was transferred, by Executive 
Order, to the Division of Methods, Research and Office Services. 
The objective behind this action was to place in one agency the responsibility 
for the management, assignment, and replacement of all vehicles. 
(Note: So far as State Police cars are concerned, only their 
replacement is under this division). This tied in closely with the 
current attempt to upgrade state-owned cars to the extent that vehicles 
are not retained beyond the point where maintenance costs (in light 
of depreciation) become excessive. Moreover, it allows the present management 
to reassign vehicles so that mileage will be more uniformly 
distributed throughout the fleet; for example, if one driver puts on 
22,000 miles per year and another driver 8,000 miles per year, their 
cars will be switched so that both cars will have 30,000 miles after two 
years, rather than 44,000 miles (and related higher maintenance costs) 
and 16,000 miles respectively".   The motor pool is a completely 
centralized and mechanized operation. It handles all types of 
vehicle maintenance, but concentrates more on "service station activities" 
than on extensive vehicle repairs. It contracts with outside 
repair garages for much of the latter work. Where the pool excels is 
in its compilation of maintenance and cost-data studies and analyses. 
Pool records reveal in detail the cost per mile and miles per gallon 
of each vehicle, the miles traveled in one year or three years, the periods
