A faculty committee on athletics, responsible to the faculty 
as a whole, exercises control over the athletic program of the College. 
It concerns itself with: _1._ The policies which govern 
the program _2._ The preservation of desirable balance between 
the athletic and academic programs of the College _3._ The approval 
of athletic schedules _4._ The maintenance of Midwest Conference 
eligibility standards   Carleton is a member of the Midwest 
Collegiate Athletic Conference and abides by its eligibility rules. 
In addition to these rules, Carleton has added the following: 
_1._ A student who while in attendance at Carleton College participates 
in an athletic contest during the school year, other than that 
sponsored by the College, shall be permanently ineligible to participate 
in intercollegiate athletics at Carleton College and will also 
face permanent suspension from the institution. The school year does 
not end for any student until he has completed his last examination 
of the semester. _2._ A student to be eligible for the captaincy 
of any Carleton team must have a scholastic record of at least 1.00.

THE "~C" CLUB is composed of the men of the College 
who have won an official letter in Carleton athletics. The purpose 
of the Club is to promote better athletic teams at Carleton and to 
increase interest in them among the student body. This is done by encouraging 
the entire male student body to participate in either the intercollegiate 
or intramural sports program and by sponsoring the Carleton 
cheerleaders. _SOCCER CLUB._ The Soccer Club was organized 
by undergraduate men interested in playing soccer and promoting the sport. 
Membership consists of both beginners and experienced players. Practices 
are held regularly and the schedule of games is prepared by 
the student coach and the officers of the club. _WOMEN'S RECREATION 
ASSOCIATION._ This Association, organized in 1920, is affiliated 
with the Athletic Federation of College Women. The purpose of the 
organization is to further the interest of women students in recreational 
activities as a means of promoting physical efficiency, sportsmanship, 
and "play for play's sake". The Association is governed 
by a board made up of representatives from each of the four classes. 
Membership is open to any woman student in the College. Active groups 
sponsored by the organization include the Saddle Club, Orchesis, 
Golf Club, Tennis Club, and Dolphins. The Saddle Club, open to 
students proficient in horsemanship, presents the Annual Spring Riding 
Exhibition, and during the year it offers speakers, movies, breakfast 
rides, and trips to broaden their knowledge of the sport. Orchesis, 
for students interested in the modern dance, contributes to the 
May Fete and offers earlier in the year a modern dance demonstration. 
Tennis Club participates in a dual tennis tournament with the University 
of Minnesota each fall, and also sponsors a two-day state invitational 
tennis meet at Carleton in May. The Dolphins present a 
three-night 
water show the week of the May Fete. Under the auspices of 
the Women's Recreation Association, interclass competition is organized 
in badminton, basketball, field hockey, golf, tennis, and swimming. 
The Association participates in the winter sports carnival and 
sponsors several Play Days with St& Olaf and other near-by colleges. 
With the co-operation of the Department of Physical Education 
for Men, the Women's Recreation Association arranges mixed tournaments 
in tennis and golf in the fall and spring. Throughout the year 
there are social events, such as picnics, breakfast hikes, canoe trips, 
banquets, and indoor parties. 

#COLLEGE PUBLICATIONS#

IN ADDITION 
to the miscellaneous pamphlets and other printed matter which 
it issues, the College maintains regular publications, as follows:

<The Bulletin,> in five issues: <The Report of the 
President> in August; <The Alumni Fund Report> in September; 
the annual <Catalog> in March; an <Alumni Reunion Bulletin> 
in April; and a special <Bulletin> in June. The College 
also publishes each year <The Report of the Treasurer> and a monthly 
newsletter entitled <Carleton College Comments>. In co-operation 
with the Alumni Association of Carleton College, an alumni magazine, 
<The Voice of the Carleton Alumni,> is edited and mailed 
seven times a year by the College's Publications Office and the 
Alumni Office. At intervals an alumni directory is issued. 
These publications may be secured as follows: The annual <Catalog> 
from the Director of Admissions and other issues from the Publications 
Office.   In January, 1960, the first issue of <The 
Carleton Miscellany,> a quarterly literary magazine, was published 
by the College. The magazine, edited by members of the Carleton Department 
of English, includes contributions by authors from both within 
and beyond the Carleton community. 

#STUDENT PUBLICATIONS#

<The 
Carletonian,> the college newspaper, is edited by students and published 
by the College under the supervision of the Publications Board. 
(See page 100.) It is issued weekly throughout the college year. 
The Publications Board holds annual competitive examinations for 
places on the editorial and business staffs. The editor, sports editor, 
and student business manager are chosen in December, the new staff 
assuming responsibility for the paper at the beginning of the second 
semester. The paper affords excellent practice for students interested 
in the field of journalism.   <The Algol,> the college annual, 
is published in the fall of each year. <The Algol> serves as a 
record of campus organizations and student activities during the year. 
The Publications Board receives applications for the positions of 
editor and business manager and makes the appointments in the spring 
previous to the year of publication. Members of <The Algol> staff 
are nominated by the editor and business manager and appointed by the 
Publications Board.   <Manuscript,> a quarterly literary magazine, 
is published by the students of the College. It is the purpose 
of this magazine to serve as an outlet for student creative writing. 
The editor and business manager of <Manuscript> are appointed by 
the Publications Board. 

#CAMPUS BROADCASTING STATION#

A LOW-POWER, 
"carrier-current" broadcasting station, ~KARL, heard 
only in the campus dormitories, is owned and operated by the students 
to provide an outlet for student dramatic, musical, literary, technical, 
and other talents, and to furnish information, music, and entertainment 
for campus listeners. Over a hundred students participate in 
the planning and production of the daily program schedule. ~KARL 
provides experience for students who wish to pursue careers in radio. 

#STUDENT GOVERNMENT#

THE CARLETON STUDENT ASSOCIATION includes 
all students in college and is intended "to work for the betterment 
of Carleton College by providing student government and student 
participation with the college administration in the formulation and execution 
of policies which pertain to student life and activities".

THE CARLETON SOCIAL CO-OPERATIVE is a standing committee 
of the Carleton Student Association. Week-end activities for the entire 
campus are planned by the Co-op Board.

In recent months, much attention has been given to the probable 
extent of the current downtrend in business and economists are somewhat 
divided as to the outlook for the near future. And yet, despite some 
disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new 
decade, 1960 has been a good year in many ways, with many overall measures 
of business having reached new peaks for the year as a whole. The 
shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the 
present mood of caution has probably been a good thing, in that it has 
prevented the accumulation of the burdensome inventories that have characterized 
many previous swings in the business cycle. This caution 
has been particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailers and distributors 
to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier, and the fact 
stocks at retail are low in many lines has escaped attention because 
of the presence of higher stocks at the manufacturing level.   In 
the electronics industry, this tendency is well illustrated by inventories 
of ~TV sets. Factory stocks in recent months have been the 
highest they have been in three years, while those at retail are below 
1959. The total value of our industry's shipments, at factory prices, 
increased from $9.2 billion in 1959 to approximately $10.1 billion 
as a result of increases in all of the major segments of our business- 
home entertainment, military, industrial, and replacement. I believe 
a further gain is in prospect for 1961. 

#HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES 
UP#

Reflecting the largest percentage of high-end sets such as 
consoles and combinations since 1953, dollar value of home entertainment 
electronics in 1960 was about $1.9 billion, compared to $1.7 billion 
in 1959. Sales of ~TV sets at retail ran ahead of the like months 
of 1959 through July; set production (excluding those destined for 
the export market) also ran ahead in the early months, but was curtailed 
after the usual vacation shutdowns in the face of growing evidence 
that some of the early production plans had been overly optimistic. 
For the year as a whole, retail sales of ~TV sets probably came 
to 5.8 million against 5.7 million in 1959; however, production came 
to only 5.6 million compared to 6.2 million.   In contrast to the 
lower turnout of ~TV, total radio production increased from 15.4 
million sets to 16.7 million (excluding export). Both home and auto 
radios were in excellent demand, with retail sales of home sets ahead 
of 1959 in every month of the first eleven; sales and production of 
home sets were about equal at 10.4 million units. Auto set production 
came to about 6.3 million compared to 5.6 million in 1959. Separate 
phonographs also had a good year, reflecting the growing popularity of 
stereo 
sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade 
that characterized the radio-~TV market.   The outlook 
for entertainment electronics in 1961 is certainly far from clear at present, 
but recent surveys have shown a desire on the part of consumers 
to step up their buying plans for durable goods. I would expect that 
sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 
10-15% but that second-half levels should show a favorable comparison, 
with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business 
conditions recover as some recent forecasts suggest they will. I 
look for ~TV sales and production to be approximately equal at 5.7 
million sets for the year, but I look for some decline in radios from 
the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 15.0-15.5 million 
sets. I therefore believe it is realistic to assume a modest drop 
in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $1.8 
million, slightly below 1960, but above 1959. 

#MILITARY ELECTRONICS 
TO GROW#

1960 witnessed another substantial increase in our industry's 
shipments of military electronics, which totalled about $5.4 billion 
compared to $4.9 billion in 1959. It is interesting to note that 
the present level of military electronics procurement is greater than 
the industry's total sales to all markets in 1950-1953, which were good 
years for our industry with television enjoying its initial period 
of rapid consumer acceptance. It has been correctly pointed out by well-informed
