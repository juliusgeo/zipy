another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible; 
and the motion toward it brings disaster.   This prohibition 
on love has an especially poignant relation to art; it is particularly 
the artist (Tonio Kro^ger, Aschenbach, Leverku^hn) who suffers 
from it. The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem 
of the "breakthrough" in the realm of art.   Again, the sufferings 
and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment 
not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another 
with childhood, with the figure of a child.   Finally, the 
theatrical (and perversely erotic) notions of dressing up, cosmetics, 
disguise, and especially change of costume (or singularity of costume, 
as with Cipolla), are characteristically associated with the catastrophes 
of Mann's stories.   We shall return to these statements 
and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates. 
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of 
Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all these elements come together 
in prophetic parody. Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated 
with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially 
middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself 
dressed up, disguised- that is, paradoxically, revealed- as a 
child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child. That this abandonment 
takes place on a stage, during an 'artistic' performance, 
is enough to associate Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the 
punishment for art; that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable, as 
is anyone in Mann's stories who produces <illusion>, and this is 
true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature, technique, 
magic, guilt and suffering, are divided in this story between Jacoby 
and La^utner.   It appears that the dominant tendency of 
Mann's early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque the surface, 
is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic, the expressionistic. 
In a certain perfectly definite way, the method and the theme of his 
stories are one and the same.   Something of this can be learned 
from "The Way to the Churchyard" (1901), an anecdote about 
an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die 
of a stroke or seizure. There is no more "plot" than that; only 
slightly more, perhaps, than a newspaper account of such an incident 
would give. The artistic interest, then, lies in what the encounter 
may be made to represent, in the power of some central significance 
to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.   The first 
sentence, with its platitudinous irony, announces an emblematic intent: 
"The way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad, ran 
beside it all the way to the end; that is to say, to the churchyard". 
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction. 
The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while 
the way to the churchyard belongs to death. But that is too simple, 
and won't hold up. As the first sentence suggests, both roads belong 
to death in the end. But the highroad, according to the description 
of its traffic, belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death, 
while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life: 
a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in the awareness 
of death. Thus, on the highroad, a troop of soldiers "marched in their 
own dust and sang", while on the footpath one man walks alone.

This man's isolation is not merely momentary, it is permanent. 
He is a widower, his three children are dead, he has no one left on 
earth; also he is a drunk, and has lost his job on that account. His 
name is Praisegod Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to 
his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister 
type in the author's repertory- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic 
strangers in "Death in Venice", for example, who represent 
some combination of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.   This strange 
person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path 
rather than the highroad. The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace 
young fellow, is not named but identified simply as "Life"- that 
and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him. "Life" 
points out that "everybody uses this path", and starts to ride 
on. Piepsam tries to stop him by force, receives a push in the chest 
from "Life", and is left standing in impotent and growing rage, 
while a crowd begins to gather. His rage assumes a religious form; 
that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness, 
Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God 
imprecates doom on Life- not only the cyclist now, but the audience, 
the world, as well: "all you light-headed breed". This passion 
brings on a fit which proves fatal. Then an ambulance comes along, 
and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away.   This is simple enough, 
but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant. The 
season, between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree 
aspect. Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because <he> cannot 
stop the cyclist, but also because God will not stop him; as Piepsam 
says to the crowd in his last moments: "His justice is not of 
this world".   Life is further characterized, in antithesis to 
Piepsam, as animal: the image of a dog, which appears at several 
places, is first given as the criterion of amiable, irrelevant interest 
aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle: a dog in a wagon 
is "admirable", "a pleasure to contemplate"; another wagon 
has no dog, and therefore is "devoid of interest". Piepsam calls 
the cyclist "cur" and "puppy" among other things, and at the crisis 
of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into 
his face. The ambulance is drawn by two "charming" little horses.

Piepsam is not, certainly, religious in any conventional sense. 
His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically, connected with 
his sinfulness; the two may in fact be identical. His unsuccessful 
strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings; 
he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home, and "before this wardrobe Praisegod 
Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees, and in 
his wrestlings had bitten his tongue- and still in the end capitulated".

The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is simply 
unreflective, unproblematic Life, "blithe and carefree". "He 
made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth".

Piepsam is grotesque, a disturbing parody; his end is ridiculous 
and trivial. He is "a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard". 
But he is more interesting than the others, the ones who come from 
the highroad to watch him, more interesting than Life considered 
as a cyclist. And if I have gone into so much detail about so small 
a work, that is because it is also so typical a work, representing the 
germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing: 
the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical, destructive 
and self-destructive tendencies, much that is enlarged and illuminated 
in the figures of, for instance, Naphta and Leverku^hn.

In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details 
selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for "realism", 
anticipates a kind of musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional 
composition, in which, as Leverku^hn says, "there shall be 
nothing unthematic". It resembles, too, pictures such as Du^rer 
and Bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial 
proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a 
proverb, for example, or a deadly sin.   "Gladius Dei" (1902) 
resembles "The Way to the Churchyard" in its representation 
of a conflict between light and dark, between "Life" and a spirit 
of criticism, negation, melancholy, but it goes considerably further 
in characterizing the elements of this conflict.   The monk Savonarola, 
brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background 
of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious 
works displayed in the art-shop of M& Bluthenzweig; in 
particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, 
according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress. Hieronymus, 
like Piepsam, makes his protest quite in vain, and his rejection, though 
not fatal, is ridiculous and humiliating; he is simply thrown out 
of the shop by the porter. On the street outside, Hieronymus envisions 
a holocaust of the vanities of this world, such a burning of artistic 
and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in 
Florence, and prophetically he issues his curse: "<Gladius Dei 
super terram cito et velociter>". 
The "reality" to which they respond is rationally empty and their 
art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and 
empty world. Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.

These polar concerns (imitation vs& formalism) reflect 
a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing 
over a long period of time. The breakdown of classical structures of 
meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations 
of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes. 
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal 
and spiritual qualities, and complete objectification in sub-human and 
quasi-mechanistic powers. The image of the world tends to reflect the 
hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces 
and overwhelming mystery. The image of God has simply disappeared. 
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory 
response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism: 
if man can neither know nor love reality as it is, he can at 
least invent an artistic "reality" which is its own world and which 
can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable 
of being known and worthy of being loved. The person of the artist 
becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by 
the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical 
systems.   Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and 
whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding 
the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually 
exclusive, that they belong together. Without the decay of a 
sense of objective reference (except as the imitation of mystery), the 
stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into 
being. And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves 
insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art, their peculiar 
authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously 
and gives promise that from their very substance, new and valid 
chapters in the philosophy of art may be written. For better or worse 
we cannot regard "imitation" in the arts in the simple mode of 
classical rationalism or detached realism. A broader concept of imitation 
is needed, one which acknowledges that true invention is important, 
that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic 
causal factors out of which it arises. On the other hand, we cannot regard 
artistic invention as pure, uncaused, and unrelated to the times 
in which it occurs. We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from 
the solipsism and futility of pure formalism. Accordingly, it is the 
aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation (which I shall 
call <mimesis> in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of 
imitation) and a new theory of invention (which I shall call <symbol> 
for reasons to be stated hereafter). 

#THE MIMETIC IMAGINATION IN 
THE ARTS#

The word "mimesis" ("imitation") is usually associated 
with Plato and Aristotle. For Plato, "imitation" is twice 
removed from reality, being a poor copy of physical appearance, which 
in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence. All artistic and mythological 
representations, therefore, are "imitations of imitations" and 
are completely superseded by the truth value of "dialectic", the 
proper use of the inquiring intellect. In Plato's judgment, the 
arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young, 
prior to the full development of their intellectual powers. Presupposed 
in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which 
a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating 
to the most sublime wisdom. Aristotle also tended to stratify all 
aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and, 
like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.
