
"Y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast", he said. 
"Milk and sops"! He beat the air with his stick, and it fell from 
his claws and clattered on the stones.   "He's owly today", 
his grand-daughter said wearily, and bent to pick it up. "He's 
got this idea about drying out **h"   "It ain't an idea"!

"If it ain't an idea", she said, "how comes it 
you can drink beer but not water"?   He looked piously to heaven 
and said, "Beer don't affect the tissues none", and the ingenious 
hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave 
him his 
stint of malevolence.   His grand-daughter sighed. "Come 
on, do. The children are eating, and Miss Blackwell's on her way 
somewheres".   "To the graveyard. Who ain't"? 
"Not me. I've got a day's work to do.- You'll be visiting 
Miss Doaty, ma'am"?   Henrietta nodded. How much they 
knew about her!   The woman (she must have been a tiny baby when 
Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm, watching great age grow small) 
answered the nod with her own. "God rest her soul, she was a sweet 
one. Come on now". She put a strong hand under the old man's 
arm and lifted him up, patiently, with the gentle cruelty and necessary 
tyranny that the young show toward the very old. He mumbled at her 
but let himself be led off inside the house, shuffling mightily to make 
it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by 
those who still had their wicked strength.   There was a gabble 
of voices from indoors, young hungry sounds like cats after fish, and 
a burst of swearing from the old man. Henrietta looked down at her 
bouquet, still lively with its color and scent, and set her feet on their 
journey's way again, leaving the village street and crossing the 
first field, Folly dancing ahead of her.   At the edge of the 
field, the wild rolling land took over, dotted with fat round bushes like 
sheep. They were covered with tiny white blossoms, their scant roots 
clawing at the stony ground, and wild birds darted in and about and 
through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry.

The air was full of sounds too but placid ones, a terrestrial humming 
as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky. She felt mindless, 
walking, and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near 
the cemetery, and she caught herself wondering what she would say to 
Doaty.   Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered 
them (how many things had lessened while she was gone away) but 
the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named 
"Dorothy Tredding" seemed suddenly impossible.   She sat 
down on the nearest, fallen with age and gray with sea-damp, her fingers 
tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss. 
The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold, and she wished 
she had brought her parasol, if only to shade Doaty's flowers. A small, 
rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb, the only angel 
in the cemetery.   She remembered, suddenly, a night of savage 
moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia, having dared each 
other, had stolen out of their great safe house and come here, hand in 
hand, hoping and fearing ghosts.

The Momoyama family had come from Miyagi Prefecture, in the 
northeast of the main Japanese island of Honshu, where there are still 
traces of the mysterious Ainu strain. The Ainus were a primitive 
people, already living on the island before the principal ancestors 
of the Japanese came from Southern Asia. Apparently they were of Caucasian 
blood. They had white skins and blue eyes; all their men 
were bearded, and many of their women were beautiful. A pitiful few of 
them are left now, to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing 
their ancient tribal chants, which have the same haunting sadness as 
the laments of the American Indians. Most of them have been assimilated, 
but sometimes a man in Miyagi or Akita prefectures is much more 
hairy than the average Japanese, and occasionally a girl will be strikingly 
lovely, her coloring warmed and improved by a little of the 
tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invaders from the South.   Tommy 
Momoyama was one of these fortunate occasions. She was taller than 
most Japanese girls, and had the exquisitely willowy form of the 
Japanese girl who is lucky enough to be tall. Her nose was higher of 
bridge, her complexion so pale as to be quite susceptible to sunburn, 
and the fish and vegetable diet of her forebears had given her teeth 
that were white and regular and strong. Her mouth, soft and full, was 
something for any man to dream about. She had black eyes, long and 
intriguingly tilted, and the way she walked was melody.   She had 
been in Japan just one week. It was an alien land, and she hated it 
intensely; she was already considering putting in rebellious requests 
for duty at San Diego, Bremerton, the Great Lakes, Pensacola- 
any place the Navy had a hospital- with a threat to resign her commission 
if the request were not granted. Anywhere would be better than 
the land of her ancestors.   There was nothing wrong with her 
job. Tommy had been assigned to the psychopathic ward. There were 
no depressingly serious cases: the ward doctor sometimes teamed up with 
the chaplain to serve as a marriage counselor- sometimes the Navy 
sent people back to the States to preserve a marriage- but mental 
health as a rule was very high. At present the doctor's main concern 
was in seeing to it that Japanese salvage firms were not permitted 
to operate on the hulks of warships sunk too close inshore, because 
the work involved setting off nerve-shattering blasts at all hours. Tommy 
was interested in psychiatry, because there was much an understanding 
nurse could do to help the patients.   But she suffered in 
her 
off-duty hours. Such as now, when she sat at a table in the coffee shop 
at the Officers' Club, having coffee and a hamburger to sustain 
her until dinnertime. She had changed into a cocktail dress, and the 
whole evening should have been before her, but already she was beginning 
to get a tight feeling at the back of her neck. This was one of the Navy's 
crossroads- you find them all around the world. Ships from 
the West Coast rotated on six-month tours of duty with the Seventh 
Fleet, and Yokosuka was the Seventh Fleet's principal port for 
maintenance, upkeep and shore liberty. Sooner or later, all the gray 
Navy ships came in here; if Tommy sat long enough, she would be sure 
to see all the young officers she had met in San Diego and Long 
Beach. And she wanted desperately to see someone she had known back 
there.   She felt, rather than saw, the approach of the good-looking 
young man. He came through from the Fleet Bar, which was stag, 
with the ice cubes tinkling in a glass he carried. When he saw Tommy 
sitting alone, the tinkling sound stopped. He was perhaps a trifle 
tipsy, having been long at sea where drinking is not permitted, and consequently 
out of practice; he wore a brown tweed sports jacket obviously 
tailored in Hong Kong, and he was of an age that marked him as 
a lieutenant. Probably off one of the carriers- an aviator. There 
was a fifty-fifty chance, perhaps, that he would be unmarried, and an 
even more slender chance that his approach would be different. Japan 
did something to a man- and it wasn't just Japan, either, because 
the same thing applied anywhere overseas. It was as if foreign duty 
implied and excused license; it intimated that the folks at home would 
never know about it, and, therefore, why not?   Then the young 
man in the brown sports jacket spoke, and it was no different.

"Harro, girl-san"! he said, turning on what was meant to be 
charm. "You catchee boy-furiendo? Maybe you likee date with me"?

"I beg your pardon"! Tommy said out of her cold 
rage. 
"I don't believe I know you, and I can't understand your 
quaint brand of English- it <was> meant to be English, wasn't 
it"?   The nice-looking young officer fell back on his heels, 
open-mouthed and blushing. At least, he had the decency to blush, 
she thought.   "Oh- I'm sorry! You see, I thought- 
I mean I really had no idea"-   "Oh, yes- you had ideas"! 
Tommy interrupted furiously. "All wrong ones"! Then she 
jerked her thumb toward the door in a very American gesture, and dropped 
into Navy slang. "Take off, fly-boy"!   "Uh- 
sorry"! he muttered, and took off, obviously feeling like a fool. 
The trouble was that there was no lasting satisfaction in this for Tommy. 
She felt like a fool, too.   It hadn't been this way in 
college, or in nurses' training; it wasn't this way in the hospital 
at San Diego. Everybody had accepted her for what she was- a 
very charming girl. Nobody had addressed her in broken English at any 
of those places, nobody had suggested that she wasn't American. 
There are Spanish girls who look like Tommy Momoyama, brunettes with 
a Moorish hint of the Orient in their faces; there are beauties 
from the Balkan states who are similarly endowed, and- back in the 
blessed United States- they were regarded simply as pretty women. 
Now, having been sent halfway around the world on a job she had not 
asked for, Tommy was being humiliated at every turn.   She looked 
around, self-consciously. Four little Japanese waitresses were murdering 
the English language at the counter- Yuki Kobayashi happened 
to be one of them. Everybody but Tommy seemed to think it was charming 
when they called, "Bifutek-san"! for a steak sandwich, or 
"Kohi futotsu"! for one cup of coffee. Two other Japanese girls 
were sitting at the tables, both quite pretty and well groomed. One 
was with a whitehaired and doting lieutenant commander; the other 
was with her American husband and their exceptionally appealing children. 
Seeing these did nothing for Tommy's mood. She told herself 
rebelliously, and with pride, <I am an American!>   And 
so she was, and would remain. But she was learning that so long as she 
was in this country, and wore civilian dress in the Club, there would 
always be transient young men who would approach her with broken English. 
There had been occasions when some of the more experienced had 
even addressed her in what might have been perfectly good Japanese. 
Tommy wouldn't know; after coming to America, her parents had spoken 
only English.   One thing was becoming increasingly sure. 
She had been sent to the wrong place for duty. There was more to service 
in the Navy Nurse Corps than the hours in the ward. One had 
to have friends, and a congenial life in after-duty hours **h. 
Now there was raucous male singing from the Fleet Bar. It was terribly 
off key, and poorly done, and Tommy could never admit to herself 
that male companionship was a very natural and important thing, but all 
at once she felt lonesome and put-upon. She finished her hamburger 
and drank her coffee and paid her check; she got out of the coffee 
shop before the incident could be repeated. Eating while angry had given 
her a slight indigestion. Back in her living quarters at the hospital 
she took bicarbonate of soda, and sulked.   Then, after a while, 
she went to her mirror. It was all true. She certainly looked 
Japanese, and perhaps she could not really blame the young men. And, 
still, they did not have to be so crude in their approach **h. 
There was a letter to write to her mother, and she tried to make its 
tone cheerful. She promised that she would soon take a few day's leave 
and visit the uncle she had never seen, on the island of Oyajima- 
which was not very far from Yokusuka. And tomorrow she would take 
time to shop for the kimono her mother wanted to present to the young 
wife of a faculty member as a hostess gown.   Tommy, of course, 
had never heard of a kotowaza, or Japanese proverb, which says, "Tanin 
yori miuchi", and is literally translated as "Relatives are 
better than strangers".   Actually, this is only another way 
of saying that blood is thicker than water. #/2,#

Doc Doolittle's 
scheduled appearance at captain's mast was a very unusual thing, 
because the discipline dispensed there is ordinarily for the young 
and immature, and a chief is naturally expected to stay off the report. 
But the beer hall riot in Subic had been unusual, too, and Walt Perry 
was convinced that Doc had started it through some expert tactics 
in rabble rousing. Just why anybody should wish to start a riot the 
executive officer didn't know. In his opinion, Doc had not grown 
up.   The lieutenant was not entirely wrong in the belief. There 
had never been a good reason for Doc Doolittle to grow up. He had
