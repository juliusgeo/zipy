do we need bigger and better bombs? I repeat, two wrongs do not 
make a right. @ #'WE TREMBLE NOT'#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ 
Everyone should take time to read Martin Luther's Hymn 
"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God".   Especially the 
first half of the third verse: @ @ 

#OUT OF THE RACE#


_TO 
THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ To our everlasting shame, we led the 
world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the 
first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Having led the world 
in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead 
it out of the race.   Are we to be the master of the atom, or 
will the atom be our master- and destroy us! @ 

#WHY TRUST JAGAN?# 


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just because Cheddi 
Jagan, new boss of British Guiana, was educated in the United States 
is no reason to think he isn't a Red. We have quite a few home-grown 
specimens of our own. If we go all gooey over this newest Castro 
(until he proves he isn't) we've got rocks in our heads. How 
many times must we get burned before we learn? @ 

#RUSSIA AND U&N&# 


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just to remind the Communists 
that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start 
one. The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed 
on both sides. Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets 
of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan, London 
or Pearl Harbor. That is why the United Nations was formed so that 
intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet 
and solve problems without resorting to war.   Russia has showed 
its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the 
world. Why aren't the Soviets expelled from the U&N&? @ 

#BELATED TRIBUTE#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ While 
"better late than never" may have certain merits, the posthumous 
award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold 
strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation. Had 
it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations 
was living, unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in 
pursuing a difficult and, in many ways, thankless task.   According 
to one report, however, Mr& Hammarskjold was considered "too 
controversial" a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last 
spring. Actually, of course, that label "controversial" applied 
only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world 
organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet 
Union.   At Khrushchev's door, therefore, can be placed 
the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves 
to be intimidated. It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a 
coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed. 
As has happened so often in the past, the ability to recognize 
true greatness has been inadequate and tardy. @ #'PEOPLE TO PEOPLE'# 


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ Just a brief note of 
appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver 
Bashir Ahmad for providing a first-class example of "people to people" 
good will. If only this could be done more often- with such 
heartening results- many of the earth's "big problems" would 
shrink to the insignificances they really are.   P& S&. Thanks 
for your good coverage of Ahmad's visit, too! @ 

#EXPRESSWAY 
ANSWER: EAST RIVER DRIVE#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ 
Your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway 
are valuable; however, several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.

One of the problems associated with the expressway 
stems from the basic idea. We shuffle a large percentage of the cars 
across the river twice. They start on the East side of the Schuylkill, 
have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over 
again to the East at their destination. Bridges, tunnels and ferries 
are the most common methods of river crossings. Each one of these 
is, by its nature, a focal point or a point of natural congestion. We 
should avoid these congestion points or, putting it another way, keep 
cars starting and ending on the East side of the river- on the East 
side.   This can be accomplished by several logical steps: 
_(1)_ Widen the East River Drive at least one lane. _(2)_ 
So widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage 
problems. _(3)_ Paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead 
directional lights as on our bridges. One additional lane would then 
be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the 
traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent. 
_(4)_ This could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures 
necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying 
the natural beauty of the East River Drive. @ 

#SHADOW OVER 
WASHINGTON SQUARE#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ I wish 
to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square: _1._ Take 
away George Washington's statue. _2._ Replace it with the 
statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators.   There's 
no sense in being reminded of times that were. Washington Square seems 
not part of a free land. It may remind one of Russia, China or 
East Berlin; but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington 
and the Continental soldiers fought for.   The Fairmount 
Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals, because it 
is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square. 
The matter may seem a small thing to some people, I know, but it's 
a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism **h The Commission 
has posted signs in Washington Square saying:   {The 
Feeding of Birds is Prohibited in This Square.}   <Fairmount 
Park Commission>   Does each tentacle of the octopus of 
City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers 
an annoyance? If birds don't belong in a Square or Park, what 
does? They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of Nature. 
The trees are their homes; but the Commission does not share 
such sentiments.   The whole official City apparently has an 
intense hatred toward birds. Starlings and blackbirds are scared off 
by cannon, from City Hall. Just a preliminary measure. If any are 
left, presently, we may expect to see signs specifically {PROHIBITING} 
the feeding of them too.   The City Government is not 
united in an all-out, to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs, delinquents, 
thugs, murderers, rapists, subversives. Indeed no. Let every 
policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe, lest one 
piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.   Of 
course, in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and 
innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them 
and afraid to protest and say "How come? What's your motive? 
{WHO} wants this deed done"?- in this small way do 
the leaders of a city, or of a nation, iniure the masses to watching, 
or even inflicting, torture and death, upon even their fellow men.

One means to help the birds occurs to me: Let the chimes that 
ring over Washington Square twice daily, discontinue any piece of music 
but one. Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody 
has been the joy of mankind since time began, the hymn "Abide With 
Me". We will know, and He will know, to whom it is rendered, what 
the birds would ask: @ @ 

#NOT PUSH-UPS BUT STAND-UPS#


_TO 
THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ There is a trend today to bemoan 
the fact that Americans are too "soft". Unfortunately, those who 
would remedy our "softness" seek to do so with calisthenics. They 
are working on the wrong part of our anatomy. It is not our bodies 
but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft. Ashamed of our wealth 
and power, afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace, 
we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.

When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which 
we know to be right, when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations 
which do not permit self-determination, when we become strong enough 
to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation, when 
we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war, and when we realize 
that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom, then, 
and only then will we no longer be "soft". America doesn't need 
to "push-up", she needs to stand up! @ 

#DISPUTES STANS COLUMN BUSINESS SCANDAL VIEWS#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ 
The new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals, is 
fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has 
some merit. However, he states unequivocally "the scandals in business 
are far less significant than the scandals in labor". I must, 
in fairness, take issue with his premise, primarily because the so-called 
scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals.

The area most prominently commented on during the McClellan 
hearings had to do with "sweetheart contracts". These arrangements 
would have been impossible if the business community was truly 
interested in the welfare of its employes. A sweetheart arrangement 
can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous 
labor leaders demanding tribute. Anyone familiar with the details 
of the McClellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart 
arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented 
the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.   Further, it 
should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress 
to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the 
Landrum-Griffin Act. 

#ESCALATION UNTO DEATH#

The nuclear war is already being fought, 
except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets- not yet. 
It is being fought, moreover, in fairly close correspondence with 
the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories. They predicted
