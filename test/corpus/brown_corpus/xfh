very disappointing. Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas. 
This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of 
the 11-year-old boys in America <cannot chin themselves once>, and 
that English school girls outdo them in almost every test (even dashes 
and endurance). The only area in which American boys hold their own 
is the baseball throw. 

#THE CHINNING BAR#

For arm and shoulder 
strength a chinning bar is recommended. It should be installed over 
a door that is in full view of everyone, and a chair should be placed 
under it, a little to one side. Those children who can chin themselves 
should be told to do <one> chin up each time they pass under it. 
Those who are too weak, should climb on the chair and, starting at the 
top of the chin, let themselves <slowly> down. When they can take 
ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have the strength to 
chin <up>. Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged 
to do the same with the whole family at home. 

#THE HORSE KICK# 

Arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength will be aided with 
the Horse Kick. Start on hands and feet. Keeping the hands in 
the starting position, run in place to a quick rhythm. After this has 
become easy, use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher. 
Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on 
all fours, kicking as high as possible. 

#PUSH-UPS#

Push-ups are 
essential, but few have the strength for them at first. Start on the 
knees in a large circle. Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let 
the body down to rest on the floor. Push back up and repeat. Do this 
exercise six times each class period. As strength improves start in 
a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward. 
Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength 
improves, fall farther and farther out. Try to push back to the stand 
position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes 
from the hands. The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the 
<top> of the push-up with legs spread wide. Let the body down slowly, 
taking at least five seconds for the letting <down>. Five of these 
done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-<up>. 

#HANDSTANDS#

Handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders 
have developed at least a minimum of strength. Of course those 
who have developed more will find them easier. Start with the class 
standing in a circle, with weight on the right foot and the left extended 
a little way into the circle. At first each child should do a kick 
up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work 
alone, and those who need help. Drop both hands to the floor and at the 
same time kick the right foot up in back. The left will follow at 
once. The right will land first, followed by the left. Return to the 
standing position. Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed 
on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot 
is brought as close to the hands as possible. This will prevent flat 
falls and toe injuries. Bare feet are better for such work than any 
form of slipper. Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough 
so that the teacher can catch the leading leg. The child should 
then bring both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten the 
seat muscles. Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the 
hands and that only one foot lands at a time. 

#BACKBENDS#

The backbend 
is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics, and, 
as with all acrobatics, the sooner begun the better the results. Have 
the class lie supine with knees apart and bent. Place flat palms on 
either side of the head a few inches away from the ears, <fingers pointing 
toward the shoulders>. Arch the back upwards to make a bridge. 
Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor 
rather than toward the ceiling. As flexibility improves, the feet will 
move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher. Later this can 
be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover. 

#BACK CIRCLE# 

To further increase back flexibility, work on the back circle. Have 
the class lie prone. Place the hands in front of the chest. Keep 
the legs straight and the toes pointed. Straighten the arms slowly, 
this arches the back. At the peak of the arch, tip the head back and 
bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head. Improvement can be 
measured by the lessening distance between toes and head. 

#SOMERSAULTS# 

The last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the 
somersault, or forward roll. This used to be part of every child's 
bag of tricks, but few children can do it today; some are actually 
incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting 
or standing upright. For most small children, learning a forward 
roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can. After it has 
been seen, have the child start on a mat on hands and knees (a thin, 
inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require 
falling). He places the hands on either side of the head, keeping 
the chin down on the chest. He then pushes his seat into the air and 
the teacher guides it over. One or two practice runs should be sufficient 
for solo. If, however, the child is weak, overweight, or afraid, 
more help will be needed. When the child raises his seat into the air, 
the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis; then no matter 
what happens, the child's performance will be controlled. By lifting 
the seat upwards a little, the weight is taken off the neck and 
the back is kept rounded.   These are beginnings, but correctly 
learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed 
by a strong, flexible body (we are not talking of eccentric extremes). 
Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler 
will be a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being with 
a greater margin of safety in any activity.   It is very important 
for parents to understand that early training is imperative. And dancing 
school, so helpful in artistic and psychological development, also 
contributes to this essential early training- and can contribute 
even more.

EVERY taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual 
defense 
budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion 
of these expenditures go for military electronics. We have noted how 
some electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort, have evenutally 
been used in commerce and industry. The host of novel applications 
of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because 
of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.

When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment, 
the prospect is staggering. The author has recently studied 
the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that, in this 
area alone, the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities. 
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be 
greater by far than any previous medical discovery. We use the term 
"bio-medicine" because of the close interrelation between biology 
and medical research.   Electronics has been applied to medicine 
for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine, 
the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy machine. Recently many 
doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage 
of bruises, 
contusions, and simple bursitis.   Commonly used electronic 
devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit 
~TV and audio systems for internal paging and instruction, 
along with radiation counters, timers, and similar devices.

In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application 
of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this 
is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates. From the wealth 
of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques 
perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which 
appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely 
new tools in medical research. 

#ULTRAVIOLET MICROSCOPY# 

Many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are transparent to visible 
light and must be stained for microscopic investigation. This stain 
often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside. 
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure 
will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light 
with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-~TV 
system to view the results.   Fig& 1 is a simplified block 
diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical 
Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute. By combining the 
talents of a medical man, Dr& Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr& 
Berkely, 
and an electronics expert, Dr& Zworykin, this novel technique 
has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding 
life processes.   Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet 
radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the 
three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources. 
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the 
rotating mirror; the specimen is magnified by the microscope. Instead 
of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the ~TV camera 
does the "looking". The microscope and orthicon are both selected 
to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that all 
lenses must be quartz.   The video signal is amplified and then 
switched, in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which 
are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of 
a second only one wavelength, corresponding to red, green, or blue, is 
seen. (Note: Because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source 
to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated 
by a synchronous motor. This assembly also supplies a 20-~cps 
switching gate for the electronics circuitry.) This is the same system 
as was used in the field-sequential color-~TV system which preceded 
the present simultaneous system. Three separate amplifiers then 
drive a 21-inch tricolor tube. The result is a color picture of the 
specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet 
wavelengths.   Many of the cells and microorganisms which 
are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter 
wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum. Different parts of these cells 
sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often 
possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color. 
Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows 
or nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation 
into a color ~TV picture reveal a wealth of detail.   At the 
present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is 
primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it.
