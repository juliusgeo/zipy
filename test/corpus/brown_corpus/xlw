beebread loaf and the egg compartment is closed. The queen afterward 
keeps incubating and guarding her eggs like a mother hen, taking a sip 
from time to time from the rather liquid honey in her honey pots. When 
the larvae hatch, they feed on the beebread, although they also receive 
extra honey meals from their mother. She continues to add to the 
pollen supply as needed.   The larvae, kept warm by the queen, 
are full grown in about ten days. Each now makes a tough, papery cocoon 
and pupates. After another two weeks, the first young emerge, four 
to eight small daughters that begin to play the role of worker bees, 
collecting pollen and nectar in the field and caring for the new young 
generation while the queen retires to a life of egg laying. The first 
worker bees do not mate or lay eggs; males and mating females do not 
emerge until later in the season. The broods of workers that appear 
later tend to be bigger than the first ones, probably because they are 
better fed. By the middle of the summer, many of the larvae apparently 
receive such a good diet that it is "optimal", and it is then 
that young queens begin to appear. Simultaneously, males or drones are 
produced, mostly from the unfertilized eggs of workers, although a 
few may be produced by the queen. The young queens and drones leave the 
nest and mate, and after a short period of freedom, the fertilized 
young 
queens will begin to dig in for the winter. It is an amazing fact that 
in some species this will happen while the summer is still in full 
swing, for instance, in August. The temperature then is still very 
high. At the old nest, the queen will in the early fall cease to lay 
the fertilized eggs that will produce females. As a result, the proportion 
of males (which leave the nest) increases, and eventually the old 
colony will die out completely. The nest itself, the structure that 
in some cases housed about 2,000 individuals when the season was at its 
peak, is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae of certain 
beetles and moths.   Not always, though, does the development of 
a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just described. 
Some members of the bee family have become idlers, social parasites 
that live at the expense of their hardworking relatives. Bumblebees 
can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts of <Psithyrus>, the 
"cuckoo-bumblebee" as it is called in some European countries. 
Female individuals of <Psithyrus> look deceptively like the workers 
and queens of the bumblebees they victimize. The one sure way to tell 
victim and villain apart is to examine the hind legs which in the 
case of the idler, <Psithyrus>, lack the pollen baskets- naturally! 
The female parasite spends much time in her efforts to find a nest 
of her host. When she succeeds, she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively, 
to deposit an egg on a completed loaf of beebread before the 
bumblebees seal the egg compartment. The hosts never seem to recognize 
that something is amiss, so that the compartment afterward is sealed 
normally. Thus, the larvae of the intruder can develop at the expense 
of the rightful inhabitants and the store of beebread. Later on, they 
and the mother <Psithyrus> are fed by the <Bombus> workers. 
Worse still, in a number of cases it has been claimed that the <Psithyrus> 
female kills off the <Bombus> queen.   But let us return, 
after this gruesome interlude, to our willow catkins in the spring; 
there are other wild bees that command our attention.   It 
is almost certain that some of these, usually a trifle smaller than the 
honeybees, are andrenas or mining bees. There are about 200 different 
kinds of <Andrena> in Europe alone. One of my favorites is <A& 
armata>, a species very common in England, where it is sometimes 
referred to as the lawn bee. The females like to burrow in the short 
turf of well-kept lawns, where their little mounds of earth often appear 
by the hundreds. Almost equal in size to a honeybee. <A& armata> 
is much more beautiful in color, at least in the female of the species: 
a rich, velvety, rusty red. The males are much duller.

After having mated, an <Andrena> female digs a hole straight down 
into the ground, forming a burrow about the size of a lead pencil. 
The bottom part of a burrow has a number of side tunnels or "cells", 
each of which is provided with an egg plus a store of beebread. The 
development of the <Andrena> larvae is very rapid, so that by the 
end of spring they have already pupated and become adults. But they 
are still enclosed in their larval cells and remain there throughout 
the summer, fall, and winter. Their appearance, next spring, coincides 
in an almost uncanny way with the flowering of their host plants. 
In the Sacramento valley in California, for instance, it has been observed 
that there was not one day's difference between the emergence 
of the andrenas and the opening of the willow catkins. This must be 
due to a completely identical response to the weather, in the plant and 
the animal.   After the male and female andrenas have mated, 
the cycle is repeated. Although <Andrena> is gregarious, so that we 
may find hundreds and hundreds of burrows together, we must still call 
it a solitary bee. Its life history is much simpler than that of the 
truly colonial bumblebees and can serve as an example of the life 
cycle of many other species. After all, social life in the group of 
the bees is by no means general, although it certainly is a striking 
feature. On the basis of its life history, we like to think that <Andrena> 
is more primitive than the bumblebees. The way in which it transports 
its pollen is not so perfect, either. It lacks pollen baskets 
and possesses only a large number of long, branched hairs on its legs, 
on which the pollen grains will collect. Still <Andrena> will 
do a reasonably good job, so that an animal with a full pollen load looks 
like a gay little piece of yellow down floating in the wind.

Closely related to the andrenas are the nomias or alkali bees. <Nomia 
melanderi> can be found in tremendous numbers in certain parts of 
the United States west of the Great Plains, for example, in Utah 
and central Washington. In the United States Department of Agriculture's 
<Yearbook of Agriculture, 1952>, which is devoted entirely 
to insects, George E& Bohart mentions a site in Utah which 
was estimated to contain 200,000 nesting females. Often the burrows 
are only an inch or two apart, and the bee cities cover several acres. 
The life history of the alkali bee is similar to that of <Andrena>, 
but the first activity of the adults does not take place until summer, 
and the individuals hibernate in the prepupal stage. In most places, 
there are two generations a year, a second brood of adults appearing 
late in the summer.   I must plead guilty to a special sympathy 
for nomias. This may just be pride in my adopted State of Washington, 
but certainly I love to visit their mound cities near Yakima and 
Prosser in July or August, when the bees are in their most active 
period. The name "alkali bee" indicates that one has to look for 
them in rather inhospitable places. Sometimes, although by no means 
always, these are indeed alkaline. The thing is that these bees love 
a fine-grained soil that is moist; yet the water in the ground should 
not be stagnant either. They dislike dense vegetation. Where does 
one find such conditions? The best chance, of course, is offered by 
gently sloping terrain where the water remains close to the surface and 
where the air is dry, so that a high evaporation leaves salty deposits 
which permit only sparse plant growth. 
Many other (probably nearly all) snakes at maturity are already more 
than half their final length. Laurence M& Klauber put length at maturity 
at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnakes, and Charles 
C& Carpenter's data on Michigan garter and ribbon snakes 
(<Thamnophis>) show that the smallest gravid females are more than 
half as long as the biggest adults. Felix Kopstein states that "when 
the snake reaches its maturity it has already reached about its maximal 
length", but goes on to cite the reticulate python as an exception, 
with maximum length approximately three times that at maturity. 
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes do not grow 
appreciably after attaining maturity; he was working with species 
of Java, so perhaps some tropical snakes are unusual in this respect. 
Certain individual giants recorded later did fail to show a reasonable 
difference after maturity, but it is impossible to know whether this 
is due to captive conditions. Additional records of slow growth have 
been omitted.   It is possible to make a few generalizations about 
the six giants themselves. There seems to be a rough correlation 
between the initial and ultimate lengths, starting with the smallest 
(boa constrictor) and ending with the largest (anaconda). Data on the 
former are scanty, but there can be little doubt that the latter is sometimes 
born at a length greater than that of any of the others, thereby 
lending support to the belief that the anaconda does, indeed, attain 
the greatest length. For four of the six (the anaconda and the amethystine 
python cannot be included for lack of data) there is also a correlation 
between size at maturity and maximum length, the boa constrictor 
being the smallest and the Indian python the next in size at the 
former stage.   Let us speculate a little on the maximum size 
of the anaconda. If, in a certain part of the range, it starts life 1 
foot longer than do any of the other (relatively large) giants, and reaches 
maturity at, let us guess, 18 inches longer than the others, a 
quadrupling of the maturity length would result in a maximum of (nearly) 
40 feet.   When it comes to rate of early growth, the Indian 
python leads with a figure of about 3 feet 6 inches per year for the 
first two years, more or less. The African rock python, a close second, 
is followed in turn by the reticulate python. There are few data 
on the boa constrictor, those for the anaconda are unconvincing, and 
there is nothing at all on the amethystine python. It seems likely that 
the Indian python comes out ahead because records of its growth have 
been made more carefully and frequently; it responds exceptionally 
well to captivity and does not reach proportions that make it hard to 
keep.   I cannot make sense out of the figures for post maturity 
growth; at best the annual increase appears to be a matter of inches 
rather than feet. Until better records have been kept over longer 
periods of time and much more is known about the maximum dimensions, 
it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions.   It is often 
stated 
that the largest snakes require five years to attain maturity, but 
this apparently is an overestimation. The best way to determine the 
correct figure (in captives) is by direct observation of pairs isolated 
from birth, a method that produced surprising results: maturing of 
a male Indian python in less than two years, his mate in less than three; 
data on the boa constrictor about match this.   Another approach 
is to estimate from the rate of growth and the smallest size at 
maturity. Results from this approach amply confirm the direct observations: 
about three years are required, there being a possible slight 
difference between males and females in the time required. Only the 
amethystine python and the anaconda must be excluded for lack or paucity 
of data.   The following information on snakes varying greatly 
in size (but all with less than a 10-foot maximum) shows, when considered 
with the foregoing, that there is probably no correlation between 
the length of a snake and the time required for it to mature. Oliver, 
in his summary of the habits of the snakes of the United States, 
could supply data on the maturing period for only three species in addition 
to the rattlers, which I shall consider separately. These three 
were much alike: lined snake (<Tropidoclonion>), one year and 
nine months; red-bellied snake (<Storeria>), two years; cottonmouth 
(<Ancistrodon>), two years. Klauber investigated the rattlesnakes 
carefully himself and also summarized what others have found. He 
concluded that in the southern species, which are rapidly growing types, 
females mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young 
when they are three. Other herpetologists have ascertained that in 
the northern United States the prairie rattlesnake may not give first 
birth until it is four or even five years old, and that the young may 
be born every other year, rather than annually. Carpenter's study 
showed that female common garter and ribbon snakes of Michigan mature 
at about the age of two.

Oversized monsters are 
never brought home either alive or preserved, and field measurements 
are obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate 
dimensions. Measurements of skins are of little value; every 
snake hide is noticeably longer than its carcass and intentional stretching 
presents no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer.   In
