
In his letter mentioning Shakespeare on January 24, 1597/8, Sturley 
asked Quiney especially that "theare might [be] bi Sir Ed& 
Grev& some meanes made to the Knightes of the Parliament for 
an ease and discharge of such taxes and subsedies wherewith our towne 
is like to be charged, and I assure u I am in great feare and doubte 
bi no meanes hable to paie. Sir Ed& Gre& is gonne to Brestowe 
and from thence to Lond& as I heare, who verie well knoweth our estates 
and wil be willinge to do us ani good". The knights for Warwickshire 
in this parliament, which ended its session on February 9, 
were Fulke Greville (the poet) and William Combe of Warwick, as Fulke 
Greville and Edward Greville had been in 1593. The corporation 
voted on September 27, 1598, that Quiney should ride to London about 
the suit to Sir John Fortescue, chancellor of the Exchequer, 
for discharging of the tax and subsidy. He had been in London for several 
weeks when he wrote to Shakespeare on October 25. Sturley on 
November 4 answered a letter from Quiney written on October 25 which 
imported, wrote Sturley, "that our countriman **f **f Shak& would 
procure us monei: which I will like of as I shall heare when wheare 
+ howe: and I prai let not go that occasion if it mai sort to 
ani indifferent condicions. Allso that if monei might be had for 30 
or **f a lease +c& might be procured". Sturley quoted Quiney as 
having written on November 1 that if he had "more monei presente much 
might be done to obtaine our Charter enlargd, ij& faires more, with 
tole of corne, bestes, and sheepe, and a matter of more valewe then 
all that". Sturley thought that this matter might be "the rest 
of the tithes and the College houses and landes in our towne". He 
suggested offering half to Sir Edward, fearing lest "he shall thinke 
it to good for us and procure it for himselfe, as he served us the 
last time". This refers to what had happened after the Earl of Warwick 
died in 1590, when the town petitioned Burghley for the right to 
name the vicar and schoolmaster and other privileges but Greville bought 
the lordship for himself. Sturley's allusion probably explains 
why Greville took out the patent in the names of Best and Wells, 
for Sir Anthony Ashley described Best as "a scrivener within Temple 
Bar, that deals in many matters for my L& Essex" through Sir 
Gelly Merrick, especially in "causes that he would not be known 
of".   Adrian Quiney wrote to his son Richard on October 
29 and again perhaps the next day, since the bearer of the letter, the 
bailiff, was expected to reach London on November 1. In his second 
letter the old mercer advised his son "to bye some such warys as yow 
may selle presentlye with profet. yff yow bargen with **f sha **h 
[so in the ~MS] or Receave money ther or brynge your money home 
yow maye see howe knite stockynges be sold ther ys gret byinge of them 
at Aysshom **h. wherefore I thynke yow maye doo good yff yow can have 
money". This seems to refer, not to the loan Richard had asked 
for, but to a proposed bargain with Shakespeare.   Richard Quiney 
the younger, a schoolboy of eleven, wrote a letter in Latin asking 
his father to buy copybooks ("<chartaceos libellos>") for him 
and his brother. His mother Bess, who could not write herself, reminded 
her husband through Sturley to buy the apron he had promised her 
and "a suite of hattes for 5 boies the yongst lined + trimmed with silke" 
(for John, only a year old). A letter signed "Isabell Bardall" 
entreated "Good Cozen" Quiney to find her stepson Adrian, 
son of George Bardell, a place in London with some handicraftsman. 
William Parsons and William Walford, drapers, asked Quiney to 
see to business matters in London. Daniel Baker deluged his "Unckle 
Quyne" with requests to pay money for him to drapers in Watling 
Street and at the Two Cats in Canning Street. His letter of 
October 26 named two of the men about whom Quiney had written to Shakespeare 
the day before. Baker wrote: "I tooke order with **f E& 
Grevile for the payment of Ceartaine monei beefore his going towardes 
London. + synce I did write unto him to dessier him to paie **f 
for mee which standeth mee greatly uppon to have paide. + **f more 
**f peeter Rowswell 
tooke order with his master to paie for mee". He 
asked Quiney to find out whether the money had been paid and, if not, 
to send to the lodging of Sir Edward and entreat him to pay what 
he owed. Baker added: "I pray you delivre these inclosed Letters 
And Comend mee to **f Rychard mytton whoe I know will ffreind 
mee for the payment of this monei". Further letters in November mention 
that Sir Edward paid forty pounds.   Stratford's petition 
to the queen declared that two great fires had burnt two hundred 
houses in the town, with household goods, to the value of twelve thousand 
pounds. The chancellor of the Exchequer wrote on the petition: 
"in myn opinion it is very resonable and conscionable for hir ma<ies>tie 
to graunt in relief of this towne twise afflicted and almost wasted 
by fire". The queen agreed on December 17, a warrant was signed 
on January 27, and the Exchequer paid Quiney his expenses on February 
27, 1598/9. He listed what he had spent for "My own diet in 
London eighteen weeks, in which I was sick a month; my mare at coming 
up 14 days; another I bought there to bring me home 7 weeks; 
and I was six days going thither and coming homewards; all which 
cost me at the least @20". He was allowed forty-four pounds in all, 
including fees to the masters of requests, Mr& Fanshawe of the 
Exchequer, the solicitor general, and other officials and their clerks. 
If he borrowed money from Shakespeare or with his help, he would 
now have been able to repay the loan.   Since more is known about 
Quiney than about any other acquaintance of Shakespeare in Stratford, 
his career may be followed to its sudden end in 1602. During 1598 
and 1599 he made "manye Guiftes of myne owne provision bestowed uppon 
Cowrtiers + others for the better effectinge of our suites in hande". 
He was in London "searching records for our town's causes" 
in 1600 with young Henry Sturley, the assistant schoolmaster. When 
Sir Edward Greville enclosed the town commons on the Bancroft, 
Quiney and others leveled his hedges on January 21, 1600/1, and were 
charged with riot by Sir Edward. He also sued them for taking toll 
of grain at their market. Accompanied by "Master Greene our solicitor" 
(Thomas Greene of the Middle Temple, Shakespeare's "cousin"), 
Quiney tried to consult Sir Edward Coke, attorney general, 
and gave money to a clerk and a doorkeeper "that we might have 
access to their master for his counsel **h butt colde nott have him 
att Leasure by the reason of thees trobles" (the Essex rising on February 
8). He set down that "I gave **f Greene a pynte of muskadell 
and a roll of bread that last morning I went to have his company 
to Master Attorney". After returning to Stratford he drew up a 
defense 
of the town's right to toll corn and the office of collecting it, 
and his list of suggested witnesses included his father and Shakespeare's 
father. No one, he wrote, took any corn of Greville's, for 
his bailiff of husbandry "swore a greate oathe thatt who soe came 
to put hys hande into hys sackes for anye corne shuld leave hys hande 
be hynde hym". Quiney was in London again in June, 1601, and in 
November, when he rode up, as Shakespeare must often have done, by way 
of Oxford, High Wycombe, and Uxbridge, and home through Aylesbury 
and Banbury.   After Quiney was elected bailiff in September, 
1601, without Greville's approval, Greene wrote him that Coke 
had promised to be of counsel for Stratford and had advised "that 
the office of bayly may be exercised as it is taken upon you, (**f Edwardes 
his consent not beinge hadd to the swearinge of you)". Asked 
by 
the townsmen to cease his suit, Greville had answered that "hytt 
shulde coste hym **f first + sayed it must be tried ether before my Lorde 
Anderson in the countrey or his uncle ffortescue in the exchequer 
with whom he colde more prevaile then we". The corporation proposed 
Chief Justice Anderson for an arbiter, sending him a gift of sack 
and claret. Lady Greville, daughter of the late Lord Chancellor 
Bromley and niece of Sir John Fortescue, was offered twenty pounds 
by the townsmen to make peace; she "labored + thought she shuld 
effecte" it but her husband said that "we shuld wynne it by the sworde". 
His servant Robin Whitney threatened Quiney, who had Whitney 
bound to "the good abaringe" to keep the peace. A report of 
**f Edw: Grevyles minaces to the Baileefe Aldermen + Burgesses 
of Stratforde" tells how Quiney was injured by Greville's men: 
"in the tyme **f Ryc' Quyney was bayleefe ther came some of 
them whoe beinge druncke fell to braweling in ther hosts howse wher 
thei druncke + drewe ther dagers uppon the hoste: att a faier tyme the 
Baileefe being late abroade to see the towne in order + comminge by 
in 
**f hurley Burley. came into the howse + commawnded the peace to be 
kept butt colde nott prevayle + in hys endevor to sticle the brawle had 
his heade grevouselye brooken by one of hys [Greville's] men whom 
nether hym selfe [Greville] punnished nor wolde suffer to be punnished 
but with a shewe to turne them awaye + enterteyned agayne". 
The fall of Rome, the discovery of precious metals, and the Protestant 
Reformation were all links and could only be explained and understood 
by comprehending the links that preceded and those that followed.

Often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct 
by those individuals or nations which he is studying. Unconsciously, 
governments or races or institutions may enter into some undertaking 
without fully realizing why they are doing so. They react in obedience 
to an instinct or urge which has itself been impelled by natural 
law. A court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feeling 
that the law is inimical to the numerical majority. A nation may 
go to war on some trifling pretext, when in reality it may have been 
guided by an unconscious instinct that its very life was at stake. When 
the historian encounters a situation in which he can perceive no visible 
cause and effect sequence, he should be alert to intuition and unconscious 
instinct as possible guides.   Adams firmly contended 
that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical 
environment on history. Here was another indispensable tool. Indeed, 
he concluded that "geographical conditions have exercised a great, 
possibly a preponderating, influence over man's destiny". The failure 
of Greece to reach the imperial destiny that Periclean Athens 
had seemed to promise was almost directly attributable to her physical 
conformation. All areas of history were either favorably or adversely 
affected by the geographical environment, and no respectable historian 
could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of 
geography.   Brooks Adams was consistent in his admonishments 
to historians about the necessary tools or insights they needed to possess. 
However, as a practicing historian, he, himself, has left few clues 
to the amount of professional scholarship that he used when writing 
history. In fact, if judgments are to be rendered upon the soundness 
of his historicism, they must be based on scanty evidence. What evidence 
is available would seem to indicate that Brooks, unlike his older 
brother Henry, had most of the methodological vices usually found 
in the amateur. A credulousness, a distaste for documentation, an uncritical 
reliance on contemporary accounts, and a proneness to assume 
a theory as true before adequate proof was provided were all evidences 
of his failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate 
the responsibilities of the historian to his reading public. This 
is not to assume that his work was without merit, but the validity 
of his assumptions concerning the meaning of history must always be 
considered against this background of an unprofessional approach.

His credulity is perhaps best illustrated in his introduction to <The 
Emancipation of Massachusetts>, which purports to examine the 
trials of Moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the Israelite 
exodus from Egypt and the leadership of the Puritan clergy in 
colonial New England. Much criticism has been leveled at this rather 
forced analogy, but what is equally significant is Adams' complete 
acceptance of the Biblical record as "good and trustworthy history". 
In light of the scholarly reappraisals engendered by the higher 
criticism this is a most remarkable statement, particularly coming 
from one who was well known for his antifundamentalist views. The desire 
to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique 
smacks more of 
the propagandist than the historian.   A similar amateurish 
characteristic is revealed in Adams' failure to check the
