vapor-pressure measurements (see p& 144). _ACOUSTICAL INTERFEROMETER._ 
An acoustical interferometer has been constructed and 
used, with helium gas as the thermometric fluid, to measure temperatures 
near 4.2 and 2.1 **f. Such an interferometer provides a means of absolute 
temperature measurement, and may be used as an alternative to 
the gas thermometer. When values of temperature derived with this instrument 
were compared with the accepted values associated with liquid 
helium-4 vapor pressures, differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively 
were found. This result is preliminary, and work is continuing. 
_RESISTANCE THERMOMETERS._ Carbon resistors and impurity-doped 
germanium resistors have been investigated for use as precision secondary 
thermometers in the liquid helium temperature region. Several 
germanium resistors have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 **f and 
their resistances have been found to be reproducible within 1/3 millidegree 
when temperatures were derived from a vapor pressure thermometer 
whose tubing is jacketed through most of the liquid helium. Preliminary 
calibrations of the resistors have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 
**f at every 0.1 **f. The estimated standard deviations of the data for 
two of the resistors were @ 1 millidegree; and for the third resistor, 
@ 3.3 millidegrees. _VAPOR PRESSURE METHOD._ The reproducibilities 
of helium vapor-pressure thermometers have been investigated 
in conjunction with a "constant temperature" liquid helium bath 
from 4.2 to 1.8 **f. Surface temperature gradients have been found to 
exist in liquid helium baths contained in 15-and 25-liter metallic storage 
dewars. The gradient was about one half of a millidegree at 4.2 
**f but increased to several millidegrees for bath temperatures slightly 
greater than the ~|l point. A hydrostatic head correction has 
been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressures 
or temperatures for the bulk liquid helium. However, the surface 
temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurements 
for the bulk liquid helium unless precautions are taken to isolate 
the tube (which passes through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb) 
from the liquid helium surface. It has also been observed, in helium 
/2,, that large discrepancies can exist between surface vapor pressures 
and those pressures measured by a vapor pressure thermometer. This 
has been attributed to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer. 
In this case also the design of the thermometer can be modified 
to reduce the helium film flow. _PRESSURE TRANSDUCER FOR ~PVT 
MEASUREMENTS._ Precise pressure-volume-temperature measurements on 
corrosive gases are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer. 
A prototype which fulfills the requirements was developed and 
thoroughly tested. The transducer is a null-type instrument and employs 
a stretched diaphragm, 0.001 in& thick and 1 in& in diameter. 
A small pressure unbalance displaces the diaphragm and changes the capacitance 
between the diaphragm and an electrically insulated plate spaced 
0.001 in& apart (for **f). Spherical concave backing surfaces 
support the diaphragm when excessive pressures are applied and prevent 
the stresses within the diaphragm from exceeding the elastic limit. 
Over a temperature range from 25 to 200 **f and at pressures up to 
250 ~atm, an overload of 300 ~psi, applied for a period of one day, 
results in an uncertainty in the pressure of, at most, one millimeter 
of mercury. _TRANSPORT PROPERTIES OF AIR._ A 6-year study of the 
transport properties of air at elevated temperatures has been completed. 
This project was carried out under sponsorship of the Ballistic 
Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command, U&S& 
Air Force, and had as its goal the investigation of the transport 
by diffusion of the heat energy of chemical binding. A significant 
effect discovered during the study is the existence of Prandtl 
numbers reaching values of more than unity in the nitrogen dissociation 
region. Another effect discovered is the large coefficient of thermal 
diffusion tending to separate nitrogen from the oxygen when temperature 
differences straddling the nitrogen dissociation region are present. 
The results of the study, based on collision integrals computed from 
the latest critically evaluated data on intermolecular forces in air, 
will be reported in the form of a table of viscosity, thermal conductivity, 
thermal diffusion, and diffusion coefficients at temperatures 
of 1,000 to 10,000 **f and of logarithm of pressure in atmospheres from 
**f to **f times normal density. _INTERNATIONAL COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES._ 
In March, 1961, representatives of the national laboratories 
of Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, U&S&S&R&, 
United States, and West Germany, met at the ~NBS 
to devise means for reaching international agreement on a temperature 
scale between 10 and 90 **f. As a first step toward this goal, 
arrangements were worked out for comparing the scales now in use through 
circulation of a group of standard platinum resistance thermometers 
for calibration by each national laboratory. Such a group of thermometers 
was obtained and calibrated at the ~NBS. These thermometers 
have now been sent to the United Kingdom for calibration at the National 
Physical Laboratory. _TEMPERATURE SYMPOSIUM._ During the 
last week of march 1961, Columbus, Ohio was the site of the Fourth 
Symposium on Temperature, Its Measurement and Control in Science 
and Industry. The Symposium, which was jointly sponsored by the 
American Institute of Physics, the Instrument Society of America, 
and the National Bureau of Standards, attracted nearly one thousand 
registrants, including many from abroad. The Bureau contributed 
to the planning and success of the Symposium through the efforts of Mr& 
W& A& Wildhack, General Chairman, and Dr& C& M& 
Herzfeld, Program Chairman. Dr& A& V& Astin, ~NBS 
Director, opened the 5-day session with introductory remarks, following 
which a total of twenty-six papers were given throughout the week 
by ~NBS scientists, from both the Washington and Boulder Laboratories. 

#2.1.6. ATOMIC PHYSICS#

In addition to the basic programs 
in wavelength standards, spectroscopy, solid state physics, interactions 
of the free electron and atomic constants which are necessary to 
provide the foundation for technological progress, the Bureau has strengthened 
its activities in laboratory astrophysics. The programs in 
infrared spectroscopy are undergoing reorientation toward wavelength standards 
in the far infrared, the application of infrared techniques to 
solid state studies, and increased emphasis on high resolution instrumentation. 
Two data centers have been established for the collection, 
indexing, critical evaluation, and dissemination of bibliographies and 
critical values in the fields of transition probabilities and collision 
cross sections. _LABORATORY ASTROPHYSICS._ _TRANSITION PROBABILITIES._ 
Under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research 
and the Advanced Research Projects Agency, a data center was established 
to gather and index all published information on atomic transition 
probabilities. An exhaustive survey was made of the literature, 
and a primary reference file of approximately 600 references was catalogued. 
Selected bibliographies and tables of available data are now 
in preparation.   A wall-stabilized high-current arc source was 
constructed and used to study transition probabilities of atomic hydrogen 
and oxygen. This apparatus will also be used to measure transition 
probabilities of a large number of other elements. A study of the hydrogen 
line profiles indicates that a measurement of these profiles can 
be used to calculate a temperature for the arc plasma that is reliable 
to about **f percent.   A set of tables containing spectral intensities 
for 39,000 lines of 70 elements, as observed in a copper matrix 
in a ~d-c arc, was completed and published. Studies of the intensity 
data indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition 
probabilities. These data are not of the precision obtainable by 
the methods previously mentioned, but the vast number of approximate values 
available will be useful in many areas. _ATOMIC ENERGY LEVELS._ 
Research continues on the very complex spectra of the rare earth 
elements. New computer and automation techniques were applied to these 
spectra with considerable success.
