always strongly resented the charge of being "un-English". I 
have not seen this charge made during my stay here, but apparently it 
is still in the air. For example, a writer in a recent number of <The 
Queen> hyperbolically states that "of the myriad imprecations the 
only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion 
that they are 'un-English'". In this connection, it has been 
observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics, priests and 
laity, in England, while certainly seen as good for Catholicism, 
is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic 
English Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to remind 
their Christian brethren of this good. ##

ONE OF THE 
more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century 
is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities. 
At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics, 
partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854. Moreover, 
for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the 
city to care for their religious needs. Now, not only are there considerably 
more laity as students and professors at Oxford, but there 
are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable 
and friendly relations with the non-Catholic members of the University. 
Some Catholic priests lecture there; Catholic seminarians attend 
tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-Catholic students.

Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable 
position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it 
in the mass media of England. The general tone of articles appearing 
in such important newspapers as the Manchester <Guardian> and the 
Sunday <Observer> implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic 
Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant 
churches. On successive Sundays during October, 1960, Paul Ferris 
(a non-Catholic) wrote articles in the <Observer> depicting 
clergymen of the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist 
Church. The Catholic priest, though somewhat superficially 
drawn, easily came out the best. There were many letters of strong 
protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman, who was indeed 
portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters 
and without really very much to do as clergyman. Such a series of 
articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-Victorian 
England. There was so much interest shown in this present-day 
venture that it was continued on B&B&C&, where comments were 
equally made by an Anglican parson, a Free Church minister and a Catholic 
priest.   Catholic priests have frequently appeared on 
television programs, sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal 
footing with Protestant clergymen. A notable example of this was 
the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, 
Dr& Heenan, and the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr& 
Ramsey, recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. The good 
feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now 
well known in England. The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary 
has been televised several times in recent months. And it was 
interesting to observe that B&B&C&'s television film on Christmas 
Eve was <The Bells of St& Mary's>.   Of course, 
the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern 
of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr& 
Fisher, then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Vatican 
last December. It was the first time an English Primate has done 
this since the 14th century. English Catholics reacted to this event 
with moderate but real hope.   Almost daily something is reported 
which feeds this Catholic hope in England: statistics of the increasing 
numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants; news of 
a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic 
priest to preach from his pulpit; a report that a Catholic nun 
had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic secondary school during 
the sickness of one of its masters; the startling statement in a 
respectable periodical that "Catholics, if the present system is still 
in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords 
in the next generation"; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen 
and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at 
a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave. 
The death of a man is unique, and yet it is universal. The straight 
line would symbolize its uniqueness, the circle its universality. But 
how can one figure symbolize both?   Christianity declares that 
in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal 
concur. Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique 
and the universal as clearly, or formulated it as precisely, as Irenaeus. 
To be the Savior and the Lord, Jesus Christ has to be a historical 
individual with a biography all his own; he dare not be a cosmic 
aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself 
with man's history. Yet this utterly individual historical person 
must also contain within himself the common history of mankind. His 
history is his alone, yet each man must recognize his own history in 
it. His death is his alone, yet each man can see his own death in the 
crucifixion of Jesus. Each man can identify himself with the history 
and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified 
himself with human history and human death, coming as the head of a 
new humanity. Not a circle, then, nor a straight line, but a spiral 
represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it; for a spiral has 
motion as well as recurrence. As represented by a spiral, history may, 
in some sense, be said to repeat itself; yet each historical event 
remains unique. Christ is both unique and universal.   The first 
turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam. As 
Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning, 
so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of 
Christ. "Whence, then, comes the substance of the first man? From 
God's Will and Wisdom, and from virgin earth. For 'God had 
not rained', says the Scripture, before man was made, 'and there 
was no man to till the earth'. From this earth, then, while it was 
still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man, the beginning of humanity". 
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private 
individuals, but as universal human beings, who were and are all of humanity. 
Adam and Eve were perfect, not in the sense that they possessed 
perfection, but in the sense that they were capable of development 
toward perfection. They were, in fact, children. Irenaeus does not 
claim pre-existence for the human soul; therefore there is no need for 
him, as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself with the 
fall. Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence 
of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity 
into history. Historical existence is a created good.   The biblical 
symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words: "So 
God created man in his own image; in the similitude of God he created 
him". There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where 
the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished, so 
most notably in the statement: "If the [Holy] Spirit is absent 
from the soul, such a man is indeed of an animal nature; and, being 
left carnal, he will be an imperfect being, possessing the image 
[of 
God] in his formation, but not receiving the similitude [of God] 
through the Spirit". Thus the image of God is that which makes 
a man a man and not an oyster; the similitude of God, by contrast, 
is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature. 
Recent research on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that 
he does not consistently maintain this distinction. He does not mean 
to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through 
the fall; for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly 
mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality. 
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows: 
"So that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur, and become lifted 
up, as if he had no lord, because of the dominion that had been 
given to him, and the freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator, 
overstepping his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance 
towards God, a law was given him by God, that he might know 
that he had for lord the lord of all. And He laid down for him certain 
conditions: so that, if he kept the command of God, then he would 
always remain as he was, that is, immortal; but if he did not, he 
would become mortal, melting into earth, whence his frame had been taken". 
These conditions man did not keep, and thus he became mortal; 
yet he did not stop being human as a result. There is no justification 
for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image 
of God beyond this, nor for reading into his imprecise usage the 
later theological distinction between the image of God (humanity) and 
the similitude of God (immortality).   Man was created with the 
capacity for immortality, but the devil's promise of immortality 
in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality. He was, in the 
words of Irenaeus, "beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality". 
The true way to immortality lay through obedience, but man 
did not believe this.   "Eve was disobedient; for she did 
not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed 
a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin **h, having 
become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and 
to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed 
[to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become 
the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race". 
Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere 
potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created 
as children, Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience 
as being "due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still wicked". 
His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts 
him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin 
Mary. That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too; 
for as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue man, 
so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought 
death into the world, and all our woe.   With this act of disobedience, 
and not with the inception of his individual existence, man 
began the downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending from 
the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality. At 
the nadir of that circuit is death. "Along with the fruit they did 
also fall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience; 
and disobedience to God entails death. Wherefore, as they became 
forfeit to death, from that [moment] they were handed over to it". 
This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam 
and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, 
as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday; he sees 
a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath. In 
any case, though they had been promised immortality if they ate of 
the tree, they obtained mortality instead. The wages of sin is death. 
Man's life, originally shaped for immortality and for communion with 
God, must now be conformed to the shape of death.   Nevertheless, 
even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs 
to God, and he still rules. Even death, therefore, has a providential 
as well as a punitive function.   "Wherefore also He [God] 
drove him [man] out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree 
of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture 
to assert, but because He pitied him, [and did not desire] that 
he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin which surrounded 
him should be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable. But 
He set a bound to his [state of] sin, by interposing death, and thus 
causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the dissolution of the 
flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at 
length to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God". This 
idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well 
into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology; for it prepares the way for 
the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ. 
As man can live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that 
Christ could bring many to life.   It is probably fair to say 
that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of 
sin is. This applies to his picture of Adam. It is borne out also 
by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation 
to the next. It becomes most evident in his description of
