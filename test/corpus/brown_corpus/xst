he had entertained aspirations toward Viola's favors- or, even 
more serious perhaps, that he had attained a share of them and had 
then been superseded by some luckier chap. I did not rest until I had 
tracked the mystery down. Well, here it is.   One day over a 
year before, there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown 
hotel. Viola had been urged to attend, by telephone, and not knowing 
the host or the character of the party, she had gone. She arrived 
late and as she entered the party, noted that gentlemen seemed to be 
in the majority; the air was thick with smoke, empty bottles were 
in evidence, and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor.

Naturally, Viola had no wish to remain, but she felt she 
couldn't leave so soon after her arrival, in all politeness to her 
host. And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken 
refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds; 
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which, 
as Fate would have it, belonged to District Attorney Welch.

As Viola sat there, a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes 
and socks from the unidentified feet and, as a prank, insert rosebuds 
between the toes.   A little later the district attorney woke 
up, emerged from under the couch, looked at his watch, and realized 
he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture 
Forum on "The Civic Spirit of the Southland", in the Byzantine 
room of the hotel where his wife, as president of the forum, was 
to preside. He made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully 
brushed himself off, neatly arranged his hair, and painstakingly selected 
his hat from the many on the bed. Then, noting neither the absence 
of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds, he made his way 
to the Byzantine room and, with his usual dignity, mounted the rostrum. 
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined.

The incident, aside from reflecting on Welch's political 
career, had all but wrecked his home life. He never rested until 
he discovered who the culprit was, and when he did, he vowed vengeance 
on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way. <And here it was!> 
By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in 
motion.   During these first days of the trial I didn't have 
as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked. In the 
first place, it was difficult for us to meet. We couldn't be seen 
together, for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names, 
and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association 
of a man with a girl, no matter how innocent. I couldn't invite 
Viola to our house, for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her.

Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values, 
but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it, which had 
opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her. There, Mother 
was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated 
by the Budweisers (of beer derivation), the Chalmers (of underwear 
origin), and the Heinzes (whose forbears founded a nationally famous 
trade in pickles). I hated being dragged into the salons of these 
aristocrats. But Mother insisted, for it is seldom indeed that anyone 
remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive 
midsts. In fact, it was not until the King of Spain had visited 
at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred 
barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the <hoi-polloi>.

Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial 
opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad, and 
with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was 
a girl who had been to high school. But at long last came a time when 
I broke away from Mother and her society "chi-chi" in order 
to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home.

However, such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial, that 
every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered 
to the world, Society, and even, alas, to my own mother. 
When I arrived at Viola's 
I was shown, to my surprise, into the <kitchen>. 
Viola greeted me, in checked apron, ladle in hand, and explained 
it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing 
dinner.   I sat and watched proceedings. There was to be roast 
chicken with dressing, giblet gravy, asparagus, new peas with a sprig 
of mint, creamed onions, and mashed potatoes- all chosen, prepared, 
and cooked by Viola herself. 
I realized that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem, 
but his agony could have been no greater. The most that was accomplished 
was adding Mrs& Beige's tray to the dish pile, and by means 
of repeated threats, on an ascending scale, seeing that the girls dressed 
themselves, after a fashion.   I was saved from making the 
decision as the phone rang, and the girls were upon me instantly. Here's 
a household hint: if you can't find your children, and get tired 
of calling them, pick up the phone. No matter if your children are 
at the movies, in school, visiting their grandmother, or on a field 
trip in some distant city, they will be upon you magically within seconds 
after you pick up the phone.   Jennie and Miranda twined themselves 
around me, murmuring endearments. Louise climbed onto a stool 
and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone, claiming 
my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency. Somehow 
managing to get out a cool, poised, "Won't you hold on a second, 
please", I covered up the mouthpiece, and with more warmth and less 
poise, gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment, mostly the latter, 
including Devil's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia. 
I promised to illustrate the lecture, if they so much as <breathed> 
till after the call was completed.   Speaking into the phone 
again and recognizing the caller, I resumed my everyday voice. Soon 
we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little 
things like Jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black 
out, Miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table, 
and various screeches, thuds, and giggles. Under the circumstances, 
I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone, but when 
I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to 
remind me of our town meeting the next evening, and how important it 
was that Hank and I be there.   I discovered that the girls had 
shrewdly vacated the kitchen, and were playing quietly in the living 
room. It seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace 
and quiet, instead of carrying out my threats.   Resolving to get 
something done, I started in on the dishes. No. I'm not saying 
it right. What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the 
dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink. They looked 
so formidable, however, so <demanding>, that I found myself staring 
at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again, this time about 
Francesca and her husband. How about them, I thought.   Francesca 
and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia. 
We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved- at that 
time, they had called on us, after I met Fran at a ~PTA meeting, 
and had taken us in hand socially. They had been kind to us and 
we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners, and for information 
as to where to shop, which dentist, doctor, plumber, and sitter 
to call (not that there was much of a choice, since Catatonia was 
just a village; the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly 
thin).   They were "personalities". Herb, an expert on narrow 
ties, thin lapels, and swatches, was men's fashion editor of <Parvenu>, 
the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation. Fran 
and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from 
Nebraska, or was it Wyoming? She was the daughter and sole heiress 
of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and, having arrived 
in New York with a big bank roll, became a dabbler in various fields. 
She patronized Greenwich Village artists for awhile, then put some 
money into a Broadway show which was successful (terrible, but successful). 
It was during her "writing" period that she and Herb 
met and decided that they were in love. They were married at a lavish 
ceremony which was duly recorded in <Parvenu> and all other magazines 
and newspapers, and then they honeymooned in Bermuda. No, not Bermuda. 
Bermuda was not in style that year. They had honeymooned in 
Rome; everyone was very high on Rome that year.   They had bought 
their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of 
suburbia surrounding New York; they had chosen Catatonia because 
of its reputation for excellent schools, beaches, and abundance of names.

"You are bound to get involved with people when you have 
children", Fran had told me at our first meeting, "so it is good 
to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little 
housewives and dull husbands, but People Who Do Things".

I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape 
an uneasiness at their way of <always> doing the <right> things. 
Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored 
(guided by an eminent architect) and updated, and added on to. It had 
a gourmet's corner (instead of a kitchen), a breakfast room, a luncheon 
room, a dining room, a sitting room, a room for standing up, a 
party room, dressing rooms for everybody, even a room for mud. It was 
all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children 
would color in the coloring room, paint in the painting room, play 
with 
blocks in the block house, and do all the other things in the proper 
rooms at exactly the right time. Their two boys were "well adjusted" 
and, like their parents, always did the right thing at the right 
time and damn the consequences.   Francesca and Herbert considered 
themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were 
by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings 
and other art objects (expensive, but not necessarily valuable, contemporary 
things). Fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against 
the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by 
wearing Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in <color>; bright 
pinks and plaids and vivid stripes. Sometimes she even wore the uniform 
in solid, unrelieved black, and with her blonde hair cut so closely, 
wearing this uniform, she strongly resembled a member of the 
SS&.

No one could dislike them, I thought. Sometimes, though, they 
did not seem quite human. It seemed, indeed, that their house was 
not so much a home, but rather a perfect stage set, and that they were 
actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play, and had talent 
enough to fill the roles competently, with nice understatement. Practically 
the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing 
"names"; even brand names. You should hear the reverence in 
Fran's voice when she said "Baccarat" or "Steuben" or "Madame 
Alexander". She always let it be known that there was wine 
in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy, and 
that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs.

I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not 
for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally 
unreal. I couldn't feel at home among them. Besides Francesca, 
there was Blanche. Francesca was pleasant and charming, but Blanche 
was sweet. Yes, Blanche was very, very sweet- being in her company 
was like being drowned in warm, melted marshmallows. I had once been 
a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness, 
"Oh, my souffle has collapsed". <Anyone> knows how a real, 
red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe! If Blanche 
had been honest, she would have yelled, slammed at least a couple of 
doors, and thrown a few little, valueless things. But dear me, no; 
not Blanche.   After five minutes with Blanche, one might welcome 
the astringency 
of Grazie, who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz to Francesca's 
Perle Mesta. Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee 
chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen, equal 
bosses, of whatever ~PTA or civic project was being launched. They
