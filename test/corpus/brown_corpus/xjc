that the pattern of predisposition prevailing in positions of strength 
in future crises can be favorably affected.   Now an abiding 
difficulty of paragraphs like the foregoing is that they appear to preach; 
and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation 
of the goodness of the good. In any case I do not intend to 
let the present occasion pass without dealing more directly with the 
problem of implementing good intentions. I assume that the number of 
readers of this anthology who regard themselves as morally perfect is 
small, and that most readers are willing to consider procedures by which 
they may gain more insight into themselves and better understanding 
of others. Properly used, the present book is an excellent instrument 
of enlightenment.   Let us not confuse the issue by labeling 
the objective or the method "psychoanalytic", for this is a well established 
term of art for the specific ideas and procedures initiated 
by Sigmund Freud and his followers for the study and treatment of disordered 
personalities. The traditional method proceeds by the technique 
of free association, punctuated by interpretations proposed by the 
psychoanalytic interviewer.   What we have in mind does have 
something in common with the goals of psychoanalysis and with the methods 
by which they are sought. For what we propose, however, a psychoanalyst 
is not necessary, even though one aim is to enable the reader to 
get beneath his own defenses- his defenses of himself to himself. 
For this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement is 
necessary; but involvement needs to be accompanied by a special frame 
of mind.   The relatively long and often colorful selections 
in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorbed in 
what is said, whether he responds with anger or applause. But simple 
involvement is not enough; self-discovery calls for an open, permissive, 
inquiring posture of self-observation.   The symposium provides 
an opportunity to confront the self with specific statements which 
were made at particular times by identifiable communicators who were 
addressing definite audiences- and throughout several hundred pages 
everyone is talking about the same key symbol of identification.

An advantage of being exposed to such specificity about an important 
and recurring feature of social reality is that it can be taken advantage 
of by the reader to examine covert as well as overt resonances 
within himself, resonances triggered by explicit symbols clustering around 
the central figure of the Jew.

Two facets of this aspect of the literary process have special 
significance for our time. One, a reservation on the point I have just 
made, is the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking, pseudo-feeling, and pseudo-willing, 
which Fromm discussed in <The Escape from Freedom>. 
In essence this involves grounding one's thought and emotion in the 
values and experience of others, rather than in one's own values 
and experience. There is a risk that instead of teaching a person how 
to be himself, 
reading fiction and drama may teach him how to be somebody 
else. Clearly what the person brings to the reading is important. 
Moreover, if the critic instructs his audience in <what> to see in 
a work, he is contributing to this pseudo-thinking; if he instructs 
them in <how> to evaluate a work, he is helping them to achieve their 
own identity.   The second timely part of this sketch of literature 
and the search for identity has to do with the difference between 
good and enduring literary works and the ephemeral mass culture products 
of today. In the range and variety of characters who, in their 
literary lives, get along all right with life styles one never imagined 
possible, there is an implicit lesson in differentiation. The reader, 
observing this process, might ask "why not be different"? and 
find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species. 
The observer of television or other products for a mass audience has 
only a permit to be, like the models he sees, even more like everybody 
else. And this, I think, holds for values as well as life styles. 
One would need to test this proposition carefully; after all, the large 
(and probably unreliable) <Reader's Digest> literature on the 
"most unforgettable character I ever met" deals with village grocers, 
country doctors, favorite if illiterate aunts, and so forth. Scientists 
often turn out to be idiosyncratic, too. But still, the proposition 
is worth examination.   It is possible that the study 
of literature affects the conscience, the morality, the sensitivity to 
some code of "right" and "wrong". I do not know that this is 
true; both Flu^gel and Ranyard West deal with the development 
and nature of conscience, as do such theologians as Niebuhr and Buber. 
It forms the core of many, perhaps most, problems of psychotherapy. 
I am not aware of great attention by any of these authors or by the 
psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development 
of conscience- most of their attention is to a pre-literate 
period of life, or, for the theologians of course, to the influence 
of religion.   Still, it would be surprising if what one reads did 
not contribute to one's ideas of right and wrong; certainly the 
awakened alarm over the comic books and the continuous concern over prurient 
literature indicate some peripheral aspects of this influence. 
Probably the most important thing to focus on is not the development 
of conscience, which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature, 
but the contents of conscience, the code which is imparted to the developed 
or immature conscience available. This is in large part a code 
of behavior and a glossary of values: what is it that people do and 
should do and how one should regard it. In a small way this is illustrated 
by the nineteenth-century novelist who argued for the powerful 
influence of literature as a teacher of society and who illustrated 
this with the way a girl learned to meet her lover, how to behave, how 
to think about this new experience, how to exercise restraint.

Literature may be said to give people a sense of purpose, dedication, 
mission, significance. This, no doubt, is part of what Gilbert Seldes 
implies when he says of the arts, "They give form and meaning 
to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense". Men 
seem almost universally to want a sense of function, that is, a feeling 
that their existence makes a difference to someone, living or unborn, 
close and immediate or generalized. Feeling useless seems generally 
to be an unpleasant sensation. A need so deeply planted, asking 
for direction, so to speak, is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples 
and heroic proportions of literature. The terms "renewal" 
and "refreshed", which often come up in aesthetic discussion, seem 
partly to derive their import from the "renewal" of purpose and 
a "refreshed" sense of significance a person may receive from poetry, 
drama, and fiction. The notion of "inspiration" is somehow cognate 
to this feeling. How literature does this, or for whom, is certainly 
not clear, but the content, form, and language of the "message", 
as well as the source, would all play differentiated parts in giving 
and molding a sense of purpose.   One of the most salient features 
of literary value has been deemed to be its influence upon and 
organization of emotion. Let us differentiate a few of these ideas. The 
Aristotelian notion of catharsis, the purging of emotion, is a persistent 
and viable one. The idea here is one of <discharge> but this 
must stand in opposition to a second view, Plato's notion of the 
<arousal> of emotion. A third idea is that artistic literature serves 
to <reduce emotional conflicts,> giving a sense of serenity and 
calm to individuals. This is given some expression in Beardsley's 
notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision. A fourth view is 
the transformation of emotion, as in Housman's fine phrase on the 
arts: they "transform and beautify our inner nature". It is possible 
that the idea of <enrichment> of emotion is a fifth idea. F&S&C& 
Northrop, in his discussion of the "Functions and Future 
of Poetry", suggests this: "One of the things which makes 
our lives drab and empty and which leaves us, at the end of the day, 
fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure of the taxing, practical, 
utilitarian concern of common-sense objects. If art is to release 
us from these postulated things [things we must think symbolically 
about] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the 
aesthetic component of reality in its immediacy, it must sever its connection 
with these common sense entities". I take the central meaning 
here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without 
literature and a life enriched by it. Richards' view of the aesthetic 
experience might constitute a sixth variety: for him it constitutes, 
in part, the <organization of impulses>.   A sketch of 
the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account 
of all of these. But there is one in particular which, it seems 
to me, deserves special attention. In the wide range of experiences 
common to our earth-bound race none is more difficult to manage, more 
troublesome, and more enduring in its effects than the control of love 
and hate. The study of literature contributes to this control in a curious 
way. William Wimsatt and Cleanth Brooks, it seems to me, have 
a penetrating insight into the way in which this control is effected: 
"For if we say poetry is to talk of beauty and love (and yet not 
aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of Platonic esteem) 
and if it is to talk of anger and murder (and yet not aim at arousing 
anger and indignation)- then it may be that the poetic way of dealing 
with these emotions will not be any kind of intensification, compounding, 
or magnification, or any direct assault upon the affections 
at all. Something indirect, mixed, reconciling, tensional might well 
be the strategem, the devious technique by which a poet indulged in all 
kinds of talk about love and anger and even in something like "expressions" 
of these emotions, without aiming at their incitement or 
even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement". 
The rehearsal through literature of emotional life under controlled conditions 
may be a most valuable human experience. Here I do not mean 
catharsis, the discharge of emotion. I mean something more like Freud's 
concept of the utility of "play" to a small child: he plays 
"house" or "doctor" or "fireman" as a way of mastering 
slightly frightening experiences, reliving them imaginatively until they 
are under control.   There is a second feature of the influences 
of literature, good literature, on emotional life which may have 
some special value for our time. In B& M& Spinley's portrayal 
of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of London, a salient 
finding was the inability to postpone gratification, a need to satisfy 
impulses immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring 
the experience. Perhaps it is only an analogy, but one of the most 
obvious differences between cheap fiction and fiction of an enduring 
quality is the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation. 
Anyone who has watched children develop a taste for literature 
will understand what I mean. It is at least possible that the capacity 
to postpone gratification is developed as well as expressed in 
a continuous and guided exposure to great literature.   In any 
inquiry into the way in which great literature affects the emotions, particularly 
with respect to the sense of harmony, or relief of tension, 
or sense of "a transformed inner nature" which may occur, a most 
careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which 
produces the effect would be required. In the calm which follows the 
reading of a poem, for example, is the effect produced by the enforced 
quiet, by the musical quality of words and rhythm, by the sentiments 
or sense of the poem, by the associations with earlier readings, if it 
is familiar, by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate, 
by 
the diversion of attention, by the sense of security in a legitimized 
withdrawal, by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regarded 
as forbidden, or by half-conscious ideas about the magical power of 
words? These are, if the research is done with subtlety and skill, 
researchable topics, but the research is missing.   One of the 
most frequent views of the value of literature is the education of sensibility 
that it is thought to provide. Sensibility is a vague word, 
covering an area of meaning rather than any precise talent, quality, 
or skill. Among other things it means perception, discrimination, sensitivity 
to subtle differences. Both the extent to which this is true 
and the limits of the field of perceptual skill involved should be acknowledged. 
Its truth is illustrated by the skill, sensitivity, and general 
expertise of the English professor with whom one attends the theatre. 
The limits are suggested by an imaginary experiment: contrast 
the perceptual skill of English professors with that of their colleagues
