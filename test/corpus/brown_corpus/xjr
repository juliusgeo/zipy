was turned into an arena of rejoicing. Even the dignified Washington 
indulged in a game of wickets with some children. His soldiers on the 
whole did not celebrate so mildly. On May 6th, Morgan, who had returned, 
received from Washington orders to "send out patrols under 
vigilant officers" to keep near the enemy. "The reason for this", 
the orders said, "is that the enemy may think to take advantage of 
the celebration of this day. The troops must have more than the common 
quantity of liquor, and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness 
among them".   Apparently no serious disorders resulted from 
the celebration, and within a few days, Morgan joined the force of 
Lafayette who now had command of some 2,000 men at Barren Hill, not 
far above Philadelphia on the Schuylkill. The Frenchman had been 
ordered to approach the enemy's lines, harass them and get intelligence 
of their movements. Interestingly enough, the order transmitted 
to Morgan through Alexander Hamilton also informed him that "A party 
of Indians will join the party to be sent from your command at Whitemarsh, 
and act with them". These were Oneida Indians. 
Washington evidently was anxious for Morgan to be cautious as well 
as aggressive, for on May 17th, 18th and 20th he admonished the leader 
of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert. Obviously the commander-in-chief 
had confidence that Morgan would furnish him good intelligence 
too, for on the 23rd of May, he told Morgan that the British were 
prepared to move, perhaps in the night, and asked Morgan to have two 
of his best horses ready to dispatch to General Smallwood with the 
intelligence obtained. Meantime, however, this same General Smallwood 
seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the American army. Colonel 
Benjamin Ford wrote to Morgan from Wilmington that he understood 
a Mrs& Sanderson from Maryland had obtained permission from Smallwood 
to visit Philadelphia, and would return on May 26th, escorted 
by several officers from Maryland "belonging to the new levies 
in the British service". Ford urged Morgan to capture these men, 
who, he thought, might be disguised as Quakers or peasants. Morgan took 
the suggested steps, but when Mrs& Sanderson appeared, there was 
nobody with her but her husband, whom he promptly sent to headquarters 
to be questioned. But Morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence 
much more important to his commanding general. A letter of a 
few days later from Washington's aide to Morgan stated, "His Excellency 
is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion". 
For by now the original cause of the quarrel, Philip's seizure of 
Gascony, was only one strand in the spider web of French interests that 
overlay all western Europe and that had been so well and closely 
spun that the lightest movement could set it trembling from one end to 
the other. Even so, Edward's ambassadors can scarcely have foreseen 
that five years of unremitting work lay ahead of them before peace 
was finally made and that when it did come the countless embassies that 
left England for Rome during that period had very little to do with 
it.   It is hard not to lay most of the blame for their failures 
on the pope. Nogaret is hardly an impartial witness, and even he 
did 
not make his charges against Boniface until the latter was dead, but 
there is some truth in what he said and more in what he did not say. 
It was not merely a hunger for "money, gold and precious objects" 
that delayed the papal pronouncement that could have brought the war 
to an end; the pope was playing a dangerous game, with so many balls 
in the air at once that a misstep would bring them all about his ears, 
and his only hope was to temporize so that he could take advantage 
of every change in the delicate balance of European affairs. When the 
negotiations began, his quarrel with the king of France was temporarily 
in abeyance, and he had no intention of reviving it so long as there 
was hope that French money would come to pay the troops who, under 
Charles of Valois, 
the papal vicar of Tuscany, were so valuable in 
the crusade against the Colonna cardinals and their Sicilian allies. 
If his circumspection in regard to Philip's sensibilities went so 
far that he even refused to grant a dispensation for the marriage of 
Amadee's daughter, Agnes, to the son of the dauphin of Vienne- 
a truly peacemaking move according to thirteenth-century ideas, for Savoy 
and Dauphine were as usual fighting on opposite sides- for fear 
that he might seem to be favoring the anti-French coalition, he would 
certainly never take the far more drastic step of ordering the return 
of Gascony to Edward, even though, as he admitted to the English 
ambassadors, he had been advised that the original cession was invalid. 
On the other hand, he did not want to offend Edward either, and 
he found himself in a very difficult position. On the surface, the whole 
question was purely feudal. The French were now occupying Gascony 
and Flanders on the technical grounds that their rulers had forfeited 
them by a breach of the feudal contract. But Edward was invading 
Scotland for precisely the same reason, and his insubordinate vassal 
was the ally of the king of France. Boniface had to uphold the sacredness 
of the feudal contract at all costs, for it was only as suzerain 
of Sicily and of the Patrimony of Peter that he had any justification 
for his Italian wars, but in the English-Scottish-French triangle 
it was almost impossible for him to recognize the claims of any one 
of the contestants without seeming to invalidate those of the other 
two.   Because of these involvements in the matter at stake, Boniface 
lacked the impartiality that is supposed to be an essential qualification 
for the position of arbiter, and in retrospect that would 
seem to be 
sufficient reason why the English embassies to the Curia proved 
so fruitless. But when the situation was so complicated that even 
Nogaret, one of the principal actors in the drama, could misinterpret 
the pope's motives, it is possible that Othon and his companions, 
equally baffled, attributed their difficulties to a more immediate cause. 
This was Boniface's monumental tactlessness. "Tact", by 
its very derivation, implies that its possessor keeps in touch with other 
people, but the author of <Clericis Laicos> and <Unam Sanctam>, 
the wielder of the two swords, the papal sun of which the imperial 
moon was but a dim reflection, the peer of Caesar and vice-regent 
of Christ, was so high above other human beings that he had forgotten 
what they were like. He was a learned and brilliant man, one of the 
best jurists in Europe and with flashes of penetrating insight, and yet 
in his dealings with other people, particularly when he tried to be 
ingratiating, he was capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come 
only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motives.

This lofty disregard for others was not shared by such men 
as Pierre Flotte and his associates, that "brilliant group of mediocre 
men", as Powicke calls them, who provided the brains for the 
French embassy that came to Rome under the nominal leadership of the 
archbishop of Narbonne, the duke of Burgundy, and the count of St&-Pol. 
They had risen from humble beginnings by their own diligence 
and astuteness, they were unfettered by the codes that bound nobles 
like Othon or even the older generation of clerks like Hotham, and 
they were working for an end that their opponents had never even visualized. 
Boniface was later to explain to the English that Robert 
of Burgundy and Guy de St&-Pol were easy enough to do business with; 
it was the clerks who caused the mischief and who made him say 
that the ruling passion of their race was covetousness and that in dealing 
with them he never knew whether he had to do with a Frenchman or 
with a devil. To the pope, head of the universal Church, to the duke 
of Burgundy, taking full advantage of his position on the borders 
of France and of the Empire, or to Othon, who found it quite natural 
that he should do homage to Edward for Tipperary and to the count 
of Savoy for Grandson, Flotte's outspoken nationalism was completely 
incomprehensible. And yet he made no pretense about it; when 
the pope, trying no doubt to appeal to his better nature, said to him, 
"You have already taken Normandy. Do you want to drive the king 
of England from all his overseas possessions"? the Frenchman's 
answer was a terse "Vous dites vrai". Loyal and unscrupulous, 
with a single-minded ambition to which he devoted all his energies, he 
outmatched the English diplomats time and time again until, by a kind 
of poetic justice, he fell at the battle of Courtrai, the victim of 
the equally nationalistic if less articulate Flemings.   The 
English, relying on a prejudiced arbiter and confronted with superior 
diplomatic skill, were also hampered in their negotiations by the events 
that were taking place at home. The Scots had found a new leader 
in William Wallace, and Edward's yearly expeditions across the Border 
called for evermounting taxes, which only increased his difficulties 
with the barons and the clergy. He was unable to send any more 
help to his allies on the Continent, and during the next few years many 
of them, left to resist French pressure unaided, surrendered to the 
inevitable and made their peace with Philip. The defeat and death 
of Adolf 
of Nassau at the hands of Albert of Habsburg also worked to 
the disadvantage of the English, for all the efforts to revive the 
anti-French coalition came to nothing when Philip made an alliance with 
the new king of the Romans.   These shifts in alliance and 
allegiance not only increased the difficulties confronting the English 
embassy as a whole, but also directly involved the two Savoyards, Amadee 
and Othon. In spite of the armistice negotiated by Amadee two 
years earlier, the war between Bishop Guillaume of Lausanne and Louis 
of Savoy was still going on, and although little is known about 
it, that little proves that it was yet another phase of the struggle 
against French expansion and was closely interwoven with the larger conflict. 
A second truce had been arbitrated in April, 1298, by Jean 
d'Arlay, lord of Chalon-sur-Saone, the most staunch of 
Edward's 
Burgundian allies, and these last were represented in the discussions 
at the Curia by Gautier de Montfaucon, Othon's neighbor and a 
member of the Vaudois coalition.   But although in many of these 
discussions Othon and Amadee might have been tempted to consider 
their own interests as well as those of the king, Edward's confidence 
in them was so absolute that they were made the acknowledged leaders 
of the embassy. Amadee may have owed this partly to his relationship 
with the king, but Othon, who at sixty seems still to have been a simple 
knight, merited his position solely by his own character and ability. 
The younger men, Vere, and Pembroke, who was also Edward's 
cousin and whose Lusignan blood gave him the swarthy complexion that 
caused Edward of Carnarvon's irreverent friend, Piers Gaveston, 
to nickname him "Joseph the Jew", were relatively new to the game 
of diplomacy, but Pontissara had been on missions to Rome before, 
and Hotham, a man of great learning, "jocund in speech, agreeable 
to meet, of honest religion, and pleasing in the eyes of all", and an 
archbishop to boot, was as reliable and experienced as Othon himself. 
But all the reports of this first embassy show that the two Savoyards 
were the heads of it, for they were the only ones who were empowered 
to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope's decision 
and who were allowed to appoint deputies in the event that one was unavoidably 
absent.   This also gave them the unpleasant duty of 
being spokesmen for the mission, and they could foresee that that would 
not be easy. Underneath all the high-sounding phrases of royal and 
papal letters and behind the more down-to-earth instructions to the envoys 
was the inescapable fact that Edward would have to desert his Flemish 
allies and leave them to the vengeance of their indignant suzerain, 
the king of France, in return for being given an equally free hand 
with the insubordinate Scots. This was a doubly bitter blow to the 
king. In the eyes of those who still cared for such things, it was 
a reflection on his honor, and it gave further grounds for complaint to 
his overtaxed subjects, who were already grumbling- although probably 
not in Latin- "Non est lex sana Quod regi sit mea lana". 
Bad relations between England and Flanders brought hard times to the 
shepherds scattered over the dales and downs as well as to the crowded 
Flemish cities, and while the English, so far, had done no more than 
grumble, Othon had seen what the discontent might lead to, for before 
he left the Low Countries the citizens of Ghent had risen in protest 
against the expense of supporting Edward and his troops, and the 
regular soldiers had found it unexpectedly difficult to put down the 
nasty little riot that ensued.   In all the talk of feudal rights, 
the knights and bishops must never forget the woolworkers, nor was 
it easy to do so, for all along the road to Italy they passed the Florentine
