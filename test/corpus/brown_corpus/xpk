work. This air of disengagement carried over to his apparent attitude 
toward his things, and people often mistook it for boredom in him 
or a surrender to repetitious routine. But he was not bored at 
all; 
he had found his style quite early in his career and he thought it quite 
wonderful that the world admired it, and he could not imagine why he 
should alter it. There are, after all, fortunate souls who hear everything, 
but only know how to listen to what is good for them, and Stowey 
was, as things go, a fortunate man.   He left his home the 
day after New Year's wearing a mackinaw and sheepskin mittens and 
without a hat. He would wear this same costume in Florida, despite his 
wife Cleota's reminders over the past five days that he must take 
some cool clothes with him. But he was too busy to hear what she was 
saying. So they parted when she was in an impatient humor. When he 
was bent over behind the wheel of the station wagon, feeling in his trouser 
cuffs for the ignition key which he had dropped a moment before, 
she came out of the house with an enormous Rumanian shawl over her 
head, which she had bought in that country during one of their trips abroad, 
and handed him a clean handkerchief through the window. Finding 
the key under his shoe, he started the engine, and while it warmed up 
he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog, and said, "Defrost 
the refrigerator".   He saw the surprise in her face, and 
laughed as though it were the funniest expression he had ever seen. 
He kept on laughing until she started laughing with him. He had a deep 
voice which was full of good food she had cooked, and good humor; 
an explosive laugh which always carried everything before it. He would 
settle himself into his seat to laugh. Whenever he laughed it was 
all he was doing. And she was made to fall in love with him again there 
in the rutted dirt driveway standing in the cold fog, mad as she was 
at his going away when he really didn't have to, mad at their both 
having got older in a life that seemed to have taken no more than a 
week to go by. She was forty-nine at this time, a lanky woman of breeding 
with an austere, narrow face which had the distinction of a steeple 
or some architecture that had been designed long ago for a stubborn 
sort of prayer. Her eyebrows were definite and heavy and formed two 
lines moving upward toward a high forehead and a great head of brown hair 
that fell to her shoulders. There was an air of blindness in her 
gray eyes, the startled-horse look that ultimately comes to some women 
who are born at the end of an ancestral line long since divorced from 
money-making and which, besides, has kept its estate intact. She was 
personally sloppy, and when she had colds would blow her nose in the 
same handkerchief all day and keep it, soaking wet, dangling from her 
waist, and when she gardened she would eat dinner with dirt on her calves. 
But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity of peasanthood 
she would disappear and come down bathed, brushed, and taking 
breaths of air, and even with her broken nails her hands would come to 
rest on a table or a leaf with a thoughtless delicacy, a grace of history, 
so to speak, and for an instant one saw how ferociously proud she 
was and adamant on certain questions of personal value. She even spoke 
differently when she was clean, and she was clean now for his departure 
and her voice clear and rather sharp.   "Now drive carefully, 
for God's sake"! she called, trying to attain a half humorous 
resentment at his departure. But he did not notice, and was already 
backing the car down to the road, saying "Toot-toot"! to the 
stump of a tree as he passed it, the same stump which had impaled the 
car of many a guest in the past thirty years and which he refused to 
have removed. She stood clutching her shawl around her shoulders until 
he had swung the car onto the road. Then, when he had it pointed 
down the hill, he stopped to gaze at her through the window. She had 
begun to turn back toward the house, but his look caught her and she stood 
still, waiting there for what his expression indicated would be 
a 
serious word of farewell. He looked at her out of himself, she thought, 
as he did only for an instant at a time, the look which always surprised 
her even now when his uncombable hair was yellowing a little and 
his breath came hard through his nicotine-choked lungs, the look of the 
gaunt youth she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate 
Gallery on a Thursday once. Now she kept herself protectively ready 
to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger 
and said "Toot"! once more and roared off into the fog, his foot 
evidently surprising him with the suddenness with which it pressed 
the accelerator, just as his hand did when he worked. She walked back 
to the house and entered, feeling herself returning, sensing some kind 
of opportunity in the empty building. There is a death in all partings, 
she knew, and promptly put it out of her mind.   She enjoyed 
great parties when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking 
all night, but it always seemed to her that being alone, especially 
alone in her house, was the realest part of life. Now she could let out 
the three parakeets without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey 
would let them out one of the doors; she could dust the plants, 
then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel and read from the 
middle 
on; improvise cha-chas on the harp; and finally, the best part of 
all, simply sit at the plank table in the kitchen with a bottle of wine 
and the newspapers, reading the ads as well as the news, registering 
nothing on her mind but letting her soul suspend itself above all wishing 
and desire. She did this now, comfortably aware of the mist running 
down the windows, of the silence outside, of the dark afternoon 
it was getting to be. She fell asleep leaning on her hand, hearing the 
house creaking as though it were a living a private life of its own 
these two hundred years, hearing the birds rustling in their cages and 
the occasional whirring of wings as one of them landed on the table and 
walked across the newspaper to perch in the crook of her arm. Every 
few minutes she would awaken for a moment to review things: Stowey, 
yes, was on his way south, and the two boys were away in school, and 
nothing was burning on the stove, and Lucretia was coming for dinner 
and bringing three guests of hers. Then she fell asleep again as soddenly 
as a person with fever, and when she awoke it was dark outside 
and the clarity was back in her eyes. She stood up, smoothing her hair 
down, straightening her clothes, feeling a thankfulness for the enveloping 
darkness outside, and, above everything else, for the absence of 
the need to answer, to respond, to be aware even of Stowey coming in 
or going out, and yet, now that she was beginning to cook, she glimpsed 
a future without him, a future alone like this, and the pain made her 
head writhe, and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia 
to come with her guests. She went into the living room and turned on 
three lamps, then back into the kitchen where she turned on the ceiling 
light and the switch that lit the floods on the barn, illuminating 
the driveway. She knew she was feeling afraid and inwardly laughed at 
herself. They were both so young, after all, so unready for any final 
parting. How could it have been thirty years already, she wondered? 
But yes, nineteen plus thirty was forty-nine, and she was forty-nine 
and she had been married at nineteen. She stood still over the leg 
of lamb, rubbing herbs into it, quite suddenly conscious of a nausea 
in her stomach and a feeling of wrath, a sensation of violence that started 
her shivering.

But they all said, "No, your time will come. Enjoy being a 
bride while you can".   There was no room for company in the 
tiny Weaning House (where the Albright boys always took their brides, 
till they could get a house and a farm of their own). So when the 
Big House filled up and ran over, the sisters-in-law found beds for 
everyone in their own homes. And there was still not anything that Linda 
Kay could do.   So Linda Kay gave up asking, and accepted 
her reprieve. Without saying so, she was really grateful; for to 
attend the dying was something she had never experienced, and certainly 
had not imagined when she thought of the duties she would have as Bobby 
Joe's wife. She had made curtains for all the windows of her 
little house, and she had kept it spotless and neat, shabby as it was, 
and cooked good meals for Bobby Joe. She had done all the things she 
had promised herself she would do, but she had not thought of this. 
People died, she would have said, in hospitals, or in cars on the highway 
at night.   Bobby Joe was gone all day now, not coming in 
for dinner and sometimes not for supper. When they first married he 
had been working in the fields all day, and she would get in the car and 
drive to wherever he was working, to take him a fresh hot meal. Now 
there was no work in the fields, nor would there be till it rained, 
and she did not know where he went. Not that she complained, or had any 
cause to. Four or five of the cousins from East Texas were about 
his age, so naturally they ran around together. There was no reason 
for her to ask what they did.   Thus a new pattern of days began 
to develop, for Granny Albright did not die. She lay still on the 
bed, her head hardly denting the pillow; sometimes she opened her eyes 
and looked around, and sometimes she took a little milk or soup. They 
stopped expecting her to die the next minute, but only in the next 
day or two. Those who had driven hundreds of miles for the burial would 
not go home, for she might die any time; but they might as well 
unpack their suitcases, for she might linger on.   So the pattern 
was established. When Linda Kay had put up her breakfast dishes 
and mopped her linoleum rugs, she would go to the Big House. There 
was not anything she could do there, but that was where everyone was, 
or would be. Bobby Joe and the boys would come by, say "How's Granny"? 
and sit on the porch a while. The older men would be there 
at noon, and maybe rest for a time before they took their guns off 
to the creek or drove down the road towards town.   The women and 
children stayed at the Albrights'. The women, keeping their voices 
low as they worked around the house or sat in the living room, sounded 
like chickens shut up in a coop for the night. The children had to 
play away from the house (in the barn loft or the pasture behind the 
barn), to maintain a proper quietness.   Off and on, all day, someone 
would be wiping at the powdery gray dust that settled over everything. 
The evaporative cooler had been moved to Granny's room, and 
her door was kept shut; so that the rest of the house stayed open, 
though there was a question as to whether it was hotter or cooler that 
way.   The dust clogged their throats, and the heat parched them, 
so that the women were always making ice water. They had cleaned 
up an old ice box and begun to buy fifty-pound blocks of ice in town, 
as the electric refrigerator came nowhere near providing enough ice for 
the crowds who ate and drank there.   One afternoon, as the women 
sat clucking softly, a new carload of people pulled up at the gate. 
It was a Cadillac, black grayed with the dust of the road, its windows 
closed tight so you knew that the people who climbed out of it would 
be cool and unwrinkled. They were an old fat couple (as Linda Kay 
described them to herself), a thick middle-aged man, and a girl about 
ten or twelve.   There was much embracing, much exclaiming. "Cousin 
Ada! Cousin John"! "Cousin Lura"! "Cousin 
Howard"! "And how is she"? "About the same, John, 
about 
the same".   All the women got up and offered their chairs, and 
when they were all seated again, the guests made their inquiries and 
their explanations.   "We were on our vacation in Canada", 
Howard explained, in a muffled voice that must have been used to booming, 
"and the news didn't catch up with us till we were nearly home. 
We came on as soon as we could".   There was the suggestion 
of ice water, and- in spite of the protest "We're not really 
thirsty"- Linda Kay, to escape the stuffy air and the smothering 
soft voices, hurried to the kitchen.   She filled a big pitcher 
and set it, with glasses, on a tray. Carrying it to the living room, 
she imagined the picture she made: tall and roundly slim, a bit sophisticated 
in her yellow sheath, with a graceful swingy walk that she 
had learned as a twirler with the school band. Almost immediately she 
was ashamed of herself for feeling vain, at such a time, in such a 
place, and she tossed back her long yellow hair, smiling shyly as she 
entered the room.   Howard (the thick middle-aged man) was looking 
at her. She felt the look and looked back because she could not help 
it, seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first 
believed.   "And who is this"? he asked, when she passed 
him a glass.   "Oh that's Linda Kay", Mama Albright 
said fondly. "She married our baby boy, Bobby Joe, this summer".
