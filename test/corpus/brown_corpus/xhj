and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped 
to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications, 
resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions. Immediately, the 
film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content 
based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time. 
Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected 
one at a time at such a speed that the eye "remembers" the one 
that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing. Linking 
the smoothly changing images together, the eye itself endows them 
with the illusion of movement. The "projection" time of painting 
and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and 
even varying for a given person on different occasions. So is the time 
of the novel. The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall 
both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the 
players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore, 
to much variation, as record collectors well know. The time of the motion 
picture is fixed absolutely. The film consists of a series of still, 
transparent photographs, or "frames", 35-mm&-wide. Each frame 
comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected 
on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second, 
and, for sound films, 24 frames per second. This is the rate of projection; 
it is also the rate of photographing. Time is built into 
the motion picture, which cannot exist without time. Now time is also 
the concern of the fictional narrative, which is, at its simplest, 
the story of an action with, usually, a beginning, a middle, and an end- 
elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence. 
The "moving" picture of the train or the wave coming at the 
audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same 
subject, but the difference is really one of degree; the cinematic 
element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which 
would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo. In narrative, 
time is essential, as it is in film. Almost everything about the 
movies that is peculiarly <of> the movies derives from a tension created 
and maintained between narrative time and film time. This discovery 
of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling, 
magician's tricks produced on film.   It was Porter, however, 
who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the 
half century of film history that has since ensued. The movie was <The 
Great Train Robbery> and its effects on the young industry and 
art were all but incalculable. Overnight, for one thing, Porter's 
film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten. <The 
Great Train Robbery> is a one-reel film. One reel- from eight to 
twelve minutes- became the standard length from the year of <Robbery>, 
1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with <Birth of 
a Nation> in 1915. The reel itself became and still is the standard 
of measure for the movies.   The material of the Porter film 
is simplicity itself; much of it has continued to be used over the 
years and the heart of it- good guys and bad guys in the old West- 
pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's. A 
band of robbers enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the 
telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes. A posse is formed 
and pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape, are whooping 
it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out. The robbers 
run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot 
dead by the posse. As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the 
band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.

All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did 
two important things that had not been done before. Each scene is shot 
straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed 
in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the 
capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position 
breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which 
had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at 
a play. The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the 
plane of the film in the camera or on the screen. If the change, at 
first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters 
about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian 
painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of 
geniuses any art has seen. In that apparently simple shift Porter 
opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of 
art as well as a mechanical recording device.   He did more than 
that. He revealed the potential value of the "cut" as the basic 
technique in the art of the film. Cutting, of course, takes place automatically 
in the creation of a film. The meaning of the word is quite 
physical, to begin with. The physical film is cut with a knife at the 
end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically, 
by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence. If, 
as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable footage of your child 
taking its first steps, you have merely recorded an historical event. 
If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends, 
you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's 
grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in 
film; you are employing the basic technique of film; you are cutting.

This is what Porter did. As the robbers leave the looted 
train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's 
little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only 
to find him bound on the floor. She dashes around in alarm. The two 
events are taking place at the same time. Time and space have both become 
cinematic. We leap from event to event- including the formation 
of the posse- even though the events, in "reality" are taking 
place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but 
at a considerable distance.   The "chase" as a standard film 
device probably dates from <The Great Train Robbery>, and there 
is a reason for the continued popularity of the device. The chase in 
itself is a narrative; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands 
cutting- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage 
of the journey of both. The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another 
is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other 
form of fiction. The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and 
the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not 
only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence; 
these films and these sequences are also seeking out- instinctively 
or by design- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative. 

#THE CREATOR OF THE ART OF THE FILM: D&W&GRIFFITH#

There 
still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full 
potential of the new form and to make it an art. The man was D&W& 
Griffith. When he came to the movies- more or less by accident- 
they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking 
for an idle few minutes. In about seven years Griffith either 
invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource 
at the disposal of the film maker. Before he was forty Griffith 
had created the art of the film.   Not that there had not been 
attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that. But in general the European 
efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly 
emerging language of the film itself. Staggeringly condensed versions 
of famous novels and famous plays were presented. Great actors 
and actresses- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt- were hired 
to repeat their stage performances before the camera. In all of this 
extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status 
of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor 
or by the author. The phonograph today, for all its high fidelity 
and stereophonic sound, is precisely what the early art purveyors in 
the movies wished to make of the camera. Not surprisingly, this approach 
did not work. The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques 
in the early years of the century and some interesting records 
of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names. But no art 
at all was born of the art effort in the early movies. 
In general, religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis; 
congregational membership, however, is another thing. A congregation 
survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership; 
that is, when it can preserve economic integration. Religious 
faith can be considered a <necessary> condition of membership in 
a congregation, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires 
some motive force, but faith is not a <sufficient> condition for joining; 
the presence of other members of similar social and economic 
level is the <sufficient> condition.   The breakdown of social 
homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account 
for the decline of central city churches. Central cities reveal 
two adverse features for the major denominations: (1) central cities 
tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes; (2) central 
cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition. The central 
city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics which 
violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations: 
they have too few middle-class people; they mix middle-class people 
with lower-class residents. Central city areas have become progressively 
poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus 
of middle-class people from most central cities. With few exceptions, 
the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central 
city.   The key to Protestant development, therefore, is economic 
integration of the nucleus of the congregation. Members of higher 
and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus, so that Protestant 
figures on social class give the impression of spread over all 
social classes; but this is deceptive, for the core of membership 
is 
concentrated in a single social and economic stratum. The congregation 
perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the 
neighborhood; moreover, residential mobility is so high in metropolitan 
areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum 
in order to survive; they can lose higher- and lower-status members 
from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits 
for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration. The 
congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group; it is 
secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship. If it were primarily 
a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social 
and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism 
(with a few notable exceptions) have not been able to do. 
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.

The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences 
has often been attributed to the "folksy spirit" of Protestant 
religious life; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard 
with the "impersonal" Roman Catholic parish. We have seen that 
the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers; consequently, the 
vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress 
on personal community in Protestant congregations; actually, there 
is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations, 
as we shall see in another connection. The vulnerability of 
Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of 
the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is 
a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore, 
to the principle of economic integration. This fact is evident 
in the recruitment of new members. 

#MISSION AS CO-OPTATION#

The 
rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the 
missionary outreach of the major denominations. There is much talk 
in theological circles about the "Church as Mission" and the "Church's 
Mission"; theologians have been stressing the fact that 
the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in 
the world for the healing of the world. A crucial question, therefore, 
is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism. 
If economic integration really shapes congregational life, then 
evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration.
