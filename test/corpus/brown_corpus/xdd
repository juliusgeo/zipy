of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape 
channels. These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active 
co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two 
channels which are impressed on the record. In some of the numbers 
the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and 
then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects.

Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs 
may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include 
the word "percussion" or "percussive". Drums, xylophones, 
castanets, and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably 
well. Only too often, however, you have the feeling that you are sitting 
in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your 
left and others facing them on the wall to your right. They are definitely 
in the same room with you, but your head starts to swing as 
though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a 
spirited volley.   {The Percussive Twenties} (~SP-44006) 
stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day, and Johnny 
Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in {Percussive 
Moods} (~SP-44005). {Big Band Percussion} (~SP-44002) 
seemed one of the least attractive discs- the arrangements just 
didn't have so much character as the others.   There is an extraordinary 
sense of presence in all of these recordings, apparently obtained 
at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies. 
The penalty for this is noticeable in the big, bold, brilliant, 
but brassy piano sounds in {Melody and Percussion for Two Pianos} 
(~SP-44007). All of the releases, however, are recorded at a 
gratifyingly high level, with resultant masking of any surface noise. 
{Pass in Review} practically guarantees enjoyment, and is a dramatic 
demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system.

Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic, but not 
realistic.   Strange, but true- authenticity and realism often 
aren't related at all.   Almost every film bearing the imprimatur 
of Hollywood is physically authentic- in fact, impeccably so. In 
any given period piece the costumes, bric-a-brac, vehicles, and decor, 
bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity.   The major studios 
maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who 
look to this matter. During the making recently of an important Biblical 
film, some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only 
of costumes and interiors, but of architectural developments, sports 
arenas, vehicles, and other paraphernalia were compiled, consulted, and 
complied with.   But, alas, the authenticity seems to stop at 
the set's edge. The drama itself- and this seems to be lavishly true 
of Biblical drama- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity 
at all. The storyline, in sort, is wildly unrealistic. 
Thus, in "The Story of Ruth" we have Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz 
and sets that are meticulously authentic. But except for a vague adherence 
to the basic storyline- i&e&, that Ruth remained with Naomi 
and finally wound up with Boaz- the film version has little to 
do with the Bible.   And in the new "King of Kings" the 
plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to 
the Gospels.   Earlier this month Edward R& Murrow, director 
of the United States Information Agency, came to Hollywood and 
had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry.

He talked about unauthentic storylines too. He intimated that 
they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War. And 
to an industry that prides itself on authenticity, he urged greater realism.

"in many corners of the globe", he said, "the major 
source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet. 
Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga 
of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge? Yet for 
much of the globe, Hollywood is just that- prime, if not sole, source 
of knowledge. If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge 
our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone, what conclusions 
do you think he might come to?

Francois D'Albert, Hungarian-born violinist who made his 
New York debut three years ago, played a return engagement last night 
in Judson Hall. He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory 
College. His pianist was Donald Jenni, a faculty member at DePaul 
University.   The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged 
by the artists, so that for the first half of the program, when 
the 
piano was partially open, Mr& Jenni's playing was too loud. In 
vying with him, Mr& D'Albert also seemed to be overdriving his 
tone.   This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the 
performances, however, except in the case of the opening work, Mozart's 
Sonata in ~A (K& 526), which clattered along noisily in 
an unrelieved fashion.   Brahm's Sonata in ~A, although also 
vigorous, stood up well under the two artists' strong, large-scale 
treatment. Mr& D'Albert has a firm, attractive tone, which eschews 
an overly sweet vibrato. He made the most of the long Brahmsian 
phrases, and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work 
a handsome performance.   A Sonata for Violin and Piano, called 
"Bella Bella", by Robert Fleming, was given its first United 
States performance. The title refers to the nickname given his 
wife by the composer, who is also a member of the National Film Board 
of Canada. The work's two movements, one melodically sentimental, 
the other brightly capricious, are clever enough in a Ravel-like 
style, but they rehash a wornout idiom. They might well indicate conjugal 
felicity, but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood.   Works 
by Dohnanyi, Hubay, Mr& D'Albert himself and Paganini, 
indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve 
as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase. Standard items 
by Sarasate and Saint-Saens completed the program. @

IN recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York 
Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium, but her program last night 
at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist's first New York recital 
since 1948.   Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard, 
and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the 
authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control. And the 
tone she commands is always beautiful in sound.   Since she also 
has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the 
romantic tradition, Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure. 
She played with style and a touch of the grand manner, and every 
piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures.

The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers 
of this century. It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best. 
The Rachmaninoff Prelude No& 12, Op& 32, for instance, gave 
her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities- the 
ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them 
simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.   The 
four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured, rich in color and songful. 
And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism 
and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs.   Miss 
Xydis' 
earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses, in which 
each variation was nicely set off from the others; Haydn's Sonata 
in ~E minor, which was unfailingly pleasant in sound, and Chopin's 
Sonata in ~B flat minor. A memory lapse in the last somewhat 
marred the pianist's performance. So what was the deepest music 
on her program had the poorest showing. Miss Xydis was best when 
she did not need to be too probing.

ALL the generals who held important commands in World War 
/2, did not write books. It only seems as if they did. And the 
best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written. One 
of the very best is only now published in this country, five years 
after its first publication in England. It is "Defeat Into Victory", 
by Field Marshal Viscount Slim.   A long book heavily 
weighted with military technicalities, in this edition it is neither 
so long nor so technical as it was originally. Field Marshal Slim 
has abridged it for the benefit of "those who, finding not so great 
an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves, are more 
interested in men and their reactions to stress, hardship and danger". 
The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is, of 
course, the Field Marshal himself.   William Joseph Slim, 
First Viscount Slim, former Governor General of Australia, was the 
principal British commander in the field during the Burma War. He 
had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat 
of 1942 when the ill-prepared, ill-equipped British forces "were outmaneuvered, 
outfought and outgeneraled". He returned in command of 
an international army of Gurkhas, Indians, Africans, Chinese and 
British. And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles 
and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most 
brilliant campaigns of the war. "The Forgotten War" his soldiers 
called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe 
enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines.   Parts of "Defeat 
Into Victory" are a tangle of Burmese place names and military 
units, but a little application makes everything clear enough. On 
the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book. 
Field Marshal Slim is striking in description, amusing in many anecdotes. 
He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit 
mistakes and even "a cardinal error". He praises many individuals 
generously. He himself seems to be tough, tireless, able and intelligent, 
more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers. 

#REMAKING 
AN ARMY TO WIN#

"Defeat Into Victory" is a dramatic 
and lively military narrative. But it is most interesting in its account 
of the unending problems of high command, of decisions and their 
reasons, of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle 
action.   Before he could return to Burma, Field Marshal 
Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite 
them with fresh recruits. His remarks about training, discipline, 
morale, leadership and command are enlightening. He believed in making 
inspiring speeches and he made a great many. He believed in being 
seen near the front lines and he was there. For general morale reasons 
and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers, when food was 
short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly.

Other crucial matters required constant supervision: 
labor and all noncombatant troops, whose morale was vital, too; 
administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with 
Top Brass- British, American and Chinese; health, hygiene, medical 
aid and preventive medicine; hospitals (inadequate) and nurses 
(scanty); food and military supplies; logistics and transport; 
airdrops and airstrips; roads and river barges to be built. 

#EXPECTED 
OF A COMMANDER#

Commenting on these and other matters, Field 
Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks:   "When 
in doubt as to two courses of action, a general should choose the 
bolder".   "The commander has failed in <his> duty if he 
has not won victory- for that <is> his duty".   "It only 
does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which 
others may have but which you cannot give them. It depresses them. So 
I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some 
of it".   Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage 
of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders. 
Of the Japanese private he says: "He fought and marched till
