of danger spots in his relationship to people- can be considerably 
beefed up by the linguist. His esoteric chartings of the voice alert 
the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying 
psychological difficulties, making them apparent first to the 
therapist and eventually to the patient. In one now-historic first 
interview, 
for example, the transcript (reproduced from the book, <The 
First Five Minutes>) goes like this: **f The therapist's level 
tone is bland and neutral- he has, for example, avoided stressing 
"you", which would imply disapproval; or surprise, which would 
set the patient apart from other people. The patient, on the other 
hand, is far from neutral; aside from her specifically regional accent, 
she reveals by the use of the triad, "irritable, tense, depressed", 
a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity 
with literary or scientific language (i&e&, she must have 
had at least a high-school education), and she is telling a story she 
has mentally rehearsed some time before. Then she catapults into "everything 
and everybody", putting particular violence on "everybody", 
indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag- that 
is, it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up 
to this point. Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention. 
He may then very well conclude that "everybody" is probably 
not the true target of her resentment. Immediately thereafter, the 
patient fractures her rehearsed story, veering into an oversoft, breathy, 
sloppily articulated, "I don't feel like talking right now".

Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent 
to the therapist that "everybody" truthfully refers to the woman's 
husband. She says later, but still within the opening five minutes, 
"I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death".

The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are 
all present in the voice chart for this sentence; so are certain 
signals that she does not accept divorce. By saying "a<noth>er emotional 
death", she reveals that there has been a previous one, although 
she has not described it in words. This the therapist may pursue 
in 
later questioning. The phrase, "emotional death", interesting and, 
to a non-scientific mind, rather touching, suggests that this woman 
may have some flair for words, perhaps even something of the temperament 
regrettably called "creative".   Since the psychiatric interview, 
like any other interview, depends on communication, it is significant 
to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked 
skill and long experience. His own communication apparatus operated 
superbly, and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total 
lack of resemblance to the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of 
Dr& Blauberman. Interestingly enough- although none of the real-life 
therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman- 
when groups of them began playing back interviews, they discovered 
any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview 
techniques; almost everyone, on first hearing one of his own sessions 
on tape, expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.

Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped interviews 
by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact 
that, in the first five minutes of an initial interview, the patient 
often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him; 
to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively 
or scientifically how to listen. Naturally, the patient does not say, 
"I hate my father", or "Sibling rivalry is what bugs me". 
What he <does> do 
is give himself away by communicating information over 
and above the words involved. Some of the classic indicators, as described 
by Drs& Pittenger, Hockett, and Danehy in <The First 
Five Minutes>, are these: _AMBIGUITY OF PRONOUNS:_ Stammering 
or repetition of <I, you, he, she>, et cetera may signal 
ambiguity 
or uncertainty. On the other hand significant facts may be concealed- 
<she> may mean <I>; or <everybody>, as it did with the tense 
and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to a specific person. 
The word that is <not> used can be as important as the word that 
<is> used; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives. 
When someone says, for example, "They took ~X rays to 
see that there was nothing wrong with me", it pays to consider how 
this statement would normally be made. (This patient, in actuality, 
was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the 
fact 
that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.) 
**h Amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in Durrell's 
Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke of his wife, which 
is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.

@ She was just another freighter from the States, and she seemed 
as commonplace as her name. She was the <John Harvey,> one 
of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans, 
bombs, and bullets to the U&S& Fifteenth Air Force, to Field 
Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the 
boot of Italy in that early December of 1943.   The <John Harvey> 
arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic, on November 28th, 
making for Porto Nuovo, which, as the name indicates, was the ancient 
city's new and modern harbor. Hardly anyone ashore marked her as 
she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole. If anyone thought 
of the <John Harvey,> it was to observe that she was straddled by 
a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit 
the <John Harvey> would likely be blown up with her own ammo and 
whatever else it was that she carried.   Which was poison gas. 
##

It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
before the <John Harvey> could be loaded with 100 tons of 
mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront. For in a world 
as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas 
was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.   Throughout 
the early years of World War /2,, reports persisted that the 
Axis powers had used gas- Germany in Russia, Japan in China again. 
They were always denied. Influential people in America were warning 
the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by 
the Germans in future campaigns. Some extremists went so far as to 
urge our using it first. To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President 
Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August:

"From time to time since the present war began there have 
been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating 
use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices 
of warfare. I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our 
present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such 
terrible and inhumane weapons.   "However, evidence that the 
Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an 
intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety 
of sources.   "Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the 
general opinion of civilized mankind. This country has not used them, 
and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them. I state categorically 
that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such 
weapons unless they are first used by our enemies".   The 
following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave 
effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in 
southern Italy. Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming 
safety, but because of its proximity to airfields. Any retaliatory 
gas attack would be airborne. It would be made in three waves- the 
first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the 
third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.

So the vile cargo went into the hole of the <John Harvey>. A 
detachment 
of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under 
First Lt& Howard D& Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt& 
Thomas H& Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer. Secrecy 
was paramount. Only a few other people- very important people- knew 
of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks. No one else must 
know. Thus, in the immemorial way- in the way of the right hand that 
knows and the left that does not- was the stage set for tragedy 
at Bari.   It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was growing 
dark in Bari. It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German 
~Me-210 
plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit. Capt& 
A& B& Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very 
worried. He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning 
to the attack in Italy. On November 24th, they had made a raid on La 
Maddalena. Two days later, some 30 of them had struck at a convoy 
off Bougie, sinking a troopship- and it had been that very night that 
the ~Me-210 had made its first appearance. After it had reappeared 
the next two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said:

"For three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been 
over the city taking pictures. They're just waiting for the proper 
time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic".

But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist. 
Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now 
being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander 
who would conduct the "Little Blitz" on London in 1944, a 
major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered 
seriously. True, there had been raids on Naples- but Naples was 
pretty far north on the opposite coast. No, Bari was out of range. 
More than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth 
Army's sector. So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch 
the scouting plane put in five more appearances, and to feel the 
certainty of this dread rising within him. For Jenks knew that Bari's 
defenses were made of paper. The Royal Air Force had but a single 
light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available. There 
were no R&A&F& fighter squadrons on Bari airfield. The 
radar station with the best location was still not serviceable. Telephone 
communication was bad. And everywhere in evidence among the few 
remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster- multiple 
command.   It had been made shockingly evident that very morning 
to Ensign Kay K& Vesole, in charge of the armed guard aboard the 
<John Bascom>. A British officer had come aboard and told him 
that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs 
were actually dropped. Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a 
radar-controlled 
shore gun firing white tracers.   "This harbor is 
a bomber's paradise", the Britisher had said with frank grimness. 
"It's up to you to protect yourselves. We can't expect any 
help from the fighters at Foggia, either. They're all being used on 
offensive missions".   Vesole had been stunned. Not fire until 
the bombs came down! He thought of the tons and tons of flammable 
fluid beneath his feet and shook his head. Like hell! Like hell 
he'd wait- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out? 
What would his guns guide on then- the North Star? Ensign 
Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering 
of the bombs, and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/~c Donald 
L& Norton and Seaman 1/~c William A& Rochford on the guns 
and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette. 
Below decks, Seaman 1/~c Stanley Bishop had begun to write 
a letter home. ##

Above decks on the <John Harvey,> Lieutenant 
Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and 
felt uneasy. There were lights glinting in the city, too, even though 
it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible. Bari was
