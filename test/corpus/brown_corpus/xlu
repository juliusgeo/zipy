there may be multiplication in some food or beverage products, i&e&, 
in milk for example. The secondary consequences from this could 
be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for 
defense.   Something of the behavior of clouds of small particles 
can be illustrated by the following field trials:   In the 
first trial an inert substance was disseminated from a boat travelling 
some ten miles off shore under appropriately selected meteorological 
conditions. Zinc cadmium sulfide in particles of 2 microns in size were 
disseminated. This material fluoresces under ultraviolet light which 
facilitates its sampling and assessment. Four hundred and fifty pounds 
was disseminated while the ship was traveling a distance of 156 
miles.   Figure 1 describes the results obtained in this trial. 
The particles traveled a maximum detected distance of some 450 miles. 
From these dosage isopleths it can be seen that an area of over 34,000 
square miles was covered. These dosages could have been increased 
by increasing the source strength which was small in this case. 
The behavior of a biological aerosol, on a much smaller scale, is illustrated 
by a specific field trial conducted with a non-pathogenic organism. 
An aqueous suspension of the spores of <B& subtilis, var& 
niger>, generally known as <Bacillus globigii>, was aerosolized 
using commercially available nozzles. A satisfactory cloud was produced 
even though these nozzles were only about 5 per cent efficient in 
producing an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 microns. In this 
test, 130 gallons of a suspension, having a count of **f organisms 
per ~ml, or a total of approximately **f spores, was aerosolized. The 
spraying operation was conducted from the rear deck of a small Naval 
vessel, cruising two miles off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze. 
Spraying continued along a two-mile course.   This operation 
was started at 5:00 p&m& and lasted for 29 minutes. There was 
a slight lapse condition, a moderate fog, and 100 per cent relative 
humidity. A network of sampling stations had been set up on shore. These 
were located at the homes of Government employees, in Government 
Offices, buildings and reservations within the trial area. A rough 
attempt was made to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by 
taking samples from outside the windows on the first, ninth, and fifteenth 
floors of a Government office building.   All samplers were 
operated for a period of two hours except one, which was operated 
for four hours. In this instance, there was a dosage of 562 during the 
first two hours and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period, 
a four-fold increase. This suggests that the sampling period, particularly 
at the more distant locations, should have been increased.

As can be seen from Figure 2, an extensive area was covered by this 
aerosol. The maximum distance sampled was 23 miles from the source. 
As can be seen from these dosage isopleths, approximately 100 square 
miles was covered within the area sampled. It is quite likely that 
an even greater area was covered, particularly downwind. The dosages 
in the three levels of the vertical profile were: **f   This was 
not, of course, enough sampling to give a satisfactory description 
of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol.   A number of unique medical 
problems might be created when man is exposed to an infectious 
agent through the respiratory route rather than by the natural portal 
of entry. 
Some agents have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious 
to experimental animals when exposed to aerosols of optimum particle 
size than by the natural portal. Botulinal toxin, for example, is several 
thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when given per os. 
In some instances a different clinical disease picture may result from 
this route of exposure, making diagnosis difficult. In tularemia produced 
by aerosol exposure, one would not expect to find the classical 
ulcer of "rabbit fever" on a finger.   An enemy would obviously 
choose an agent that is believed to be highly infectious. Agents 
that are known to cause frequent infections among laboratory workers 
such as those causing ~Q fever, tularemia, brucellosis, glanders, 
coccidioidomycosis, etc&, belong in this category.   An agent 
would 
likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability and virulence 
stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements. It 
is, obviously, a proper goal of research to improve on this property. 
In this connection it should be capable of being disseminated without 
excessive destruction. Moreover, it should not be so fastidious in 
its growth requirements as to make production on a militarily significant 
scale improbable.   An aggressor would use an agent against 
which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced 
immunity in a target population. A solid immunity is the one effective 
circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralized. 
It must be remembered, however, that there are many agents for which 
there is no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be 
broken by an appropriate dose of agent.   There is a broad spectrum 
of organisms from which selection for a specified military purpose 
might be made. An enemy might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism, 
a chronic disease producer or one causing a high rate of lethality.

It is possible that certain mutational forms may be produced 
such as antibiotic resistant strains. Mutants may also be developed 
with changes in biochemical properties that are of importance in 
identification. All of these considerations are of critical importance 
in considering defense and medical management.   Biological agents 
are, of course, highly host-specific. They do not destroy physical 
structures as is true of high explosives. This may be of overriding 
importance in considering military objectives.   The question 
of epidemic disease merits some discussion. Only a limited effort has 
been devoted to this problem. Some of those who question the value 
of ~BW have assumed that the <only> potential would be in the establishment 
of epidemics. They then point out that with our present lack 
of knowledge of all the factors concerned in the rise and fall 
of epidemics, it is unlikely that a planned episode could be initiated. 
They argue further (and somewhat contradictorily) that our knowledge 
and resources in preventive medicine would make it possible to control 
such an outbreak of disease. this is why this approach to ~BW 
defense has not been given major attention.   Our major problem 
is what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target. This, 
of course, does not eliminate from consideration for this purpose 
agents that are associated naturally with epidemic disease. A hypothetical 
example will illustrate this point. Let us assume that it would 
be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent 
of epidemic typhus (<Rickettsia prowazwki>) over City ~A and 
that a large number of cases of typhus fever resulted therefrom. No epidemic 
was initiated nor was one expected because the population in City 
~A was not lousy. Lousiness is a prerequisite for epidemic typhus. 
In this case, then, the military objective was accomplished with 
an epidemic agent solely through the results secured in the initial 
attack. This was done with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic. 
On the other hand, a similar attack might have been made on City 
~B whose population was known to be lousy. One might expect some 
spread of the disease in this case resulting in increased effectiveness 
of the attack.   The major defensive problems are concerned 
with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agents from 
appropriate disseminating devices. It should be no more difficult 
to deliver such devices than other weapons. The same delivery vehicles- 
whether they be airplanes, submarines or guided missiles- should 
be usable. If it is possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on 
a city, it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent 
over that city.   Biological agents are, moreover, suitable 
for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense. 
A few obvious target areas of great importance might be mentioned. 
The air conditioning and ventilating systems of large buildings are 
subject to attack. America is rapidly becoming a nation that uses 
processed, precooked and even predigested foods. This is an enormous 
industry that is subject to sabotage. One must include the preparation 
of soft drinks and the processing of milk and milk products. Huge 
industries are involved also in the production of biological products, 
drugs and cosmetics which are liable to this type of attack.

A variety of techniques have been directed toward the isolation 
and study of blood group antibodies. These include low-temperature 
ethanol (Cohn) fractionation, electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and 
column chromatography on ion exchange celluloses. Modifications of 
the last technique have been applied by several groups of investigators. 
Abelson and Rawson, using a stepwise elution scheme, fractionated 
whole sera containing ~ABO and ~Rh antibodies on diethylaminoethyl 
~DEAE cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. Speer 
and coworkers, in a similar study of blood group antibodies of whole 
sera, used a series of gradients for elution from ~DEAE-cellulose. 
Fahey and Morrison used a single, continuous gradient at constant 
~pH for the fractionation of anti-~A and anti-~B agglutinins 
from preisolated ~|g-globulin samples.   In the 
present work whole sera have been fractionated by chromatography on 
~DEAE-cellulose 
using single gradients similar to those described 
by Sober and Peterson, and certain chemical and serological properties 
of the fractions containing antibodies of the ~ABO and ~Rh 
systems have been described. 

#MATERIALS AND METHODS#

_SAMPLES._ 
Serum samples were obtained from normal group ~A, group ~B 
and group ~O donors. Three of the anti-~Rh sera used were taken 
from recently sensitized individuals. One contained complete antibody 
and had a titer of 1:512 in saline. The second contained incomplete 
antibody and showed titers of 1:256 in albumin and 1:2048 by 
the indirect Coombs test. The third, containing the mixed type of complete 
and incomplete antibodies, had titers of 1:256 in saline, 1:512 
in albumin and 1:1024 by the indirect Coombs test. In addition 
one serum was obtained from a donor (R& E&) who had been sensitized 
6 years previously. This serum exhibited titers of 1:16 in albumin 
and 1:256 by the indirect Coombs test. These antibody titers 
were determined by reaction with homozygous **f red cells. _SEROLOGICAL 
TECHNIQUE._ Anti-~A and anti-~B activities were determined 
in fractions from the sera of group ~A, group ~B or group ~O 
donors by the following tube agglutination methods. One drop of each 
sample was added to one drop of a 2% suspension of group **f or 
group ~B red cells in a small **f test tube. In several instances 
group ~O cells were also used as controls. The red cells were used 
within 2 days after donation and were washed with large amounts of saline 
before use. The mixtures of sample plus cell suspension were allowed 
to stand at room temperature for 1 ~hr. the tubes were then 
centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min and examined macroscopically for 
agglutination. For the albumin method, equal volumes of 30% bovine 
albumin, sample and 2% cells suspended in saline were allowed to 
stand at room temperature for 1 ~hr and then were centrifuged at 1000 
~rpm for 1 ~min. All samples were tested by both the saline and 
albumin methods. The activities of fractions of sera containing ~Rh 
antibodies were tested by the saline, albumin and indirect Coombs 
techniques. Homozygous and heterozygous **f cells, **f and homozygous 
and heterozygous **f cells were used to test each sample; however, 
in the 
interest of clarity and conciseness only the results obtained with 
homozygous **f and homozygous **f cells will be presented here. 
The saline and albumin tests were performed as described for the ~ABO 
samples except that the mixture was incubated for 1 ~hr at 37`~C 
before centrifugation. The saline tubes were saved and used 
for 
the indirect Coombs test in the following manner. The cells were washed 
three times with saline, anti-human serum was added, the cells were 
resuspended, and the mixture was centrifuged at 1000 ~rpm for 1 ~min 
and examined for agglutination. The anti-human sera used were prepared 
by injecting whole human serum into rabbits. Those antisera shown 
by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the "broad spectrum" type were
