Moon, which is again in contrast to the infrared emission, which reaches 
its maximum at Full Moon. Piddington and Minnett explained 
their observations by pointing out that rocklike materials which are likely 
to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent 
to radio waves, although opaque to infrared radiation. The infrared 
emission could then be assumed to originate at the surface of the moon, 
while the radio emission originates at some depth beneath the surface, 
where the temperature variation due to solar radiation is reduced 
in amplitude and shifted in phase. Since the absorption of radio waves 
in rocklike material varies with wave length, it should be possible 
to sample the temperature variation at different depths beneath the surface 
and possibly detect changes in the structure or composition of the 
lunar surface material.   The radio emission of a planet was 
first detected in 1955, when Burke and Franklin (1955) identified the 
origin of interference-like radio noise on their records at about 15 
meters wave length as emission from Jupiter. This sporadic type of 
planetary radiation is discussed by Burke (chap& 13) and Gallet (chap& 
14). Steady radiation which was presumably of thermal origin was 
observed from Venus at 3.15 and 9.4 ~cm, and from Mars and Jupiter 
at 3.15 ~cm in 1956 (Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958<a, 
b, c>), and from Saturn at 3.75 ~cm in 1957 (Drake and Ewen, 
1958). In the relatively short time since these early observations, 
Venus has been observed at additional wave lengths in the range from 
0.8 to 10.2 ~cm, and Jupiter has been observed over the wave-length 
range from 3.03 to 68 ~cm.   The observable characteristics of 
planetary radio radiation are the intensity, the polarization, and the 
direction of arrival of the waves. The maximum angular diameter of 
any planetary disk as observed from the earth is about 1 minute of arc. 
This is much smaller than the highest resolution of even the very 
large reflectors now under construction, and consequently the radio emission 
of different regions of the disk cannot be resolved. It should 
be possible, however, to put useful limits on the diameters of the radio 
sources by observing with large reflectors or with interferometers. 
Measurements of polarization are presently limited by apparatus sensitivity 
and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the 
planetary radiation at the earth. There have been few measurements specifically 
for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation. 
The measurements made with the ~NRL 50-foot reflector, 
which is altitude-azimuth-mounted, would have shown a systematic change 
with local hour angle in the measured intensities of Venus and Jupiter 
if a substantial part of the radiation had been linearly polarized. 
Recent interferometer measurements (Radhakrishnan and Roberts, 
1960) have shown the 960-~Mc emission of Jupiter to be partially 
polarized 
and to originate in a region of larger diameter than the visible 
disk. Other than this very significant result, most of the information 
now available about the radio emission of the planets is restricted 
to the intensity of the radiation.   The concept of apparent 
black-body temperature is used to describe the radiation received from 
the moon and the planets. The received radiation is compared with the 
radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtends the same solid 
angle as the visible disk of the planet. The <apparent black-body 
disk temperature> is the temperature which must be assumed for the 
black body in order that the intensity of its radiation should equal that 
of the observed radiation. The use of this concept does not specify 
the origin of the radiation, and only if the planet really radiates 
as a black body, will the apparent black-body temperature correspond 
to the physical temperature of the emitting material.   The radio 
radiation of the sun which is reflected from the moon and planets should 
be negligible compared with their thermal emission at centimeter 
wave lengths, except possibly at times of exceptional outbursts of solar 
radio noise. The quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation 
would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less 
than 1` ~K. At meter wave lengths and increase of the order of 
10` ~K in the average disk temperatures of the nearer planets would 
be expected. Therefore, neglecting the extreme outbursts, reflected 
solar radiation is not expected to cause sizable errors in the measurements 
of planetary radiation in the centimeter- and decimeter-wave-length 
range. 

#2. THE MOON#

_2.1 OBSERVATIONS_ Radio observations 
of the moon have been made over the range of wave lengths from 4.3 ~mm 
to 75 ~cm, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Observations 
have also been made at 1.5 ~mm using optical techniques (Sinton, 
1955, 1956,; see also chap& 11). Not all the observers have used 
the same procedures or made the same assumptions about the lunar brightness 
distribution when reducing the data, and this, together with 
differences in the methods of calibrating the antennae and receivers, 
must account for much of the disagreement in the measured radio brightness 
temperatures.   In the observations at 4.3 ~mm (Coates, 
1959<a>), the diameter of the antenna beam, 6'.7, was small enough 
to allow resolution of some of the larger features of the lunar surface, 
and contour diagrams have been made of the lunar brightness distribution 
at three lunar phases. These observations indicate that the lunar 
maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do 
the mountainous regions. Mare Imbrium seems to be an exception and 
remains cooler than the regions which surround it. These contour diagrams 
also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with 
latitude.   Very recently, observations have been made at 8-~mm 
wave length with a reflector 22 meters in diameter with a resultant 
beam width of only about 2' (Amenitskii, Noskova, and Salomonovich, 
1960). The constant-temperature contours are much smoother than those 
observed at 4.3 ~mm by Coates (1959<a>), and apparently the emission 
at 8 ~mm is not nearly so sensitive to differences in surface 
features. Such high-resolution observations as these are needed at several 
wave lengths in order that the radio emission of the moon can 
be properly 
interpreted.   The observations of Mayer, McCullough, 
and Sloanaker at 3.15 ~cm and of Sloanaker at 10.3 ~cm have not 
previously 
been published and will be briefly described. Measurements 
at 3.15 ~cm were obtained on 11 days spread over the interval May 3 
to June 19, 1956, using the 50-foot reflector at the U& S& Naval 
Research Laboratory in Washington. The half-intensity diameter 
of the antenna beam was about 9', and the angle subtended by the moon 
included the entire main beam and part of the first side lobes. The 
antenna patterns and the power gain at the peak of the beam were both 
measured (Mayer, McCullough, and Sloanaker, 1958<b>), so that 
the 
absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle 
of the moon was known. The ratio of the measured antenna temperature 
change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature 
of the moon over the antenna beam (assuming that the brightness 
temperature of the sky is negligible) was found, by graphical integration 
of the antenna directivity diagram, to be 0.85. The measured 
brightness temperature is a good approximation to the brightness temperature 
at the <center of the lunar disk> because of the narrow antenna 
beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion 
of the moon's disk is nearly uniform. The result of the observations 
is (in ` ~K) **f where the phase angle, |q<t>, is measured 
in degrees from new moon and the probable errors include absolute 
as well as relative errors. This result is plotted along with the 8.6-~mm 
observations of Gibson (1958) in figure 1, <a>. The variation 
in the 3-~cm emission of the moon during a lunation is very much 
less than the variation in the 8.6-~mm emission, as would be expected 
from the explanation of Piddington and Minnett (1949). In the discussion 
which follows, the time average of the radio emission will be 
referred to as the <constant component>, and the superimposed periodic 
variation will be called the <variable component>.   The 10.3-~cm 
observation of Sloanaker was made on May 20, 1958, using the 
84-foot reflector at the Maryland Point Observatory of the U& 
S& Naval Research Laboratory. The age of the moon was about 2 
days. The half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna was 
about 18'.5, and the brightness temperature was reduced by assuming 
a Gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for 
the moon. 

#ABSTRACT#

Experiments were made on an electric arc applying a porous 
graphite anode cooled by a transpiring gas (Argon). Thus, the 
energy transferred from the arc to the anode was partly fed back into 
the arc. It was shown that by proper anode design the net energy loss 
of the arc to the anode could be reduced to approximately 15% of the 
total arc energy A detailed energy balance of the anode was established. 
The anode ablation could be reduced to a negligible amount. The dependence 
of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating 
gas was investigated for various arc lengths and currents between 
100 ~Amp and 200 ~Amp. Qualitative observations were made and 
high-speed motion pictures were taken to study flow phenomena in the 
arc at various mass flow velocities. 

#INTRODUCTION#

The high heat 
fluxes existing at the electrode surfaces of electric arcs necessitate 
extensive cooling to prevent electrode ablation. The cooling requirements 
are particularly severe at the anode. In free burning electric 
arcs, for instance, approximately 90% of the total arc power is transferred 
to the anode giving rise to local heat fluxes in excess of 
**f as measured by the authors- the exact value depending on the arc 
atmosphere. In plasma generators as currently commercially available 
for industrial use or as high temperature research tools often more than 
50% of the total energy input is being transferred to the co0ling 
medium of the anode.   The higher heat transfer rates at the anode 
compared with those at the cathode can be explained by the physical 
phenomena occurring in free burning arcs. In plasma generators the 
superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat. The heat 
transfer to the anode is due to the following effects: 1. Heat 
of condensation (work function) plus kinetic energy of the electrons impinging 
on the anode. This energy transfer depends on the current, the 
temperature in the arc column, the anode material, and the conditions 
in the anode sheath. 2. Heat transfer by molecular conduction as well 
as by radiation from the arc column.   The heat transfer to 
the anode in free burning arcs is enhanced by a hot gas jet flowing from 
the cathode towards the anode with velocities up **f. This phenomenon 
has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker (Ref& 
1). The pressure gradient producing the jet is due to the nature of the 
magnetic field in the arc (rapid decrease of current density from cathode 
to the anode). Hence, the flow conditions at the anode of free 
burning arcs resemble those near a stagnation point.   it is apparent 
from the above and from experimental evidence that the cooling requirements 
for the anode of free burning arcs are large compared with 
those for the cathode. The gas flow through a plasma generator will modify 
these conditions; however, the anode is still the part receiving 
the largest heat flux. An attempt to improve the life of the anodes 
or the efficiency of the plasma generators must, therefore, aim at 
a reduction of the anode loss. The following possibilities exist for 
achieving this: 1. The use of high voltages and low currents by proper 
design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a given 
power output. 2. Continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode 
by flow or magnetic forces. 3. Feed back of the energy transferred 
to the anode by applying gas transpiration through the anode. 
The third method was, to our knowledge, successfully applied for the 
first time by C& Sheer and co-workers (Ref& 2). The purpose of 
the present study is to study the thermal conditions and to establish 
an energy balance for a transpiration cooled anode as well as the effect 
of blowing on the arc voltage. Gas injection through a porous anode
