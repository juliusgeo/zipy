being caused by the trial and sentence of John Brown, Rhode Islanders 
turned their attention to the state elections. The state had 
elected Republican candidates in the past two years. There was no doubt 
as to the control the Republican party exercised throughout the 
state. If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates for general state 
offices by majorities, the failure was due to a lingering remnant 
of the Know-Nothing party, which called itself the American Republican 
party. The American Republicans and the Republicans both nominated 
Lieutenant-Governor Turner for governor. Elisha R& Potter 
was the Democratic candidate. The results of the election of 1859 
found Republican candidates not only winning the offices of governor 
and lieutenant-governor but also obtaining the two Congressional offices 
from the eastern and western sections of the state.   During 
the month of November hardly a day passed when there was not some mention 
of John Brown in the Rhode Island newspapers. On November 
7, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> reprinted a letter sent 
to John Brown from "E& B&", a Quaker lady in Newport. In 
reference to Brown's raid she wrote, "though we are non-resistants 
and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal 
weapons **h we know thee was anemated [<sic>] by the most generous 
and philanthropic motives". "E& B&" compared John Brown 
to Moses in that they were both acting to deliver millions from 
oppression. In contrast to "E& B&", most Rhode Islanders 
hardly thought of John Brown as being another Moses. Most attempts 
to develop any sympathy for Brown and his actions found an unresponsive 
audience in Rhode Island.   On Wednesday evening, November 
23, 1859, in Warren, Rev& Mark Trafton of New Bedford, gave 
a "Mission of Sympathy" lecture in which he favorably viewed the 
Harper's Ferry insurrection. The Warren <Telegraph> stated 
that many of Rev& Trafton's remarks were inappropriate and savored 
strongly of radicalism and fanaticism. In its account of the Trafton 
lecture, the Providence <Daily Post> said that the remarks 
of 
Rev& Trafton made the people indignant.   No sympathy or admiration 
for Brown could be found in the Providence <Daily Post>, 
for the editor claimed that there were a score of men in the state prison 
who were a thousand times more deserving of sympathy. The Providence 
<Daily Journal>, however, stated that Brown's courage, bravery, 
and heroism "in a good cause would make a man a martyr; it gives 
something of dignity even to a bad one". The Woonsocket <Patriot> 
admitted that John Brown might deserve punishment or imprisonment 
"but he should no more be hung than Henry A& Wise or James 
Buchanan". The Newport <Mercury> exhibited more concern over 
the possibility of the abolitionists making a martyr of Brown than it 
did over the development of sympathy for him.   In her letter 
to John Brown, "E& B&", the Quakeress from Newport, had 
suggested that the American people owed more honor to John Brown for 
seeking to free the slaves than they did to George Washington. During 
the latter days of November to the day of Brown's execution, 
it seems that most Rhode Islanders did not concur in "E& B&'s" 
suggestion. On November 22, 1859, the Providence <Daily Journal> 
stated that although Brown's "pluck" and honest fanaticism 
must be admired, any honor paid to Brown would only induce other fanatics 
to imitate his actions. A week later the <Daily Journal> 
had 
discovered the initial plans of some Providence citizens to hold a 
meeting honoring John Brown on the day of his execution. The editor 
of the <Daily Journal> warned, "**h that if such a demonstration 
be made, it will not find support or countenance from any of the men 
whose names are recognized as having a right to speak for Providence". 
The Providence <Daily Post>'s editor wrote that he could 
not 
believe that a meeting honoring Brown was to be held in Providence. 
He further called upon the people of Providence to rebuke the meeting 
and avoid disgrace.   On December 2, 1859, John Brown was 
hanged at Charles Town, Virginia. Extraordinary precautions were 
taken so that no stranger be allowed in the city and no citizen within 
the enclosure surrounding the scaffold. In many Northern towns and 
cities meetings were held and church bells were tolled. Such was not 
the case in Rhode Island. The <only> public demonstration in honor 
of John Brown was held at Pratt's Hall in Providence, on the 
day of his execution.   Despite the opposition of the city newspapers, 
the Pratt Hall meeting "brought together a very respectable 
audience, composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years 
for their radical views upon the subject of slavery, of many of our 
colored citizens, and of those who were attracted to the place by the 
novelty of such a gathering". Seated on the platform were Amos C& 
Barstow, ex-mayor of Providence and a wealthy Republican stove 
manufacturer; Thomas Davis, an uncompromising Garrisonian; the 
Reverend Augustus Woodbury, a Unitarian minister; the Reverend 
George T& Day, a Free-Will Baptist; Daniel w& Vaughan, 
and William H& H& Clements. The latter two were appointed secretaries. 
The first speaker was Amos C& Barstow who had been unanimously 
chosen president of the meeting. He spoke of his desire to promote 
the abolition of slavery by peaceable means and he compared John 
Brown of Harper's Ferry to the John Brown of Rhode Island's 
colonial period. Barstow concluded that as Rhode Island's John 
Brown became a canonized hero, if not a saint, so would it be with 
John Brown of Harper's Ferry.   The next speaker was George 
T& Day. Although admitting Brown's guilt on legal grounds, 
Day said that, "Brown is no common criminal; his deed was not 
below, but above the law". 
Following Day was Woodbury who spoke of his 
disapproval of Brown's attempt at servile insurrection, his admiration 
of Brown's character, and his opposition to slavery. Woodbury's 
remarks were applauded by a portion of the audience several times 
and once there was hissing.   The fourth and last speaker was Thomas 
Davis. By this time large numbers of the audience had left the 
hall. Davis commenced his remarks by an allusion to the general feeling 
of opposition which the meeting had encountered from many of the 
citizens and all the newspapers of the city. He said that the propriety 
or impropriety of such a gathering was a question that was to be settled 
by every man in accordance with the convictions of private judgments. 
In the remainder of his speech Davis spoke of his admiration for 
Brown and warned those who took part in the meeting that they "are 
liable to the charge that they are supporting traitors and upholding 
men whom the laws have condemned". He recalled that in Rhode Island 
a party opposed to the state's condemnation of a man (Thomas W& 
Dorr) proclaimed the state's action as a violation of the law 
of the land and the principles of human liberty. At the close of Davis' 
speech the following preamble and resolutions were read by the president, 
and on the question of their adoption passed unanimously:

Whereas, John Brown has cheerfully risked his life in endeavoring 
to deliver those who are denied all rights **h and is this day doomed 
to suffer death for his efforts in behalf of those who have no helper: 
Therefore,   Resolved that, while we most decidedly disapprove 
the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects, yet **h in his 
willingness to die in aid of the great cause of human freedom, we still 
recognize the qualities of a noble nature and the exercise of a spirit 
which true men have always admired and which history never fails 
to honor.   Resolved that his wrongs and bereavements in Kansas, 
occasioned by the violence and brutality of those who were intent on 
the propagation of slavery in that territory, call for a charitable 
judgment upon his recent efforts in Virginia to undermine the despotism 
from which he had suffered, and commend his family to the special 
sympathy and aid of all who pity suffering and reverence justice.

Resolved **h that the anti-slavery sentiment is becoming ripe for 
resolute action.   Resolved, that we find in this fearful tragedy 
at Harper's Ferry a reason for more earnest effort to remove the 
evil of slavery from the whole land as speedily as possible **h.

On the morning following the Pratt Hall meeting the editor of the 
Providence <Daily Journal> wrote that although the meeting was 
milder and less extreme than those held in other areas for similar purposes, 
it could have been avoided completely. 
Rather than being deceived, the eye is puzzled; instead of seeing objects 
in space, it sees nothing more than- a picture.   Through 
1911 and 1912, as the Cubist facet-plane's tendency to adhere to 
the literal surface became harder and harder to deny, the task of keeping 
the surface at arm's length fell all the more to eye-undeceiving 
contrivances. To reinforce, and sometimes to replace, the simulated 
typography, Braque and Picasso began to mix sand and other foreign 
substances with their paint; the granular texture thus created likewise 
called attention to the reality of the surface and was effective 
over much larger areas. In certain other pictures, however, Braque began 
to paint areas in exact simulation of wood graining or marbleizing. 
These areas by virtue of their abrupt density of pattern, stated the 
literal surface with such new and superior force that the resulting 
contrast drove the simulated printing into a depth from which it could 
be rescued- and set to shuttling again- only by conventional perspective; 
that is, by being placed in such relation to the forms depicted 
within the illusion that these forms left no room for the typography 
except near the surface.   The accumulation of such devices, 
however, soon had the effect of telescoping, even while separating, 
surface and depth. The process of flattening seemed inexorable, and it 
became necessary to emphasize the surface still further in order to 
prevent it from fusing with the illusion. It was for this reason, and 
no other that I can see, that in September 1912, Braque took the radical 
and revolutionary step of pasting actual pieces of imitation-woodgrain 
wallpaper to a drawing on paper, instead of trying to simulate 
its texture in paint. Picasso says that he himself had already made 
his first collage toward the end of 1911, when he glued a piece of 
imitation-caning 
oilcloth to a painting on canvas. It is true that his first 
collage looks more Analytical than Braque's, which would confirm 
the date he assigns it. But it is also true that Braque was the 
consistent pioneer in the use of simulated textures as well as of typography; 
and moreover, he had already begun to broaden and simplify the 
facet-planes of Analytical Cubism as far back as the end of 1910. 
##

When we examine what each master says was his first collage we 
see that much the same thing happens in each. (It makes no real difference 
that Braque's collage is on paper and eked out in charcoal, 
while Picasso's is on canvas and eked out in oil.) By its greater 
corporeal presence and its greater extraneousness, the affixed paper 
or cloth serves for a seeming moment to push everything else into a more 
vivid <idea> of depth than the simulated printing or simulated textures 
had ever done. But here again, the surface-declaring device both 
overshoots and falls short of its aim. For the illusion of depth created 
by the contrast between the affixed material and everything else 
gives way immediately to an illusion of forms in bas-relief, which gives 
way in turn, and with equal immediacy, to an illusion that seems 
to contain both- or neither.   Because of the size of the areas 
it covers, the pasted paper establishes undepicted flatness <bodily>, 
as more than an indication or sign. Literal flatness now tends to 
assert itself as the main event of the picture, and the device boomerangs: 
the illusion of depth is rendered even more precarious than before. 
Instead of isolating the literal flatness by specifying and circumscribing 
it, the pasted paper or cloth releases and spreads it, and 
the artist seems to have nothing left but this undepicted flatness with 
which to finish as well as start his picture. The actual surface 
becomes both ground and background, and it turns out- suddenly and paradoxically- 
that the only place left for a three-dimensional illusion 
is in <front> of, <upon>, the surface. In their very first collages, 
Braque and Picasso draw or paint <over> and <on> the affixed 
paper or cloth, so that certain of the principal features of their 
subjects <as depicted> seem to thrust out into real, bas-relief space-
