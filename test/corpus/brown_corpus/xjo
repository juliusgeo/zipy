in any aspect of creation it seems to me to be found in human personality, 
whether in Lambarene, Africa, or in Washington, D&C&. One 
cannot read the records of scientists, officials and travelers who 
have penetrated to the minds of the most savage races without realizing 
that each individual met with is a <person>. Read, for instance, 
in 
Malcolm MacDonald's <Borneo People> of Segura and her wise 
father Tomonggong Koh, and her final adjustment to encroaching civilization. 
Above all read in Jens Bjerre's <The Last Cannibals> 
how the old man of the Wailbri tribe (not cannibals) in central Australia 
gave to the white man his choicest possession, while the tears 
streamed down his face. The Australian aborigine is the conventional 
exemplar of degraded humanity; yet here was a depth of sensibility 
which is lacking in a considerable portion of the beneficiaries of our 
civilization.   Persons, whether white, black, brown or yellow, 
are a concern of God. Respect for personality is a privilege and a 
duty for us as brothers.   Such is the field for exercising our 
reverence. As to our action, let us align ourselves with the purpose 
expressed by Jesus in the Lord's Prayer: "Thy kingdom come, 
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven". With the knowledge 
that the kingdom comes by obedience to the moral law in our relations 
with all people, we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the means 
and the ends of our lives.   This intellectual approach to spiritual 
life suited me well, because I was never content to lead a divided 
life. As I have said, words from Tennyson remain ever in my memory: 
"That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as 
before".   Let us now give some thought to the soul. When the 
young biologist, Dr& Ballard, began to show interest in our daughter 
Elizabeth, this induced a corresponding interest, on our part, in 
him. I asked one day what he was doing. He told me that he had a big 
newt and a little newt and that he was transplanting a big eye of the 
big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto 
the big newt. He was then noting that the big eye on the little newt 
hung back until the little eye had grown up to it, while the little 
eye on the big newt grew rapidly until it was as big as the other. Then 
I asked, "What does that teach you"? Said he, "It teaches 
me to wonder".   This was a profound statement. In the face 
of the unfolding universe, our ultimate attitude is that of wonder. 
Wonder is indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world.

Gone are the days when, in the nineteenth century, scientists thought 
that they were close to the attainment of complete knowledge of 
the physical universe. For them only a little more needed to be learned, 
and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sorted, packaged 
and put in the inventory to be drawn on for the solution of any human 
problem.   This complacency was blown to bits by the relativity 
of Einstein, the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the 
discovery of the expanding universe. None of these discoveries were 
neatly rounded off bits of knowledge. Each faded out into the unexplored 
areas of the future.   It is as if we, in our center of human 
observation, from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown. 
As our radius of penetration, ~R, increases, the area of new 
knowledge 
increases by **f, and the total of human knowledge becomes measured 
in terms of **f. Wonder grows. It is endless.   There are 
some people, intelligent people, who seem to be untouched by the sea 
of wonder in which we are immersed and in which we spend our lives. One 
such is Abraham Meyer, the writer of a recent book, <Speaking of 
Man>. This is a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and 
a vigorous defense of pure materialism. His inability to wonder vitiates 
his argument.   The subject of immortality brings to mind a 
vivid incident which took place in 1929 at Montreux in Switzerland.

Criticism is as old as literary art and we can set the stage for 
our study of three moderns if we see how certain critics in the past 
have dealt with the ethical aspects of literature. I have chosen five 
contrasting pairs, ten men in all, and they are arranged in roughly 
chronological order. Such a list must naturally be selective, and the 
treatment of each man is brief, for I am interested only in their general 
ideas on the moral measure of literature. Altogether, the list 
will give us considerable variety in attitudes and some typical ones, 
for these critics range all the way from censors to those who consider 
art above ethics, all the way from Plato to Poe. And most of the 
great periods are represented, because we will compare Plato and Aristotle 
from the golden age of Greece; Stephen Gosson and Sir Philip 
Sidney from renaissance England; Dr& Johnson and William 
Hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in England; 
and James Russell Lowell and Edgar Allan Poe of nineteenth 
century American letters. 

#PLATO AND ARISTOTLE#

Plato and Aristotle 
agree on some vital literary issues. They both measure literature 
by moral standards, and in their political writings both allow for 
censorship, but the differences between them are also significant. While 
Aristotle censors literature only for the young, Plato would banish 
all poets from his ideal state. Even more important, in his <Poetics,> 
Aristotle differs somewhat from Plato when he moves in the 
direction of treating literature as a unique thing, separate and apart 
from its causes and its effects.   All through <The Republic,> 
Plato attends to the way art relates to the general life and ultimately 
to a good life for his citizens. In short, he is constantly concerned 
with the ethical effects. When he discusses the subject matter 
of poetry, he asks what moral effect the scenes will have. When he 
turns briefly to literary style, in the Third Book, he again looks to 
the effect on the audience. He explains that his citizens must not 
be corrupted by any of the misrepresentations of the gods or heroes that 
one finds in much poetry, and he observes that all "these pantomimic 
gentlemen" will be sent to another state. Only those story tellers 
will remain who can "imitate the style of the virtuous".

Plato is, at times, just as suspicious of the poets themselves as he 
is of their work. When he discusses tyrants in the Eighth Book of 
<The Republic,> he pictures the poets as willing to praise the worst 
rulers. But the most fundamental objection he has to poets appears 
in the Tenth Book, and it is derived from his doctrine of ideal forms. 
In Plato's mind there is an irresolvable conflict between the 
poet and the philosopher, because the poet imitates only particular objects 
and is incapable of rising to the first level of abstraction, much 
less the highest level of ideal forms. True reality, of course, is 
the ideal, and the poet knows nothing of this; only the philosopher 
knows the truth.   Poets, moreover, dwell on human passions. And 
with this point about the passions, we encounter Plato's dualism. 
The same sort of thinking plays so large a part in both Babbitt and 
More, that we must examine it in some detail. Plato feels that man 
has two competing aspects, his rational faculty and his irrational. 
We can be virtuous only if we control our lower natures, the passions 
in this case, and strengthen our rational side; and poetry, with all 
its emphasis on the passions, encourages the audience to give way to 
emotion. For this reason, then, poetry tends to weaken the power of 
control, the reason, because it tempts one to indulge his passions, and 
even the best of men, he maintains, may be corrupted by this subtle 
influence.   Plato's attitude toward poetry has always been something 
of an enigma, because he is so completely sensitive to its charm. 
His whole objection, indeed, seems to rise out of a deep conviction 
that the poets <do> have great power to influence, but Plato seldom 
pays any attention to what might be called the poem itself. He is, 
rather, concerned with the effect on society and he wants the poets 
to join his fight for justice. He wants them to use their great power 
to strengthen man's rational side, to teach virtue, and to encourage 
religion.   While Plato finally allows a few acceptable hymns 
to the gods and famous men, still he clearly leaves the way open for 
further discussion of the issue. He even calls upon the poets to defend 
the Muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue. He says: 
"  We 
may further grant to those of her [Poetry's] defenders 
who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets, the permission to 
speak in prose on her behalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant 
but also useful to States and to human life, and we will listen 
in a kindly spirit; for if this can be proved we shall surely be the 
gainers- I mean, if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight".

When we turn to Aristotle's ideas on the moral measure 
of literature, it is at once apparent that he is at times equally concerned 
about the influence of the art. In the ideal state, for instance, 
he argues that the young citizens should hear only the most carefully 
selected tales and stories. For this reason, he would banish indecent 
pictures and speeches from the stage; and the young people should 
not even be permitted to see comedies till they are old enough to 
drink strong wine and sit at the public tables. By the time they reach 
that age, however, Aristotle no longer worries about the evil influence 
of comedies.   In Aristotle's analysis of tragedy in the 
<Poetics,> we find an attempt to isolate the art, to consider only 
those things proper to it, to discover how it differs from other arts, 
and to deal with the effects peculiar to it. He assures us, early 
in the <Poetics,> that all art is "imitation" and that all imitation 
gives pleasure, but he distinguishes between art in general and 
poetic art on the basis of the means, manner, and the objects of the 
imitation. Once the poetic arts are separated from the other forms, 
he lays down his famous definition of tragedy, which sets up standards 
and so lends direction to the remainder of the work. A tragedy, by 
his definition, is an imitation of an action that is serious, of a certain 
magnitude, and complete in itself. It should have a dramatic form 
with pleasing language, and it should portray incidents which so arouse 
pity and fear that it purges these emotions in the audience. Any 
tragedy, he maintains, has six elements: plot, character, and thought 
(the objects of imitation), diction and melody (the means of imitation), 
and spectacle (the manner of imitation). Throughout the rest of 
the <Poetics,> Aristotle continues to discuss the characteristics 
of these six 
parts and their interrelationship, and he refers frequently to the 
standards suggested by his definition of tragedy.   Aristotle's 
method in the <Poetics,> then, does suggest that we should isolate 
the work. The Chicago contingent of modern critics follow Aristotle 
so far in this direction that it is hard to see how they can compare 
one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation. But there are, 
however, several features of Aristotle's approach which open the 
way for the moral measure of literature. For one thing, Aristotle mentions 
that plays may corrupt the audience. In addition, his definition 
of a tragedy invites our attention, because a serious and important 
action may very well be one that tests the moral fiber of the author 
or of the characters. And there is one other point in the poetics that 
invites moral evaluation: Aristotle's notion that the distinctive 
function of tragedy is to purge one's emotions by arousing pity 
and fear. He rejects certain plots because they do not contribute to 
that end. The point is that an ethical critic, with an assist from Freud, 
can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provides us with 
a harmless outlet for our hostile urges. In his study <Samuel Johnson,> 
Joseph Wood Krutch takes this line when he says that what Aristotle 
really means by his theory of catharsis is that our evil passions 
may be so purged by the dramatic ritual that it is "less likely 
that we shall indulge them through our own acts". In Krutch's view, 
this is one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without 
employing the explicit methods of a moralist. And we can add that 
Krutch's interpretation of purgation is also one answer to Plato's 
fear that poetry will encourage our passions. If Krutch is correct, 
tragedy may have quite the opposite effect. It may allay our passions 
and so restore the rule of reason. Or in more Freudian terms, 
the experience may serve to sublimate our destructive urges and strengthen
