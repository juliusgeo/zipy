A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer looks younger than 
his 70 years, has gradually swung from a moderate, internationalist 
position 
to that of a diehard conservative. He is generally and initially 
suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens to benefit his 
Gulf Coast constituents. He is, of course, a segregationist, but 
he says he has never made an "anti-Negro" speech. For 20 years he 
has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee. There his vote, along 
with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia judge, 
and the four Republican members, could and often did produce a 6-6 
deadlock that blocked far-out, 
Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation 
(a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-Johnson congressional leadership 
to avoid embarrassing votes). _EQUAL TREATMENT._ There was 
sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster: he had given his 
lukewarm support to the anti-Kennedy electors in Mississippi. Reprisals 
are not unheard of in such situations, but the recent tendency has 
been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons. In 1949 the Dixiecrats 
escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry 
Truman, and in 1957, 
after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned 
for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, his fellow Democrats did not touch 
his committee assignments, although they did strip him temporarily 
of his patronage. (In the heat of the anti-Colmer drive last week, 
Judge 
Smith threatened reprisal against Powell. Said he: "We will 
see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here".) 
But Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach with 
President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year something had to be 
done about the Rules Committee- and that he was the only man who could 
do anything effective.   In a tense, closed-door session with 
Judge Smith, Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise: to add 
three new members to the Rules Committee (two Democrats, including 
one Southerner, and one Republican). Smith flatly rejected the offer, 
and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels. The next 
morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and 
broke the news: he would lead the fight to oust Colmer, whom he 
is said to regard as "an inferior man".   News of 
Rayburn's 
commitment soon leaked out. When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got 
the word, he turned purple. "Unconscionable"! he shouted, and 
rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object: "A dangerous precedent"! 
Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome support 
to the Smith-Colmer forces: as chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding 
this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects. 
Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge 
Smith ally, Georgia's Carl Vinson, chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee. _THREAT OF WAR._ As the battle raged in the cloakrooms 
and caucuses, it became clear that Judge Smith could lose. His 
highest count of supporters numbered 72- and he needed nearly twice 
that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus. The liberals, 
smelling blood, were faced with the necessity of winning three 
big votes- in the Democratic Committee on Committees, in the full 
party caucus, and on the floor of the House- before they could oust 
Colmer. (One big question: If Colmer was to be purged, what should 
the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported 
the maverick electors?) In all three arenas, they seemed certain 
of victory- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash.

But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter 
of losing a costlier war. If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused, 
they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons 
from their vantage point of committee chairmanships, leaving Sam 
Rayburn leading a truncated, unworkable party. With that possibility 
in mind, Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a 
meeting of the Committee on Committees, and coolheaded Democrats sought 
to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort 
of face-saving compromise. "Here are two old men, mad at each other 
and too proud to pick up the phone", said a House Democratic leader. 
"One wants a little more power, and the other doesn't want 
to give up any". _BATTLE IN THE SENATE_ The Senate launched the 
87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative 
battle, but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed 
as <pro forma> as a Capitol guide's speech. Question at issue: 
How big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate- and 
thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters?   A wide-ranging, 
bipartisan force- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey 
to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall- was 
drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats, who have traditionally 
used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills. New Mexico's 
Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's 
notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and 
voting to cut off debate, instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds. 
Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power for a 
mere majority of Senators. Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely, 
and the battle was joined.   Privately, the liberals admitted 
that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage. Privately, 
they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths 
modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon. 
In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of 
Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each 
new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were 
not binding.   Armed with the Nixon opinion, the Senate liberals 
rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate 
on the filibuster battle this week. Hopefully, the perennial battle 
of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all. 

#REPUBLICANS# 


_LAST ACT_ Since Election Day, Vice President 
Richard Nixon had virtually retired- by his own wish- from public 
view. But with the convening of the new Congress, he was the public 
man again, presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration. 
One day last week, Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore 
that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to 
hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote, and then to 
make "sufficient declaration" of the election of the man who defeated 
him in the tight 1960 presidential election. Nixon fulfilled his 
assignment with grace, then went beyond the required "sufficient declaration".

"This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate 
for the presidency announced the result of an election in which 
he was defeated", he said.

The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do 
to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves. Gary Player, the small, 
trim South African, was the eventual winner, but in all his 25 
years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the 
victory to drop in his lap. Arnold Palmer, the defending champion, lost 
his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that 
left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.   "Just when you 
think you have it licked, this golf course can get up and bite you", 
Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament. And 
that is just what happened on the last few holes. The Augusta National 
Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer.

Player was the first to feel its teeth. After playing a splendid first 
nine holes in 34- two strokes under par- on this fifth and final 
day of the tournament (Sunday's fourth round had been washed out 
by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed), Player's 
game rapidly fell to pieces. He bogeyed the 10th. After a journey through 
woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th. He bogeyed the 15th 
by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three 
holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total 
of 280.   As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course, 
Player was almost in tears. He could read on the nearby scoreboard 
that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole, was leading him by a stroke. 
Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player, and at 
one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes. Now 
all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the 
biggest single paycheck in golf.   When Palmer hit a good straight 
drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship 
won. But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green 
strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression. In trying to 
hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green, 
past spectators and down the slope toward a ~TV tower.   Afterwards, 
Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round partner, that he 
simply played the hole too fast. He did seem hasty on his second and 
third shots, but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while 
Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to recover his 
composure, 
which he had quite visibly lost.   When the shaken Palmer 
finally did hit his fourth shot, he overshot the hole by 15 feet. 
Palmer was now putting merely for a tie, and Player, who was sitting 
beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman 
Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment, stared in amazement when 
Palmer missed the putt.   Palmer's 281 for the four rounds 
at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest 
pro, but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe. 
The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur, who has been playing topnotch 
tournament golf for many years, refused to let the Masters jitters 
overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69. 

#END 
AT SEVEN#

Until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played 
seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters- four last year 
and three this- without ever being out of first place. As evening 
approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing 
one-over-par 73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks to 
his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69. His three-round total 
of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score, a 213 by Bill 
Collins, the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing 
very well all winter long.   But Palmer knew, as did everybody 
else at Augusta, that his streak was about to be broken. Half an hour 
after he finished his round, Player holed out at the 18th green with 
a 69 and a three-round total of 206, four strokes ahead of Palmer.

More than a streak had ended. Long after the erratic climate 
and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological 
footnotes, the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the 
<mano a mano> between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. Unlike most 
such sports rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously, 
although this was not exactly the case.   When the winter 
tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to 
challenge Palmer's towering prestige. As if to confirm his stature, 
he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments. Player won only 
one. But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago, Player was 
leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars, and the 
rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere. On the final round at 
Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same 
threesome and, although it was far from obvious at the time, the gallery 
was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of 
the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.   On 
that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading 
the tournament and, as it turned out, neither won it. But whichever 
of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial
