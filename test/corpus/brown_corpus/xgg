to him and, he feels, not to anyone else). He is required to 
mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his. 
All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated, by adding 
up the Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those in the 
sitter's own reading. That is, if he marks as most correct a reading 
<not> meant for him, the total experimental score falls.   Conversely, 
if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading, and finds more 
accurate facts in it than in the others, a point is chalked up for 
the intrinsic, objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material. 
And there are some positive results, though the final findings 
will not be known for a long time- and then further research can 
be formulated.   In another approach to the same procedure, the 
content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium 
is likely to slant her statements. Does she often speak of locations, 
of cause of death? Does she accurately give dates, ages, kind 
of occupation? It is possible to find out in which categories most 
of her correct statements fall, and where she makes most of her "hits". 
Now when, so to speak, the cream has been skimmed off, and the 
items in the successful categories separated out, the sitter can be asked 
to consider and rate only this concentrated "cream", where the 
sensitive is at her best. ##

MEDIUMISTIC IMPRESSIONS are evidently 
of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses. "I feel cold", 
the medium says, or "My leg aches", "My head is heavy". 
Or perhaps she hears words or sounds: "There's such a noise 
of loud machinery", or "I hear a child crying", or "He says 
we're all here and glad to see you". Maybe an entire scene comes 
into consciousness, with action and motion, or a static view: "a 
house under a pine tree, with a little stone path going up to the door". 
The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors, too, or subjectively 
feels emotions. Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery 
and seems to see all details in perspective, as if the scene were actually 
there. If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she may be able 
to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply, almost 
as if she were physically going closer.   If asked how she gets 
her impressions, she probably can only say that she "just gets them"- 
some more vividly than others. Perhaps this is not so extraordinary 
after all. Even in normal experience one gets impressions without 
knowing exactly how- of atmosphere, of one another's personalities, 
moods, intentions.   Of course, there is an element of training 
here: these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance, 
have 
learned to develop their power. Simply <using> it increases its intensity, 
I was told by one sensitive.   Nor does a medium automatically 
know how to interpret her imagery. Impressions often appear in 
a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value. It is apparently 
by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious, and the medium 
has to translate these into meaning. If communication with an entity 
on the "other side" is taking place, this too may assume the form 
of clairvoyant symbolism.   During one reading an image appeared 
of a prisoner in irons. But this did not necessarily refer to an 
actual jail; taken with other details it could have referred to a state 
of mental or spiritual confinement. In this connection it is worth 
noting how names are sometimes obtained. Though they are often heard 
clairaudiently, as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they 
are apprehended visually as symbols: a slope to signify the name 
"Hill", for instance. One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line 
and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter. 
_@_ Farming is confining. The farmer's life must be arranged 
to meet the demands of crops and livestock.   Livestock must be 
tended every day, routinely. A slight change in the work schedule may 
cut the production of cows or chickens.   Even if there are no 
livestock, the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods, particularly 
during the growing season.   The worker who lives on a farm 
cannot change jobs readily. He cannot leave the farm to take work 
in another locality on short notice; such a move may mean a loss of 
capital. _@_ Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part 
of farm life. The farmer must get up early, and, at times, work late 
at night. Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold 
rain. No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected 
setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.   It may 
not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery 
that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably. _@_ Production 
may fall far below expectations. Drought, hail, disease, and insects 
take their toll of crops. Sickness or loss of some of the livestock 
may cut into the owner's earnings, even into his capital. _@_ 
Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good 
year.   The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult 
to farm profitably on a part-time basis. Land within commuting 
distance of a growing city is usually high in price, higher if it has 
subdivision possibilities. Part-time farmers generally must pay higher 
prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller 
quantities. If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high, 
farm labor costs will also be high.   A part-time farmer needs 
unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre 
as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer. It will frequently 
be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment. He 
may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations, 
such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his 
turn. There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he 
is away at his off-farm job. _@_ The farm may be an additional 
burden if the main job is lost. This may be true whether the farm is 
owned or rented.   If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid. 
If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free 
of mortgage, there will be interest and 
payments on the principal to take care of. _ADVANTAGES_ _@_A 
farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children. 
It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air. The children can 
do chores adapted to their age and ability. Caring for a calf, a pig, 
or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for 
work. _@_ Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the 
regular job is lost, <provided> the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes 
enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs. 
_@_ For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way 
to supplement retirement income. It is particularly suitable for those 
who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health. _@_ 
Generally, the s 
ame level of living costs less in the country than 
in the city. The savings are not as great, however, as is sometime supposed. 
Usually, the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on 
the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more. 
Where schools, fire and police protection, and similar municipal services 
are of equal quality in city and country, real estate taxes are 
usually about the same. _@_ A part-time farmer and his family can 
use their spare time profitably. _@_ Some persons consider the 
work on a farm recreational. For some white-collar workers it is a 
welcome change from the regular job, and a physical conditioner. 

#LAND, 
LABOR, AND EQUIPMENT NEEDED#

Part-time farming can take comparatively 
little land, labor, and equipment- or a great deal. It depends 
on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.   General 
requirements for land, labor, and equipment are discussed below. Specific 
requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed 
on pages 8 to 14. _LAND_ Three quarters to 1 acre of good land 
is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a 
small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs. You could not, of course, 
raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.   If you 
want to 
raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll 
need more land.   In deciding how much land you want, take into 
account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect. But 
consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your 
other work. The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in 
value may influence your decision. Some part-time farmers buy more 
land than they need in anticipation of suburban development. This is 
a highly speculative venture.   Sometimes a desired acreage is offered 
only as part of a larger tract. When surplus land is not expensive 
to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy 
so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might 
impair the residential value of the farm. _LABOR_ If you have a 
year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your 
family uses- unless other members of the family do a good deal of 
the work or you hire help. As a rule, part-time farmers hire little 
help.   In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor, 
compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with 
the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.   List 
the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month. 
You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have 
one. Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare 
time- only what you are willing to use for farm work. _EQUIPMENT_ 
If you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only 
hand tools. You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing, 
however.   For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power 
for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating. If you have a planting 
of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor 
(available for $300 to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices). These 
tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier 
soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.

Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the 
small-scale farmer. If you are going to farm for extra cash income on 
a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments 
when you choose among farm enterprises.   You can keep your 
machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing 
the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring 
someone with machinery to do certain jobs. If an expensive and specialized 
piece of machinery is needed- such as a spray rig, a combine, 
or a binder- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work. 

#SELECTING A FARM#

Before you look for a farm you'll need 
to know (1) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake; and 
(2) 
whether you want to buy or rent.   Information on pages 8 to 14 
may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.

If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish 
to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like 
and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent 
a place for a year or two before you buy.   Discussed below are 
some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm. 
_LOCATION_ _NEARNESS TO WORK.-_ Choose a location within easy 
commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities. 
Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell 
the farm. The presence of alternative job opportunities also will 
make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable. 
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road. _NEARNESS TO 
MARKETS.-_ If you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby. 
If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example, 
you should be close to a town or city. _KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD.-_ 
Look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes. There are slums 
in the country as well as in the city. Few rural areas are protected 
by zoning. A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, 
or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to 
hurt its value. _FACILITIES IN THE AREA.-_ Check on the schools
