counts for nothing among those who have learned to know life <sub 
specie aeternitatis">. I had always thought of that lovable man 
as many years older than myself, although he was perhaps only twenty 
years older, and he confirmed my feeling, along with the feeling of both 
my sons, that teachers of the classics are invariably endearing. I 
must have written to say how much I had enjoyed his fine book <The 
Building 
of Eternal Rome>, and I found he had not regretted giving 
me the highest mark in his old course on the later Latin poets, although 
in my final examination I had ignored the questions and filled the 
bluebook with a comparison of Propertius and Coleridge. He had written 
to me about a dinner he had had with the Benedictine monks at St& 
Anselm's Priory in Washington. There had been reading at table, 
especially from two books, Pope Gregory the Great's account 
of St& Scholastica in his <Dialogues> and my own <The World 
of Washington Irving>. He said, "Some have criticized your book 
as 
being neither literary criticism nor history. Of course it was not 
meant to be. Some have felt that Washington Irving comes out rather 
slimly, but let them look at the title of the book". He felt as 
I felt about this best of all my books, that it was "really tops".

Two or three times, C& C& Burlingham came to lunch with 
us in Weston, that wonderful man who lived to be more than a hundred 
years old and whose birthplace had been my Wall Street suburb. His 
reading ranged from Agatha Christie to the Book of Job and he had 
an insatiable interest in his fellow-creatures, while his letters were 
full of gossip about new politicians and old men of letters with whom 
he had been intimately thrown six decades before. I could never forget 
the gaiety with which, when he was both blind and deaf, he let me 
lead him around his rooms to look at some of the pictures; and once 
when he came to see us in New York he walked away in a rainstorm, 
unwilling to hear of a taxi or even an umbrella, although he was at the 
time ninety years old. There were several men of ninety or more whom 
I knew first or last, all of whom were still productive and most of 
whom knew one another as if they had naturally come together at the apex 
of their lives. I never met John Dewey, whose style was a sort 
of verbal fog and who had written asking me to go to Mexico with him 
when he was investigating the cause of Trotsky; but I liked to think 
of him at ninety swimming and working at Key West long after Hemingway 
had moved to Cuba. At Lee Simonson's house, I had dined 
with Edith Hamilton, the nonogenarian rationalist and the charming scholar 
who had a great popular success with <The Greek Way>. Then 
there was Mark Howe and there was Henry Dwight Sedgwick, an accomplished 
man of letters who wrote in the spirit of Montaigne and produced 
in the end a formidable body of work. I saw Sedgwick often before 
his death at ninety-five,- he had remarried at the age of ninety,- 
and he asked me, when once I returned from Rome, if I knew the 
Cavallinis in the church of St& Cecilia in Trastevere. I had to 
confess that I had missed these frescoes, recently discovered, that 
he had studied in his eighties. Sedgwick had chosen to follow the philosophy 
of Epicurus whom, with his followers, Dante put in hell; but 
he defended the doctrine in <The Art of Happiness>, and what indeed 
could be said against the Epicurean virtues, health, frugality, 
privacy, culture and friendship? Of Mark Antony De Wolfe Howe 
the philosopher Whitehead said the Earth's first visitors to Mars 
should be persons likely to make a good impression, and when he was 
asked, "Whom would you send"? he replied, "My first choice 
would be Mark Howe". This friend of many years came once to visit 
us in the house at Weston. Then I spoke at the ninetieth birthday 
party of W& E& Burghardt Du Bois, who embarked on a fictional 
trilogy at eighty-nine and who, with <The Crisis>, had created a 
Negro intelligentsia that had never existed in America before him. As 
their interpreter and guide, he had broken with Tuskegee and become 
a spokesman of the coloured people of the world.   Mr& Burlingham,- 
"C&C&B&"- wrote to me once about an old friend 
of mine, S& K& Ratcliffe, whom I had first met in London in 
1914 and who also came out for a week-end in Weston. "Did you ever 
know a man with greater zest for information? And his memory, like 
an elephant's, stored with precise knowledge of men and things and 
happenings". His wife, Katie, "as gay as a lark and as lively 
as a gazelle",- she was then seventy-six,- had a "a sense of humour 
that has been denied S&K&, but neither has any aesthetic perceptions. 
People and books are enough for them". S&K& was visiting 
C&C&B& and, not waiting for breakfast, he was off to 
the University Club, where he spent hours writing obituaries of living 
Americans for the <Manchester guardian> or the <Glasgow Herald>. 
Later, rising ninety, he was beset by publishers for the story 
of his life and miracles, as he put it, but, calling himself the Needy 
Knife-grinder, he had spent his time writing short articles and long 
letters and could not get even a small popular book done. Then, all 
but blind, he said there was nothing in <Back to Methuselah>,- 
"G&B&S& ought to have known that",- and "I look at my 
bookshelves despairingly, knowing that I can have nothing more to do 
with them". However, at eighty-five, he had still been busy writing 
articles, reviewing and speaking, and I had never before known an 
Englishman who had visited and lectured in three quarters of the United 
States. Finally, colleges and clubs took the line that speakers 
from England were not wanted any longer, even speakers like S&K&, 
so unlike the novelists and poets who had patronized the Americans 
for many years. With their facile generalizations about the United 
States, these mediocrities, as they often were, had been great successes. 
While S&K& did not like Dylan Thomas, I liked his poems 
very much, but I made the mistake of telling Dylan Thomas so, whereupon 
he said to me, "I suppose you think you know all about me". 
I should have replied, "I probably know something about the best 
part of you". But I only thought of that in the middle of the night.

Many years later I went to see S&K& in England, where 
he was living at Whiteleaf, near Aylesbury, and he showed me beside 
his cottage there the remains of the road on which Boadicea is supposed 
to have travelled. He was convinced that George Orwell's <1984> 
was nearly all wrong as it applied to England, which was "driving 
forward into uncharted waters", with the danger of a new tyranny 
ahead. "But however we go, whatever our doom, it will not take the 
Orwellian shape". With facts mainly in his mind, he was often acute 
in the matter of style, and he said, "The young who have as yet 
nothing to say will try larks with initial letters and broken lines. 
But put them before a situation which they are forced to depict",- 
he was speaking of the Spanish civil war,- "and they have no hesitation; 
they merely do their best to make it real for others". 
He looked at her as she spoke, then got up as she was speaking still, 
and, simply and wordlessly, walked out. And that was the end. Or nearly.

He went to the Hotel Mayflower and telegraphed Mencken. 
Would he meet him in Baltimore in Drawing Room ~A, Car Three 
on the train leaving Washington at nine o'clock next morning? 
They would go to New York together, where parties would be piled on 
weariness and on misery. But not for long. Both Alfred Harcourt and 
Donald Brace had written him enthusiastic praise of <Elmer Gantry> 
(any changes could be made in proof, which was already coming from 
the printer) and they had ordered 140,000 copies- the largest first 
printing of any book in history. But none of this could soothe the 
exacerbated nerves. On New Year's Eve, Alfred Harcourt drove 
him up the Hudson to Bill Brown's Training Camp, a well-known establishment 
for the speedy if temporary rehabilitation of drunkards who 
could no longer help themselves. But, in departing, Lewis begged 
Breasted that there be no liquor in the apartment at the Grosvenor on 
his return, and he took with him the first thirty galleys of <Elmer 
Gantry>.   On January 4, with the boys back at school and college, 
Mrs& Lewis wrote Harcourt to say that she was "thro, quite 
thro". "This whole Washington venture was my last gesture, 
and it has failed. Physically as well as mentally I have reached the 
limit of my endurance. My last gift to him is complete silence until 
the book is out and the first heated discussion dies down. For him to 
divorce God and wife simultaneously would be bad publicity. I am 
really ill at the present moment, and I will go to some sort of a sanitarium 
to normalize myself". And she withdrew then to Cromwell 
Hall, in Cromwell, Connecticut.   Harcourt replied: "I do 
really hope you can achieve serenity in the course of time. Of course 
I hope Hal can also, but those hopes are much more faint".

ON JANUARY 8, 1927, he returned to the Grosvenor in high 
spirits, and looking fit. He had been, he wrote Mencken at once, "in 
the country", a euphemism for an experience that had not greatly 
changed him. Charles Breasted remembers that, before unpacking his bag, 
he telephoned his bootlegger with a generous order, and almost at 
once "the familiar procession of people began milling through our living 
room at any hour between two P&M& and three A&M&". 
They were strays of every kind- university students and journalists, 
Village hangers-on and barflies, taxi drivers and editors and unknown 
poets, as well as friends like Elinor Wylie and William Rose Benet, 
the Van Dorens and Nathan, Rebecca West and Hugh Walpole 
and Osbert Sitwell, Laurence Stallings, Lewis Browne, William Seabrook, 
Arthur Hopkins, the Woodwards. When he came home from his 
office at the end of the afternoon, Breasted never knew what gathering 
he should expect to find, but there almost always was one. 
He did not neglect his wife in Cromwell Hall, but telephoned her and 
wrote her with assurances of his continuing interest and of his wish 
to "stand behind" her in their separation and of his hope that there 
would be no bitterness between them. She was occupying herself in 
an attempt to write an article about the variety of houses that they 
had rented abroad. He was of unsettled mind as to whether he should go 
abroad when the <Gantry> galleys were finished. For a time, urging 
Breasted to give up his public relations work and take up writing 
instead, he hoped to persuade him to become his assistant in research 
for the labor novel; if Breasted agreed, they would get a car and tour 
the country, visiting every kind of industrial center. When Breasted 
insisted that this was impossible for him, Lewis decided to go abroad.

He telephoned L& M& Birkhead and asked him and his 
wife to come to Europe as his guests, but Birkhead declined on the 
grounds that one of them must be in the United States when <Elmer 
Gantry> was published. Lewis was spending his mornings, with the 
help of two secretaries, on the galleys of that long novel, making considerable 
revisions, and the combination of hard work and hard frivolity 
exhausted him once more, so that he was compelled to spend three days 
in the Harbor Sanatorium in the last week of January. Before he 
made that retreat, he telephoned Earl Blackman in Kansas City and 
asked him to come to Europe with him. Blackman was to be in New York 
by February 2, because they were sailing at 12:01 next morning. 
Lewis told him what clothes he should bring along, and enjoined him 
not to buy anything that he did not already own, they would do that 
in New York. Blackman arrived a day or two early, and Lewis took him 
to a department store immediately and outfitted him, luggage and all, 
and then he took him to a party at the Woodwards that went on until 
four in the morning.   On the evening that they were to sail, 
Lewis himself gave a party, but he was too indisposed to appear at it. 
Woodward took occasion to warn Blackman about Lewis's drinking 
and urged him to "try to keep him sober". After a dinner party for 
which she had come down to New York, Mrs& Lewis and Casanova 
arrived to see them off, and Elinor Wylie made tart observations that 
indicated that Lewis had been less discreet than he had promised to 
be about the real nature of their separation. Nevertheless, Mrs& 
Lewis was still solicitous of his condition: let him do as he wished, 
let him sleep with chambermaids if he must, but, she begged Blackman, 
try to keep him from drinking a great deal and bring him back in 
good health. As they stood at the first-class rail, waving down to his
