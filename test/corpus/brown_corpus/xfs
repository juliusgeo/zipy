The final choice of material depends upon such factors as 
costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity, number of units 
required, time available for tooling, and projected life expectancy of 
the unit. Often, the finished sign or display incorporates several types 
of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques. 

#TRANS-ILLUMINATED 
BILLBOARDS#

One of the most significant advancements in design 
of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard, now 
being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance 
Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, and Industrial Electric Inc&, 
New Orleans, La&.   The essential difference between the new 
trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former, 
constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted from within. 
With the source of light behind the copy, there is no loss of lumen output, 
as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light. 
Also, the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure 
and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.   The copy itself, 
including any text or illustrations, is reproduced in full color directly 
on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process. The 
film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto 
the acrylic panels forming the sign, and also to be stripped off for 
replacement by new copy as required. Spare sets of face panels simplify 
the change from one copy or message to another; new panels are exchanged 
for the old right in the field on a single trip. Panels with 
outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.

Signs of this type have already made their appearance 
in several larger cities, and others are on the way. It is believed that 
these boards will, within the next few years, replace many of the 
conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.   Trans-illuminated 
signs also show versatility in other directions. As used by Industrial 
Electric Inc&, the film panels are printed one at a time, as 
are 24-sheet posters. Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent 
plastics faces; they can also be applied to opaque panels 
for use on cutouts, or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin 
faces. In this way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying 
uniform copy on different sign media.   Recently Industrial 
Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern 
plastic materials- a revolving spectacular sign. Comprised of 16 
triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible to 
combine three different signs in a single unit. The triangles automatically 
revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec& of viewing time for 
each poster subject. Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft& 
wide, make up the 25-ft& length of the sign. 

#CHANGEABLE LETTERS 
FILL MANY NEEDS#

Perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility 
of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays 
would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this 
complex field- changeable signs.   Signs are meant to convey 
a message, and in most cases, this requires words and letters. Frequently, 
the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products, 
price changes, etc&. The huge market for changeable signs has spurred 
a universal demand for individual plastic letters, in all shapes 
and sizes- and a number of companies are set up to supply them. Here 
are some of the newer items currently available:   Poster Products 
Inc&, Chicago, Ill&: a changeable copy and display 
sign 
which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of 
colors, onto which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words screened 
on acetate or other types of sheet stock. The background, which 
is available 
in various widths and continuous lengths, is extruded with 
parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.

The Adaptaplex Co&, Beaverton, Ore&; letters molded 
of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red or black. Ideal 
for merchandising use, they are weather-resistant, and have mounting 
pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern 
background panel.   For large letters, <e&g&> thermoformed 
of acrylic or butyrate, there are other techniques. For example, 
in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in& and six 36-in& red 
acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background. 
The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb& each made 
it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic 
angle brackets cemented to the letters. Stainless steel screws were 
used to minimize corrosion stains. For mounting to corrugated plastic 
backgrounds, very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters 
and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings, its ends 
twisted behind the panels.   Large injection-molded letters are 
also available for sign installations. Wagner Sign Service Inc&, 
Chicago, for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights of 
4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches. They are molded of a special weather-resistant 
formulation of Tenite butyrate. Also available from this company 
are Snug-Grip Plasti-Bars, extruded of transparent acrylic material, 
which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material. 
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft&, the bars are shaped in cross 
section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back 
of the letters.   Still another approach to the changeable letter 
type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products, Azusa, 
Calif&. This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in& (or 
smaller) panels formed of 0.080-in& clear butyrate sheet stock, masked 
and sprayed on the rear side. Finished signs are produced by sliding 
the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in& aluminum, 
which may be mounted to various surfaces. The sheets are extruded of 
Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&.

On large-area units, where additional structural requirements 
are imposed, one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed 
channels (<e&g&> right-angled corrugations) of the acrylic or butyrate. 
Joined side by side, such channels make possible construction 
of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft& high and 
of unlimited width. Letters may be wired to the face of the combined 
channels, painted on the first surface, or handled in other ways. 

#NEW RULE NO& 2: DON'T BUILD FROM THE OUTSIDE IN- TRY TO BUILD 
FROM 
THE INSIDE OUT#

Don't insert your components into fixed openings, 
they may or may not fit; position your components before you close 
them in. For example:   Don't wall in your kitchen before 
you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances. It's a lot quicker 
and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect 
the end wall after they are all in place.   Set your bathtub before 
you close in the end of the bathroom. Don't try to wrestle a 
400-~lb tub **f through a narrow doorway.   Finish your plumbing 
before you frame it in (most economical framing is a thin non-bearing 
partition on either side of the pipes).   Finish installing and 
connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them 
in. There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a 
furnace in a finished **f closet.   Don't position your studs 
before you insert your windows in conventional construction; that way 
you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the 
window. You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows 
in one, two, three order- first the stud on one side, then the window, 
then the stud on the other side.   Install your disappearing 
stair (or stairs) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before 
you drywall the ceiling.   Don't close in your house until everything 
has been carried in. Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall 
between the house and garage. That way he can truck his parts right 
indoors and unload them under the roof.   No auto maker would 
dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons 
in the block. And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore 
most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds of dollars 
by always building from the inside out. 

#NEW RULE NO& 3 RETHINK 
EVERYTHING 
TO GET ALL THE BIG SAVINGS THE REVOLUTION IN MATERIALS HANDLING 
OFFERS YOU#

This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less 
news of all, because **h _1._ It makes it easy to handle much heavier 
units, so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated 
components like those shown in the pictures alongside. _2._ 
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that (like 
earthmoving and roadbuilding) should be lower today than in 1929. _3._ 
It changes the answers to "Who should do what, and where"? 
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases 
the chance for shop fabrication, where almost everything can be made 
better and cheaper. _4._ It changes the answers on when to do what 
at the site. For example, instead of putting in your driveways last 
(as many builders do) you can now save money by putting them in first. 
Instead of closing the house in first (as most builders do) you can 
now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to (<see 
~p 
121>). _5._ It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations. 
Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs 
by "buying direct" and short-cutting the dealer. But now many of 
these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming 
up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient 
specialized equipment 
to deliver everything just where it is needed- 
drywall inside the house, siding along the sides, trusses on the walls, 
roofing on the roof, etc&.   Says Clarence Thompson: "We 
dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder 
cheaper than he could do it himself". The revolution now under 
way in materials handling makes this much easier. _THE REVOLUTION 
IS WELL UNDER WAY, BUT MUCH MORE REMAINS TO BE DONE_ Five years ago 
a HOUSE + HOME Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' 
Research Council reported unhappily:   "Only one lumber 
dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads; only one box car 
in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads; only one producer 
in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads; only one builder 
in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.   "So 
from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling 
(most of it inefficient) add up to one-fourth of the total construction 
cost of housing".   "That HOUSE + HOME Round Table 
was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials 
handling", says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' 
Research Council. "It made our whole industry recognize 
the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer, carrier, equipment 
maker, dealer, and builder, all working together to cut the cost 
of materials handling. Before that we lumber dealers were working 
almost single-handed on the problem". _HERE IS WHERE THINGS STAND 
TODAY:_ _1._ Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater 
primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new 
houses are mechanized. There are few areas left where a builder cannot 
find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything 
at lower cost just where his workmen will need it. _2._ Practically 
all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized 
or unitized for mechanical handling- including lumber, asphalt 
shingles, glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard, gypsum 
wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation sheathing, floor tile, acoustical
