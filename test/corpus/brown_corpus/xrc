like to get in on the handhold and wrestles". He looked down at his 
big hands and slowly flexed his long fingers. "Don't reckon there's 
nobody out there, 'cept maybe Dan, who can outgrip me, Harmony".

With Rod on his way and Matilda visiting with Mrs& 
Jackson while they searched out familiar names on the face of the cliff, 
Harmony settled on the edge of the grub box, to ease the pressure 
of her swollen body on her bone-weary legs, and worried about all that 
might have happened to Sally. And she was deeply thankful that she 
could see her now, out there in the midst of a gay, youthful circle, 
skipping and singing, "Farmer in the dell, Farmer in the dell, Heigh-ho 
the dairy-oh, the farmer in the dell".   At the sight 
of Sally's happy face and carefree expression, Harmony's dark, brooding 
eyes quickly brightened with unshed tears. She was glad, completely 
and unselfishly glad, to see that things were working out the right 
way for both Sally and Dan. **h And she really tried to go a step 
further and say she hoped they'd be just as right as they now were 
for her and for Rod. But she couldn't, not yet. Not with the memory 
of her folks and the lost Conestoga still holding her close **h.

Out in the center of the circle the farmer, who was Dan, wasted 
no time when they came to the line, "The farmer choose his wife". 
With a swift swoop of his big arms, he grabbed Sally out of the 
circle surrounding him, and then kissed her soundly before setting her 
down so she could stand by his side while they jointly chose the rest 
of their "outfit". Soon the child, the dog, the cat **h and even 
the cheese, all joined them out there in the circle.   By now 
Harmony could see that most of the adults in the train were winded and 
resting, or else siphoned off from the games by the challenging lure 
of the great cliff towering above them. No matter how many registry 
rocks they came to on this journey, each one exerted its own appeal. 
Even strange names seemed to make them feel closer to some kind of civilization 
when stumbled across out here in this wilderness. Already 
a few hardy folk from their own train were zealously chipping away at 
the register rocks, leaving their own records along with those made by 
the earlier trains. Soon she saw Rod and Hez moving over to join them.

No sooner were they through and the guards posted, than the 
whole camp turned in for a night of sound sleep. For Matilda, it 
was the first she had known in many a night. Even the knowledge that 
she was losing another boy, as a mother always does when a marriage is 
made, did not prevent her from having the first carefree, dreamless sleep 
that she had known since they dropped down the canyon and into Bear 
Valley, way, way back there when they were crossing those other mountains.

Next morning, they moved on again.   "My souls' 
a-gracious"! Gran Harrow exclaimed, watching their rippling 
muscles as Rod and Dan swung her up into the load. "A body would 
swear I floated right up here on a cloud"!   Rod and Dan 
released their holds on the arms of her hickory rocker and exchanged 
embarrassed grins. "Shucks, Gran", they said almost in unison. "That 
wasn't nothing at all"!   Leaning forward in her chair, 
Gran nearsightedly scrutinized Dan's face. "How's Sally 
like rubbin' agin that thar little ticklebrush ye're a-raising"?

"Quit ragging him, Gran", Rod protested.   "I 
ain't ragging him"! Gran peered again at the week-old blond 
mustache shadowing Dan's upper lip. "But honest-to-Betsy, I've 
seed more hair than that on a piece o' bacon".   The two 
tall 
brothers waited silently while their mother handed Gran her cold 
snack and water jug, placed the chamber pot beside her feet, and returned 
to her place at the front of the wagon with Alice.   "Rheumatics 
worse, Pa"? Dan asked Hez, who had limped back from his 
team to hold the notched-stick chair braces in place while his boys swung 
up the tailgate and tied it tight at the ends.   "My right 
leg's stiff as a board this morning", he replied. "But the sun'll 
fry it out'n me onct we git to rolling".   The three 
men stepped out to the side to wait for Captain Clemens' signal.

Hez looked up at the high face of Emigrant Rock, official signboard 
for the Raft River turnoff, and gloated, "Seems funny that 
them Burnsides never took time to leave their John-Henry up thar".

"Wonder what made them hurry so", Rod drawled, giving 
Dan a sly wink.   Dan grinned, and changed the subject. "From 
now on, Sally and me and her folks aim to give you our turn when it 
comes up and fall in behind you and Rod's outfit".   "Ain't 
no sense you eating our dust", Rod protested.   "Sally 
and her ma want to trade off on account of Harmony being so far along", 
Dan explained. "Jackson recruited his critters, and him and 
me fixed up his wagon while we was waiting for you to catch up. He's 
got the tightest running gear in the train now. Besides, 'tain't 
no more'n right for me to follow with my black oxen, so's I can 
unhook and pull up fast if either of you get in a pinch".   Captain 
Clemens' signal shot sent the men hurrying to their waiting 
teams.   "Reckon ye're right, Dan", Hez called back over 
his shoulder. "I'll shore be needing ye both on the pull out o' 
the canyon".   Rod looked apprehensively ahead at the narrowing, 
precipice-walled gorge. "We'll double teams zigzagging up the 
mountain, Harmony", he spoke reassuringly, concerned by the pinched 
look around her mouth. "Like enough we'll all be up on top by 
sundown".   Out of the corner of his eye, he could see his father's 
wheels beginning to turn.   Before Harmony had a chance 
to reply, Rod cracked his long whip over his thin oxen's backs **h. 
While no larger than Dutch Springs, this mining supply town had 
the 
appearance of being far busier and more prosperous. Men crowded the streets 
and freight rigs and teams were moving about. Although they were 
forced to maintain a sharper watch, this activity enabled them to ride 
in and rack their broncs without any particular attention being paid 
them.   "Gyp'll be holdin' forth in some bar if he's 
here at all", Cobb declared, glancing along the street as they stretched 
their legs.   There were no less than six or seven saloons 
in Ganado, not counting the lower class dives, all vying for the trade 
of celebrating miners and teamsters. Pat only nodded. "Take one 
side of the street, and I'll take the other", he proposed. "If 
you spot Carmer give a yell before you move in".   Cobb's 
assent was tight. "You do the same. It's all I ask, Stevens".

Separating, they took different sides of the main drag and 
systematically combed the bars. Russ visited two places without result 
and his blood pressure was down to zero. Suddenly it seemed to him 
insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer so casually, even were 
he to prove the thief. He tramped out of the Miners Rest with his 
hopes plummeting, and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon, the 
last place of any consequence on this side of the street.   The 
Palace was an elaborate establishment, built practically on stilts in 
front, with long flights of wooden steps running up to the porch. Behind 
its ornate facade the notorious dive clung like a bird's nest 
to the rocky ribs of the canyonside. Russ ran up the steps quickly to 
the plank porch. The front windows of the place were long and narrow, 
reaching nearly to the floor and affording an unusually good view of 
the interior. Heading for the batwings, Cobb glanced perfunctorily 
through the nearest window, and suddenly dodged aside. Nerves tight as 
a bowstring, he paused to gather his wits.   Against all expectation, 
Carmer was inside, clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already 
so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything 
or anyone about him. Fierce anger surged through Russ. He fought 
down the impulse to rush in and collar the vicious puncher on the spot.

Reaching the porch rail beyond view of the bar windows, he 
feverishly scanned the busy street below. Stevens was nowhere in sight. 
Muffling an exclamation, Russ sprang to the nearest steps and ran 
down. As luck had it, he had not gone twenty feet in the street before 
Pat appeared.   "What luck, Cobb"? he said swiftly.

Russ pointed upward. "He's there", he got out tersely, 
curbing his rising excitement. Hitching his cartridge belt around, Pat 
glanced upward briefly at the Palace and started that way with Cobb 
at his side.   Climbing the steps steadily, they reached the 
top and headed for the door. Pat pushed through first. Forced behind 
him momentarily, Russ followed at once and halted two steps inside. 
His eyes widened. While five minutes ago the place had presented a scene 
of easy revelry, with Gyp Carmer a prominent figure, it was now 
as somnolent and dull as the day before payday. Carmer himself was nowhere 
to be seen.   A man knocked the roulette ball about idly 
in its track, and another dozed at one of the card tables. Two men murmured 
with their heads together at the end of the bar, while the sleek-headed 
bartender absently polished a glass. Looking the setup over, 
Stevens started coolly for the rear of the place.   "Where yuh 
goin'"?   It was the barkeep. Halting, Pat turned to 
survey him deliberately. He did not reply, going on toward the back. 
Less 
assured than the tall, wide-shouldered man in the lead, Cobb followed 
alertly, a hand on his gun butt. The bartender measured this situation 
with heavy eyes and decided he wanted no part of it. He said no 
more.   A hall opened in back of the bar, running toward an ell. 
Pat moved into it. Small rooms, probably for cards, opened off on 
either 
side. All the doors were open at this hour except one, and it was 
toward this that Stevens made his way with Russ close at his shoulder.

The door was locked. A single kick made it spring open, 
shuddering. Pat saw Gyp Carmer staggering forward, a half-filled bottle 
upraised 
as if to strike. Russ sprang through to bat it nimbly aside. 
With a bellow Carmer lunged at him. But he was more than half-drunk, 
and his faculties were dulled. Cobb unleashed a single powerful jab 
that sent Gyp reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan. 
He started to struggle up, heaving desperately. Russ gave him a brutal 
thrust that tumbled him over flat on his stomach. Kneeling, Cobb 
planted a sturdy knee in the small of his back, holding him pinned.

"Okay, Stevens. I've drawn his fangs", he snapped. "Go 
through his pockets, will you? If we have to we'll take him apart 
and see what he's made of"!   Complying methodically, 
Pat pulled pocket after pocket inside out without finding a thing. Cobb 
watched this with hunted eyes, his desperate hope waning by the moment. 
Stevens was grunting over the last empty pocket when Russ abruptly 
rose and lunged toward Carmer's hat, which had tumbled half-a-dozen 
feet away when he first fell. Cobb got it. Straightening up, his 
eyes ablaze, he held out the battered Stetson.   "Look at 
this"!   Inside the crown, stuffed behind the stained sweatband, 
could be seen thin, crumpled wads of currency. Carmer's ingenious 
cache for his loot had been found.

"By golly, Stevens! 
You were right", Russ exclaimed, tearing the loose bills out 
of Carmer's hat. "That is, if we can be sure this is Colcord's 
money"-   Pat grunted. "Where else would he get it? Count 
what you've got there, Cobb. We can soon tell".   Russ 
ran through the bills and named an amount it was highly unlikely any 
cowpuncher would come by honestly. Pat nodded. "It's within a 
hundred of what Crip had", he declared. "We know Penny spent some- 
and Carmer must have dropped a few dollars getting that load on".
