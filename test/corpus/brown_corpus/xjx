accuracy and authenticity of his informational sources. If he found data 
that fitted his general plan, he used it and counted his sources trustworthy. 
Conversely, if statistics were uncovered which contradicted 
a cherished theory, the sources were denounced as faulty. Such manipulations 
are frequently encountered in his essay on the suppression 
of the monasteries during the English reformation. Adams depended largely 
on the dispatches of foreign ambassadors and observers in England, 
claiming that the reports of such agents had to be accurate because 
there were no newspapers. This is certainly an irrational dogmatism, 
in which the modern mind attempts to understand the spirit of the sixteenth 
century on twentieth-century terms. Moreover, he rejects the 
contemporary accounts of Englishmen, casually adjudging them to be distorted 
by prejudice because "the opinions of Englishmen are of no 
great value". What is exposited by this observation is not the inherent 
prejudices of Englishmen but the Anglophobia of Brooks Adams.

In all fairness it must be admitted that Adams made no pretense 
at being an impartial historian. Impartiality to him meant an unwillingness 
to generalize and to search for a synthesis. He deplored the 
impact of German historiography on the writing of history, terming 
it a "dismal monster". Ranke and his disciples had reduced history 
to a profession of dullness; Brooks Adams preferred the chronicles 
of Froissart or the style and theorizing of Edward Gibbon, for 
at least they took a stand on the issues about which they wrote. He wrote 
eloquently to William James that impartial history was not only 
impossible but undesirable. If the historian was convinced of his own 
correctness, then he should not allow his vision to become fogged by 
disturbing facts. It was history that must be in error, not the historian. 
It was this basic trait that separated Adams from the ranks 
of professional historians and led him to commit time and time again what 
was his most serious offense against the historical method- namely, 
the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submitting 
it to the test of facts.   All of Adams' work reflects this 
dogmatic characteristic. No page seems to be complete without the statement 
of at least one unproved generalization. One example of this 
was his assertion that "**h all servile revolts must be dealt with by 
physical force". There is no explanation of terms nor a qualification 
that most such revolts have been dealt with by force- only a bald 
dogmatism that they must, because of some undefined compulsion, be 
so repelled. On matters of race he was similarly inflexible: "Most 
of the modern Latin races seem to have inherited **h the rigidity 
of the Roman mind". He cites the French Revolution as typifying 
this rigidity but makes no mention of the Italians, who have been able 
to 
adapt to all types of circumstances. He pontificates that "one 
of the first signs of advancing civilization is the fall in the value 
of women in men's eyes". It made no difference that most evidence 
points to an opposite conclusion. For Adams had made up his mind before 
all the facts were available.   All critics of Adams and 
his methods have observed this particular deficiency. J& T& Shotwell 
was appalled by such spurious history as that which attributed the 
fall of the Carolingian empire to the woolen trade, and he urged Adams 
to "transform his essay into a real history, embodying not merely 
those facts which fit into his theory, but also the modifications 
and exceptions". A& M& Wergeland called the Adams method literally 
antihistorical, while Clive Day maintained that the assumptions 
were not confined to theories alone but were also applicable to straight 
factual evidence. Moreover, stated Day, "He always omits 
facts which tend to disprove his hypothesis". Even D& A& Wasson, 
who compared <The Emancipation of Massachusetts> to the lifting 
of a fog from ancient landscapes, was also forced to admit the methodological 
deficiencies of the author.   In summary, Brooks Adams 
felt that the nature of history was order and that the order so discovered 
was as much subject to historical laws as the forces of nature. 
Moreover, he believed that most professional historians lacked some 
of the essential instruments for a proper study of history. However, 
despite the insight of many of his observations, his own conclusions 
are open to suspicion because of his failure to employ at all times the 
correct research methods. This should not prejudice an evaluation of 
his findings, but they were not the findings of a completely impartial 
investigator. What was perhaps more important than his concept of 
the nature of history and the historical method were those forces which 
shaped the direction of his thought. In the final analysis his contribution 
to American historiography was founded on almost intuitive insights 
into religion, economics, and Darwinism, the three factors which 
conditioned his search for a law of history. 

#RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERNATURALISM# 

Brooks Adams considered religion as an extremely significant 
manifestation of man's fear of the unknown. But it was nothing 
more than that. Religion and the churches were institutions which 
had been created by man, not God. He did not deny God; he simply 
did not believe that a Creator intervened or interfered in human 
affairs. The historian need not be concerned with the philosophical problems 
suggested by religion. There was no evidence, either of a positive 
or negative type, of the actions of a Divine Being in this world; 
and, since the historian should only be interested in strictly terrestrial 
activity, his research should eliminate the supernatural. Furthermore, 
he must regard religion as the expression of human forces. 
Certainly, he must recognize its power and attempt to ascertain its 
influence on the flow of history, but he must not confuse the natural 
and the mundane with the divine.   Adams was not breaking new ground 
when he claimed that the worship of an unseen power was in reality 
a reflection of man's inability to cope with his environment. Students 
of anthropology and comparative religion had long been aware that 
there was, indeed, a direct connection. But Adams was one of the first 
to suggest that this human incompetence was the only motivating factor 
behind religion. It was this fear which explained the development 
of a priestly caste whose function in society was to mollify and appease 
the angry deities. To keep themselves entrenched in power, the 
priests were forced to demonstrate their unique status through the miracle. 
It was the use of the supernatural that kept them in business. 
The German barbarians of the fourth century offered an excellent example:

"The Germans in the fourth century were a very simple 
race, who comprehended little of natural laws, and who therefore referred 
phenomena they did not understand to supernatural intervention. 
This intervention could only be controlled by priests, and thus the 
invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class. The 
power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the 
miracle, and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as 
did Elijah".   Adams contended that once such a special class 
had been created it became a vested interest and sought to maintain 
itself by assuming exclusive control over the relationships between 
God and man. Thus, the Church was born and because of its intrinsic 
character was soon identified as a conservative institution, determined 
to resist the forces of change, to identify itself with the political 
rulers, and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the masses. 
Doctrine was not only mysterious; it was also sacred, "and no 
believer in an inspired church could tolerate having her canons examined 
as we should examine human laws". These basic ideas concerning the 
nature of religion were, Adams believed, some of the major keys to 
the understanding of history and the movement of society. The dark views 
about the Puritans found in <The Emancipation of Massachusetts> 
were never altered.   Despite their adherence to the <status 
quo>, the forces of organized religion were compelled to make adjustments 
as increasing civilization augmented human knowledge. In <The 
Law of Civilization and Decay> Brooks Adams traced this evolution, 
always pointing to the fact that although the forms became more 
rational, the substance remained unchanged. The relic worship and monasticism 
of the Middle Ages were more advanced forms than were primitive 
fetish worship and nature myths. Yet, the idea imbedded in each 
was identical: to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that 
class which had been given special dominion over the secrets of God. 
To Adams that age in which religion exercised power over the entire 
culture of the race was one of imagination, and it is largely the 
admiration he so obviously held for such eras that betrays a peculiar 
religiosity- a sentiment he would have probably denied. 
Stephens had written his classic "incidents of travel" about these 
regions a hundred years before, and Catherwood, who had studied Piranesi 
in London and the great ruins of Egypt and Greece, had drawn 
the splendid illustrations that accompanied the text. Catherwood, an 
architect in New York, had been forgotten, like Stephens, and Victor 
reconstructed their lives as one reconstructs, for a museum, a dinosaur 
from two or three petrified bones. He had unearthed Stephens's 
letters in a New Jersey farmhouse and he discovered Stephens's 
unmarked grave in an old cemetery on the east side of New York, where 
the great traveller had been hastily buried during a cholera epidemic. 
Victor had been stirred by my account of him in <Makers and Finders,> 
for Stephens was one of the lost writers whom Melville had seen 
in his childhood and whom I was bent on resurrecting.   Victor 
had led an adventurous life. His <metier> was the American tropics, 
and he had lived all over Latin America and among the primitive 
tribes on the Amazon river. Well he knew the sleepless nights, the howling 
sore-ridden dogs and the biting insects in the villages of the 
Kofanes and Huitotoes. He had not yet undertaken the great exploit 
of his later years, the rediscovery of the ancient Inca highway, the 
route of Pizarro in Peru, but he had climbed to the original El Dorado, 
the Andean lake of Guatemala, and he had scaled the southern Sierra 
Nevada with its Tibetan-like people and looked into the emerald 
mines of Muzo. As a naturalist living for two years at the headwaters 
of the Amazon, he had collected specimens for Mexican museums, 
and he had taken to the London zoo a live quetzal, the sacred bird of 
the old Mayans. In fact, he had raised quetzal birds in his camp in 
the forest of Ecuador. Moreover, he had spent six months on the Galapagos 
islands, among the great turtles that Captain Cook had found 
there, and now and then he would disappear into some small island of 
the West Indies. Victor's book on John Lloyd Stephens was largely 
written in my study in the house at Weston.   I had had my 
name taken out of the telephone book, and this was partly because of 
a convict who had been discharged from Sing Sing and who called me night 
after night. He said he was a friend of Heywood Broun who had 
run a free employment bureau for several months during the depression, 
but the generous Broun to whom I wrote did not know his name and I 
somehow conceived the morbid notion that the man in question was prowling 
round the house. But one day came the voice of a man I had known 
when he was a boy, and I later remembered that this boy, thirty years 
before, had struck me as coming to no good. There had been something 
sinister about him that warned me against him,- I had never felt 
that way about any other boy,- but when he uttered his name on the 
telephone I had forgotten this and I was glad to do what he asked of 
me. He was a captain, he said, in the army, and on the train to New 
York his purse and all his money had been stolen, and would I lend 
him twenty-five dollars to be given him at the General Delivery window? 
Never hearing from him again, I remembered the little boy of whom 
I had had such doubts when he was ten years old. We lived for a 
while in a movie melodrama with a German cook and her son who turned 
out to be Nazis. Finally we got them out of the house, after the boy 
had run away four times looking for other Nazis, threatening to murder 
village schoolchildren and bragging that he was to be the next Fu^hrer. 
Then he began to have epileptic fits. We found that a charitable 
society in New York had a long case-history of the two; and 
they agreed to see that the tragic pair would not put poison in anybody 
else's soup.   To the Weston house came once William Allen 
Neilson, the president of Smith College who had been one of my old 
professors and who still called me "Boy" when I was sixty. It 
reminded me of my other professor, Edward Kennard Rand, of whom I 
had been so fond when I was at Harvard, the great mediaevalist and 
classical scholar who had asked me to call him "Ken", saying, "Age
