killable, digestible item, kept his eyes on the ring of anchored ships 
that lay off the shores in the bay, sheltered by the Jersey inlets. 
They often threw tidbits overboard. The larger ships were near Paulus 
Hook, already being called, by a few, Jersey City. These were 
the ships of His Majesty's Navy, herding the hulks of the East 
Indies merchants and the yachts and ketches of the loyalists. The 
news of battle on Breed's Hill had already seeped through, and New 
York itself was now left in the hands of the local Provincial Congress. 
The fish hawk, his wings not moving, circled and glided lower. 
The gilt sterns of the men-of-war becoming clearer to him, the sides 
of the wooden sea walls alternately painted yellow and black, the bronze 
cannon at the ports. The captain's gig of H&M&S& <Mercury> 
was being rowed to H&M&S& <Neptune>. ##

On shore 
"the freed slaves to despotism"- the town dwellers- watched 
the ships and waited. The <chevaux de frise>, those sharp stakes 
and barriers around the fort at the Battery, pointed to a conflict between 
the town and sea power rolling in glassy swells as the tide came 
in. Across the bay the Palisades were heavy in green timber; their 
rock paths led down to the Hudson. Below in the open bay facing Manhattan 
was Staten Island, gritty with clam shells and mud flats behind 
which nested farms, cattle barns, and berry thickets. Along Wappinger 
Creek in Dutchess County, past the white church at Fishkill, 
past Verplanck's Point on the east bank of the Hudson, to the white 
salt-crusted roads of the Long Island Rockaways there was a watching 
and an activity of preparing for something explosive to happen. 
Today, tomorrow, six months, even perhaps a year **h   The fish 
hawk flew on and was lost from sight. The British ships rolled at 
anchor, sent out picket boats and waited for orders from London. Waited 
for more ships, more lobster-backed infantry, and asked <what> 
was to be done with a war of rebellion? ##

David Cortlandt, having 
slept away a day and a night, came awake in a plank farmhouse on 
the Harlem River near Spuyten Duyvil. He looked out through windowpanes 
turned a faint violet by sun and weather, looked out at King's 
Bridge toward Westchester. The road seemed animated with a few more 
wagons than usual; a carriage raising up the choking June dust, 
and beyond, in a meadow, a local militia company drilling with muskets, 
Kentuck' rifles, every kind of horse pistol, old sword, or cutlass.

The wraith-like events of the last few days flooded David's 
mind and he rubbed his unshaved chin and felt again the ache in his 
kidneys caused by his saddle odyssey from Boston. Pensive, introspective, 
he ached. He had sent the dispatches downtown to the proper 
people and had slept. Now there was more to do. Orders not written down 
had to be transmitted to the local provincial government. He scratched 
his mosquito-plagued neck.   From the saddlebags, hung on 
a Hitchcock chair, David took out a good English razor, a present from 
John Hunter. He found tepid water in a pitcher and a last bit of 
soap, and he lathered his face and stood stropping the razor on his 
broad leather belt, its buckle held firm by a knob of the bedpost **h. 
He hoped he was free of self-deception.   Here he was, suddenly 
caught up in the delirium of a war, in the spite and calumny of Whigs 
and Tories. There would be great need soon for his skill as surgeon, 
but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge merely for war. 
David Cortlandt had certain psychic intuitions that this rebellion 
was not wholly what it appeared on the surface. He knew that many were 
using it for their own ends. But it did not matter. He stropped the 
razor slowly; what mattered was that a new concept of Americans was 
being born. That some men did not want it he could understand. The 
moral aridity of merchants made them loyal usually to their ledgers. 
Yet some, like Morris Manderscheid, would bankrupt themselves for 
the new ideas. Unique circumstances would test us all, he decided. Injury 
and ingratitude would occur. No doubt John Hancock would do well 
now; war was a smugglers' heaven. And what of that poor tarred 
and feathered wretch he had seen on the road driving down from Schuyler's? 
Things like that would increase rather than be done away 
with. One had to believe in final events or one was stranded in the abyss 
of nothing. He saw with John Hunter now that the perfectability 
of man was a dream. Life was a short play of tenebrous shadows. David 
began to shave with great sweeping strokes.   Time plays an 
essential part in our mortality, and suddenly for no reason he could imagine 
(or admit) the image of Peg laughing filled his mind- so desirable, 
so lusty, so full of nuances of pleasure and joy. He drove sensual 
patterns off, carefully shaving his long upper lip. It is harder, 
he muttered, to meditate on man (or woman) than on God.   David 
finished shaving, washed his face clean of lather, and combed and 
retied his hair. He was proud that he had never worn a wig. More and 
more of the colonials were wearing their own hair and not using powder. 
He felt cheerful again, refreshed; presentable in his wide-cut brown 
suit, the well-made riding boots.   It is so easy to falsify 
sentiment **h. In the meadow below, militia officers shouted at their 
men and on King's Bridge two boys sat fishing. The future would 
happen; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much. A man could 
be tossed outside the dimension of time by a stray bullet these days. 
He began to pack the saddlebags. <And all this too shall pass 
away:> it came to him out of some dim corner of memory from a church 
service when he was a boy- yes, in a white church with a thin spur 
steeple in the patriarchal Hudson Valley, where a feeling of plenitude 
was normal in those English-Dutch manors with their well-fed squires. 
Burly leathered men and wrinkled women in drab black rags carried on 
in a primitive way, almost unchanged from feudal times. Peasants puzzled 
Andrei. He wondered how they could go on in poverty, superstition, 
ignorance, with a complete lack of desire to make either their land 
or their lives flourish.   Andrei remembered a Bathyran meeting 
long ago. Tolek Alterman had returned from the colonies in Palestine 
and, before the national leadership, exalted the miracles of drying 
up swamps and irrigating the desert. A fund-raising drive to buy tractors 
and machinery was launched. Andrei remembered that his own reaction 
had been one of indifference.   Had he found the meaning too 
late? It aggravated him. The land of the Lublin Uplands was rich, 
but no one seemed to care. In the unfertile land in Palestine humans 
broke their backs pushing will power to the brink.   He had 
sat beside Alexander Brandel at the rostrum of a congress of Zionists. 
All of them were there in this loosely knit association of diversified 
ideologies, and each berated the other and beat his breast for 
his own approaches. When Alexander Brandel rose to speak, the hall 
became silent.   "I do not care if your beliefs take you along 
a path of religion or a path of labor or a path of activism. We are 
here because all our paths travel a blind course through a thick forest, 
seeking human dignity. Beyond the forest all our paths merge into 
a single great highway which ends in the barren, eroded hills of Judea. 
This is our singular goal. How we travel through the forest is for 
each man's conscience. Where we end our journey is always the same. 
We all seek the same thing through different ways- an end to this 
long night of two thousand years of darkness and unspeakable abuses 
which will continue to plague us until the Star of David flies over 
Zion". This was how Alexander Brandel expressed pure Zionism. 
It had sounded good to Andrei, but he did not believe it. In his 
heart he had no desire to go to Palestine. He loathed the idea of 
drying up swamps or the chills of malaria or of leaving his natural birthright.

Before he went into battle Andrei had told Alex, "I 
only want to be a Pole. Warsaw is my city, not Tel Aviv".

And now Andrei sat on a train on the way to Lublin and wondered 
if he was not being punished for his lack of belief. Warsaw! He 
saw the smug eyes of the Home Army chief, Roman, and all the 
Romans and 
the faces of the peasants who held only hatred for him. They had let 
this black hole of death in Warsaw's heart exist without a cry of 
protest.   Once there had been big glittering rooms where Ulanys 
bowed and kissed the ladies' hands as they flirted from behind their 
fans.   Warsaw! Warsaw!   "Miss Rak. I am a 
Jew".   Day by day, week by week, month by month, the betrayal 
gnawed at Andrei's heart. He ground his teeth together. I hate 
Warsaw, he said to himself. I hate Poland and all the goddamned mothers' 
sons of them. All of Poland is a coffin.   The terrible 
vision of the ghetto streets flooded his mind. What matters now? 
What is beyond this fog? Only Palestine, and I will never live to 
see Palestine because I did not believe.   By late afternoon 
the train inched into the marshaling yards in the railhead at Lublin, 
which was filled with lines of cars poised to pour the tools of war 
to the Russian front.   At a siding, another train which was a 
familiar sight these days. Deportees. Jews. Andrei's skilled eye 
sized them up. They were not Poles. He guessed by their appearance 
that they were Rumanians.   He walked toward the center of the 
city to keep his rendezvous with Styka. Of all the places in Poland, 
Andrei hated Lublin the most. The Bathyrans were all gone. Few 
of the native Jews who had lived in Lublin were still in the ghetto.

From the moment of the occupation Lublin became a focal point. 
He and Ana watched it carefully. Lublin generally was the forerunner 
of what would happen elsewhere. Early in 1939, Odilo Globocnik, 
the Gauleiter of Vienna, established ~SS headquarters for all 
of Poland. The Bathyrans ran a check on Globocnik and had only to 
conclude that he was in a tug of war with Hans Frank and the civilian 
administrators.   Globocnik built the Death's-Head Corps. 
Lublin was the seed of action for the "final solution" of the Jewish 
problem. As the messages from Himmler, Heydrich, and Eichmann 
came in through Alfred Funk, Lublin's fountainhead spouted.

A bevy of interlacing lagers, work camps, concentration camps erupted 
in the area. Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war disappeared 
into Lublin's web. Plans went in and out of Lublin, indicating 
German confusion. A tale of a massive reservation in the Uplands to 
hold several million Jews **h A tale of a plan to ship all Jews to 
the island of Madagascar **h Stories of the depravity of the guards 
at Globocnik's camps struck a chord of terror at the mere mention 
of their names. Lipowa 7, Sobibor, Chelmno, Poltawa, Belzec, Krzywy-Rog, 
Budzyn, Krasnik. Ice baths, electric shocks, lashings, wild 
dogs, testicle crushers.   The Death's-Head Corps took in 
Ukrainian and Baltic Auxiliaries, and the <Einsatzkommandos> waded 
knee-deep in blood and turned into drunken, dope-ridden maniacs. 
Lublin was their heart.   In the spring of 1942 Operation Reinhard 
began in Lublin. The ghetto, a miniature of Warsaw's, was emptied 
into the camp in the Majdan-Tartarski suburb called Majdanek. 
As the camp emptied, it was refilled by a draining of the camps and 
towns around Lublin, then by deportees from outside Poland. In and 
in and in they poured through the gates of Majdanek, but they never 
left, and Majdanek was not growing any larger.   What was happening 
in Majdanek? Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern for the 
daily trains now leaving the Umschlagplatz in Warsaw? Was there 
another Majdanek in the Warsaw area, as they suspected?   Andrei 
stopped at Litowski Place and looked around quickly at the boundary 
of civil buildings. His watch told him he was still early. Down 
the boulevard he could see a portion of the ghetto wall. He found an 
empty bench, opened a newspaper, and stretched his legs before him. 
Krakow Boulevard was filled with black Nazi uniforms and the dirty 
brownish ones of their Auxiliaries.   "Captain 
Androfski"!

Andrei glanced up over the top of the paper and looked into the 
mustached, homely face of Sergeant Styka. Styka sat beside him and 
pumped his hand excitedly. "I have been waiting across the street 
at the post office since dawn. I thought you might get in on a morning 
train".   "It's good to see you again, Styka".
