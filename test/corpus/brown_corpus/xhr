still happen before a wing of ~B-52 bombers could drop their ~H-bombs.

In a word, plenty. The key man almost certainly would 
be Col& William W& Wisman, ~SAC's senior controller. He 
or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, all full colonels, 
mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day. It is a quiet 
but impressive room- 140 feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, twenty-one 
feet high. Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts 
are crammed with intelligence information. And Bill Wisman, forty-three, 
a farmer's son from Beallsville, Ohio, is a quiet but impressive 
man. His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown. His movements 
and speech are precise, clear and quick. No question ruffles him 
or causes him to hesitate.   Wisman, who has had the chief controller's 
job for four years, calls the signals for a team operating 
three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights, switches and buttons. 
At least a dozen men, some armed, are never far away from him. 
In front of him is a gold phone. In emergencies the ~SAC commander, 
Gen& Thomas Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy 
a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman 
and his staff. At General Power's seat in the balcony there is 
also a gold phone. General Power would participate in the decision 
making. Wisman, below, would listen in and act. His consoles can give 
him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and 
with every ~SAC aircraft.   He need only pick up one of 
the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the 
big red button marked ALERT. (There are two receivers in case 
one should be dropped and damaged.)   But Wisman, too, does not 
know the go code. He must take it from "the red box". In point 
of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half 
feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to 
Wisman's right. The box is internally wired so the door can never 
be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ("It's real obnoxious").

Now we must become vague, for we are approaching 
one of the nation's most guarded secrets. The codes in the red box- 
there are several of them covering various contingencies- are contained 
in a sealed ~X-ray-proof "unique device". They are supplied, 
a batch at a time, by a secret source and are continually changed 
by Wisman or his staff, at random intervals.   But even the contents 
of Wisman's box cannot start a war. They are mere fragments, 
just one portion of preprepared messages. What these fragments are 
and how they activate the go order may not be revealed. The pieces must 
be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff. 
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures 
which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special 
codes, each message also contains an "internal authenticator", 
another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting 
the real thing.   I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke 
out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one. "I'd wind 
up full of .38 bullet holes", he said, and there was no question that 
he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.   Now let 
us imagine a wing of ~B-52's, on alert near their "positive control 
(or fail-safe) points", the spots on the map, many miles from 
Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific 
orders to proceed to their targets. They, too, have fragments of 
the go code with them. As Wisman put it, "They have separate pieces 
of the pie, and we have the whole pie. Once we send out the whole 
pie, they can put their pieces into it. Unless we send out the whole 
pie, their pieces mean nothing". Why does Wisman's ever-changing 
code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers? 
The answer is a cryptographic secret. At any rate, three 
men out of a six-man ~B-52 crew are required to copy down Wisman's 
go-to-war message. Each must match Wisman's "pie" with the 
fragment that he carries with him. All three must compare notes and agree 
to "go". ##

After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated 
work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum 
of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each 
with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released. 
Unless all gadgets are properly operated- and the wires and seals 
from the handles removed first- no damage can be done.

Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the game ended. They 
went as rigid as black statuary **h six figures, lean and tall and 
angular, went still. Their heads were in the air sniffing. They all 
swung at the same instant in the same direction. They saw it before 
I did, even with my binoculars. It was nothing more than a tiny distant 
rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds 
to the earth. In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree, 
no more. A white man would not have seen it. The aborigines fastened 
upon it with a concentration beyond pathos. Watching, they waited 
until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant 
across the dry burning land. At once the whole band set off at a lope. 
They were chasing a rain cloud.   They went after the squall 
as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow. I followed them 
in the jeep and now they did not care. The games were over, this 
was life. Occasionally, for no reason that I could see, they would suddenly 
alter the angle of their trot. Sometimes I guessed it was because 
the rain squall had changed direction. Sometimes it was to skirt 
a gulley. Their gait is impossible to convey in words. It has nothing 
of the proud stride of the trained runner about it, it is not a lope, 
it is not done with style or verve. It is the gait of the human who 
must run to live: arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground, 
head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target, 
a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully 
graceful. It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.

They ran for three hours. Finally, avoiding hummocks and seeking low 
ground, they intercepted the rain squall. For ten minutes they ran 
beneath the squall, raising their arms and, for the first time, shouting 
and capering. Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady. 
They were studying the ground. Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a 
few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground. He had found 
a depression with rain water in it. He bent down, a black cranelike figure, 
and put his mouth to the ground.   With a lordly and generous 
gesture, 
the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows. The 
other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle. In an instant 
he had sucked it dry.   The aborigine lives on the cruelest land 
I have ever seen. Which does not mean that it is ugly. Part of it 
is, of course. There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which 
are hideous. They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so 
many centuries that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges 
fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty 
feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand. 
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality. But much of the land 
which the aborigine wanders <looks> as if it should be hospitable. 
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has a peaceful quality, 
the hills roll softly.   The malignancy of such a landscape 
has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean. He 
tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock, 
a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer. They went well-equipped 
with everything except knowledge of the "outback" country. "

The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle 
slopes and soft gray tree-clumps. Nothing appalling or horrible rushed 
upon these men. Only there happened- nothing. There might have 
been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps: only- 
there was not. It might have rained, any time; only- it did not. 
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise; 
only- there was not. They lay, with the birds hopping from branch 
to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them. No one 
came".   The white men died. And countless others like them have 
died. Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of 
men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly 
lost direction, were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant 
and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally died.

The aborigine is not deceived; he knows that the land is hard 
and pitiless. He knows that the economy of life in the "outback" 
is awful. There is no room for error or waste. Any organism that falters 
or misperceives the signals or weakens is done. I do not know 
if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge, but 
I suspect that it can. Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his 
odd air of dignity. 

#THE FAMILY AT THE BOULDER#

SEEING an aborigine 
today is a difficult thing. Many of them have drifted into the 
cities and towns and seaports. Others are confined to vast reservations, 
and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish 
them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they 
are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for <corroborees> 
at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch- 
which is very low indeed.   I persuaded an Australian friend 
who had lived "outback" for years to take me to see some aborigines 
living in the bush. It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation, 
even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge 
of the aborigines and their language. Finally, however, the arrangements 
were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover. We 
followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a 
smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth. 
The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big 
red boulder, swung off the road. At once he started to glance toward 
the instrument panel. It took me a moment to realize what was odd 
about that panel: there was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked 
gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about. The rancher 
was navigating his way across the flatland.   "Do you always 
navigate like this"? I asked.   "Damned right", he 
said. "Once I get out on the flat I do. Some chaps that know an 
area well can make their way by landmarks **h a tree here, a wash here, 
a boulder there. But if you don't know the place like the palm of 
your hand, you'd better use a compass and the speedometer. Two miles 
northeast, then five miles southwest **h that sort of thing. Very 
simple".   He was right. The landscape kept repeating itself. 
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was 
hopeless. Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines. They 
were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder: a man, his lubra, 
and two children. The sun was not yet high and all of them were in 
the small area 
of shade cast by the boulder.   There was also a dog, 
a dingo dog. Its ribs showed, it was a yellow nondescript color, 
it suffered from a variety of sores, hair had scabbed off its body in 
patches. It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving, 
watching us carefully. It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished 
dog. No one patted the dog. It was not a pet. It was a worker.

"The buggers love shade", the rancher said. "I suppose 
because it saves them some loss of body water. They'll move around 
that rock all day, following the shade. During the hottest part of 
the day, of course, the sun comes straight down and there isn't any 
shade".   We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land Rover, 
and walked over toward the family.   The man was leaning against 
the rock. He gazed away from us as we approached. He was over 
six feet tall and very thin. His legs were narrow and very long. Every 
bone and muscle in his body showed, but he did not give the appearance 
of starving. He had long black hair and a wispy beard. The ridges 
over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut. There was something
