walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through 
the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project.

The esplanade eliminates Grovers ave&, which on original 
plans ran through the center of the development. The esplanade would 
feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project. 

_KANSAS CITY, MO&, FEB& 9 (~UPI)_- The president of the 
Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters 
was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left 
home for work.   Battalion Chief Stanton M& Gladden, 42, 
the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters 
association and the teamsters union, suffered multiple fractures 
of both ankles. He was in Baptist Memorial hospital. 

#IGNITION SETS 
OFF BLAST#

The battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 
1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that 
he could take his other car to work.   "I'd just turned on 
the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway", 
he said.   Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John, 
17, and Jim, 13, were inside the house. The younger boy said the blast 
knocked him out of bed and against the wall. 

#HOOD FLIES OVER HOUSE# 

The explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of 
the house. The left front wheel landed 100 feet away.   Police 
laboratory technicians said the explosive device, containing either ~TNT 
or nitroglycerine, was apparently placed under the left front 
wheel. It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter.

Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls 
in recent months and reportedly received one last night.   The 
fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving 
top personnel and the fight 
between the fire fighters association and the 
teamsters union. 

#LED FIGHT ON TEAMSTERS#

Gladden has been an 
outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's 
battle against the teamsters, which began organizing city firemen 
in 1959.   The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward 
for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible 
for the bombing. A $500 reward was offered by the association's 
local in Kansas City, Kas&.   The association said 
it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James 
Mining and Eugene Shiflett. Mining is secretary-treasurer of the 
local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee. Both have 
been active in the association. 

_ANKARA, TURKEY, OCT& 24 (~AP)_- Turkish political leaders 
bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national 
front government with Gen& Cemal Gursel as president. 
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive 
elections on Oct& 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political 
bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat.   By-passing 
the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow 
of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago, the army general staff, 
led by Gen& Cedvet Sunay, had set a deadline for the parties to 
join in a national coalition government.   The army leaders threatened 
to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign 
an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen& Gursel as president. Gen& 
Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months. 
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes 
in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime 
now in prison would be pardoned.   Party leaders came out of 
the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement 
had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections 
which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its 
own.

Vincent G& Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant 
district attorney, it was announced Monday by Charles E& Raymond, 
District Attorney.   Ierulli will replace Desmond D& Connall 
who has been called to active military service but is expected back 
on the job by March 31.   Ierulli, 29, has been practicing 
in Portland since November, 1959. He is a graduate of Portland University 
and the Northwestern College of Law. He is married and the 
father of three children.

Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure 
is more important than aiding them economically, E& M& Martin, 
assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the 
World Affairs Council Monday night.   Martin, who has been 
in office in Washington, D& C&, for 13 months spoke at the 
council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel. He told some 350 
persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build 
their own societies their own ways, following their own paths.

"We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which, if not identical, 
is congenial with ours", he said but adding that if they do 
not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality 
and loyalty. 

#PATIENCE NEEDED#

Insuring that the countries 
have a freedom of choice, he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet 
Union.   He cited East Germany where after 15 years of 
Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people 
in, and added, "so long as people rebel, we must not give up".

Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.   "The 
countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we 
took a century to build", he said.   By leaving our doors open 
the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and 
to compare, he said. 

#INDIVIDUAL HELP BEST#

"We have no reason 
to fear failure, but we must be extraordinarily patient", the assistant 
secretary said.   Economically, Martin said, the United 
States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves. 
Private business is more effective than government aid, he explained, 
because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.

The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of 
the country, at what he termed a "social cost".   Martin said 
the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary 
products which may involve the total income of one country.

The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive 
stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense 
more plans for the city's schools in event of attack. 
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board 
should go, and whose advice it should follow.   The board members, 
after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs& Ralph H& 
Molvar, 1409 ~SW Maplecrest Dr&, said they thought they had already 
been cooperating.   Chairman C& Richard Mears pointed 
out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem, in case 
of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate so far as possible 
to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.

Dr& Melvin W& Barnes, 
superintendent, said he thought the schools 
were waiting for some leadership, perhaps on the national level, 
to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would "be more 
fruitful", and that he had found that other school districts were 
not as far along in their planning as this district.   "Los Angeles 
has said they would send the children to their homes in case of 
disaster", he said. "Nobody really expects to evacuate. I think 
everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national 
level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence 
in following.   Mrs& Molvar, who kept reiterating her request 
that they "please take a stand", said, "We must have faith 
in somebody- on the local level, and it wouldn't be possible for 
everyone to rush to a school to get their children".   Dr& 
Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans, even 
for a high school where there were lots of cars "might not be realistic 
and would not work".   Mrs& Molvar asked again that 
the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program. 
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far 
and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.

It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board 
should be informed on what was done, is going to be done and what 
it thought should be done. 

_SALEM (~AP)_- The statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday 
in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov& Mark Hatfield.   Hatfield 
also is scheduled to hold a public United Nations Day reception 
in the state capitol on Tuesday.   His schedule calls for 
a noon speech Monday in Eugene at the Emerald Empire Kiwanis Club.

He will speak to Willamette University Young Republicans 
Thursday night in Salem.   On Friday he will go to Portland 
for the swearing in of Dean Bryson as Multnomah County Circuit 
Judge.   He will attend a meeting of the Republican State Central 
Committee Saturday in Portland and see the Washington-Oregon 
football game.

Beaverton School District No& 48 board members examined blueprints 
and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a 
Monday night workshop session.   A bond issue which would have 
provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools 
was defeated by district voters in January.   Last week the 
board, by a 4 
to 3 vote, decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 
6-3-3 (junior high school) system or the 8-4 system. Board members 
indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be 
taken on Nov& 15, the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the 
construction of three new elementary schools.

Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg will speak Sunday night 
at the Masonic Temple at a $25-a-plate dinner honoring Sen& Wayne 
L& Morse, ~D-Ore&.   The dinner is sponsored by organized 
labor and is scheduled for 7 p&m&.   Secretary Goldberg 
and Sen& Morse will hold a joint press conference at the Roosevelt 
Hotel at 4:30 p&m& Sunday, Blaine Whipple, executive secretary 
of the Democratic Party of Oregon, reported Tuesday.

Other speakers for the fund-raising dinner include Reps& Edith 
Green and Al Ullman, Labor Commissioner Norman Nilsen and Mayor 
Terry Schrunk, all Democrats.
