and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following 
meeting. 

#CITES DISCREPANCIES#

Mrs& Williams had a list which 
she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory 
of Dr& Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for 
the board's approval.   "I hate to have these things come 
up again and again", Dr& Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion. 
"These are the board's minutes. I'll write what you tell 
me to".   For a number of years the board used a machine to 
keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.

It was about that time, a board member said later, that Dr& 
Thomas G& Pullen, Jr&, 
State superintendent of schools, told 
Dr& Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would 
not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him.

The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary Commission, 
the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies 
use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law 
suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their 
meetings.   Dr& Jenkins notes, however, that most of the 
school boards in the State do not do so.

State Senator Joseph A& Bertorelli (D&, First Baltimore) 
had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block 
of West Pratt street.   He was taken to University Hospital 
in a municipal ambulance.   Doctors at the hospital said he was 
partially paralyzed on the right side. His condition was said to be, 
"fair".   Police said he became ill while parked in front of 
a barber shop at 229 West Pratt street. 

#BARBER SUMMONED#

He called 
Vincent L& Piraro, proprietor of the shop, who summoned police 
and an ambulance.

The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday 
that there are "deficiencies" in the city's snow clearing program 
which should be corrected as soon as possible.   Councilman William 
D& Schaefer (D&, Fifth) said in a letter to Mayor Grady 
that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms 
and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month. 

#WERNER 
CRITICIZED#

Conceding that several cities to the north were 
in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr& Schaefer 
listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here.

He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December. 
Equipment should be in operation "almost immediately after the 
first snowfall", Mr& Schaefer said.   The Councilman, 
who is the Administration floor leader, also criticized Bernard L& 
Werner, public works director, for "halting snow operations" on 
Tuesday night after the Sunday storm. 

#SENT HOME FOR REST#

Mr& 
Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week. 
What he did, Mr& Werner said, was let manual laborers go home Tuesday 
night for some rest. Work resumed Wednesday, he said. 
Mr& Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan, 
under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to 
use snow tires or chains on them, should be "strictly enforced".

Admitting that main streets and the central business district 
should have priority, the Councilman said it is also essential that 
small shopping areas "not be overlooked **h if our small merchants are 
to survive".   Recounting personal observations of clearance 
work, the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment 
or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be 
set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually 
freezes. 

_ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7 (SPECIAL)_- The 15-year-old adopted son of 
a Washington attorney and his wife, who were murdered early today in 
their Chesapeake Bay-front home, has been sent to Spring Grove State 
Hospital for detention.   The victims were H& Malone Dresbach, 
47, and his wife, Shirley, 46. Each had been shot in the back 
several times with a .22-caliber automatic rifle, according to Capt& 
Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.   Judge 
Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital 
because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel 
County Jail. The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have 
a hearing in Juvenile Court.   

#YOUNGER SON CALLS POLICE# 

Soon after 10 A&M&, when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick 
home 
in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles south of here on the bay, in 
response to a call from the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they 
found Mrs& Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor. Her 
husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.   The younger 
son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings 
and had driven away in their mother's car.   The description 
of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland 
on police radio. 

#TWO BROTHERS ADOPTED#

Police said the boys 
are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.

Trooper J& A& Grzesiak spotted the wanted car, 
with 
three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside Annapolis. The 
driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken 
to the Edgewater Station, police said. 

_ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L& 
Simpkins, his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary 
of State.   Mr& Simpkins will move into the post being vacated 
by Thomas B& Finan, earlier named attorney general to succeed 
C& Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated to an associate judgeship 
on the Maryland Court of Appeals.   Governor Tawes announced 
that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office 
next Friday. 

#SIMPKINS FROM SOMERSET#

Mr& Simpkins is a resident 
of Somerset county, and he and the Governor, also a Somerset countian, 
have been friends since Mr& Simpkins was a child.   Now 
38, Mr& Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's 
College of Agriculture in 1947.   Five years later, he 
was awarded the university's degree in law.   Mr& Simpkins 
made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 
1951 through 1958. From the outset of his first term, he established 
himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.

MARYLAND contracts for future construction during October 
totaled $77,389,000, up to 10 per cent compared to October, 1960, F& 
W& Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.   Dodge reported 
the following breakdown:   Nonresidential at $20,447,000, down 
28 per cent; residential at $47,101,000, up 100 per cent; and 
heavy engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.   The cumulative 
total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted 
to $634,517,000, a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding 
period of last year.   A breakdown of the ten-month total 
showed:   Nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent; residential 
at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent; and heavy engineering at 
$102,285,000, down 33 per cent.   Residential building consists 
of houses, apartments, hotels, dormitories and other buildings designed 
for shelter.

The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments, which 
began about six years ago, has more than tripled within that span of 
time.   In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings 
will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction.

While availability of mortgage money has been a factor 
in encouraging apartment construction, the generally high level of 
prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among 
the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the 
apartment-building 
field.   Although economic and personal circumstances 
vary widely among those now choosing apartments, Leo J& Pantas, 
vice president of a hardware manufacturing company, pointed out recently 
that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common: 
a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems 
involved in maintaining a house. 

#CONVENIENCE HELD KEY#

"Convenience 
is therefore the key to the housing market today. Trouble-free, 
long-life, quality components will play an increasingly important 
part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960", Pantas 
predicted.

SIXTY-SEVEN living units are being added to the 165-unit 
Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section.   Ultimately 
the development will comprise 300 units, in two-story and three-story 
structures. Various of the apartments are of the terrace type, being 
on the ground floor so that entrance is direct. Others, which are 
reached by walking up a single flight of stairs, have balconies.

The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction. 
Heating is by individual gas-fired, forced warm air systems.

CONSTRUCTION in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of 
the gross national product, according to a study by Johns-Manville 
Corporation. 

_LONDON, FEB& 9_- Vital secrets of Britain's first atomic 
submarine, the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire United 
States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet, were stolen by a 
London-based soviet spy ring, secret service agents testified today.

The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United 
States in 1959 and was launched last year. It is a killer sub- that 
is, a hunter of enemy subs. It has a hull patterned on that of the
