anatomy in dogs and cats, and he has been criticized for using pathologic 
human material in his normal study (Loosli, '38). Although Miller 
noted in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply existed 
between animals, nowhere in his published works is it found that he 
did a comparative study of the intrapulmonary features of various mammalian 
lungs other than in the dog and cat (Miller, '13; '25).

The meaning of this variation in distribution of the bronchial 
artery as found in the horse is not clear. However, this artery is known 
to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal 
airways and supportive tissues of the lung. The alveoli and respiratory 
bronchioles are primarily diffusing tissues. Theoretically, they 
are capable of extracting their required oxygen either from the surrounding 
air (Ghoreyeb and Karsner, '13) or from pulmonary arterial 
blood (Comroe, '58). Therefore, an explanation of this alveolar 
bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increased 
amount of supportive tissue, not primarily diffusing in nature, 
in the region of the alveolus. If this be true, the possibility exists 
that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial arteries might cause widespread 
degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that seen in generalized 
emphysema. One would not expect such an event to occur in animals 
possessing lungs of types /1, or /2,.   The presence of normally 
occurring bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses was first 
noted in 1721 by Ruysch, and thereafter by many others. Nakamura 
('58), Verloop ('48), Marchand, Gilroy and Watson ('50), von 
Hayek ('53), and Tobin ('52) have all claimed their normal but 
relatively nonfunctional existence in the human being. Miller ('50) 
is the principal antagonist of this viewpoint. In criticism of the latter's 
views, his conclusions were based upon dog lung injection studies 
in which all of the vascular channels were first filled with a solution 
under pressure and then were injected with various sized colored 
particles designed to stop at the arteriolar level. As early as 1913 
Ghoreyeb and Karsner demonstrated with perfusion studies in dogs 
that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level 
when pressure was maintained in the pulmonary artery and vein, but that 
increases in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative 
drop in pulmonary artery pressure. Berry, Brailsford and Daly 
in 1931 and Nakamura in 1958 reaffirmed this. Our own studies in which 
bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomoses were demonstrated, 
were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery first with no pressure 
on the pulmonary artery or vein, and then by injecting the pulmonary 
artery and vein afterwards. It is distinctly possible, therefore, 
that simultaneous pressures in all three vessels would have rendered 
the shunts inoperable and hence, uninjectable. This viewpoint is further 
supported by Verloop's ('48) demonstration of thickened bronchial 
artery and arteriolar muscular coats which are capable of acting 
as valves. In other words, the anastomoses between the bronchial artery 
and pulmonary artery should be considered as <functional> or <demand> 
shunts.   In addition, little work has been done on a comparative 
basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary 
artery anastomoses. Verloop ('48; '49) found these shunts 
in the human being but was unable to find them in rats. Ellis, Grindlay 
and Edwards ('52) also were unable to find them in rats. Nakamura 
('58) was unable to demonstrate their existence, either by anatomic 
or physiologic methods, in dogs. The possibility that the absence 
or presence of these shunts is species-dependent is therefore inferred. 
Certainly, the mere fact of failing to demonstrate them in one 
or another species does not conclusively deny their existence in that 
species. It is, however, highly suggestive and agrees well with our own 
findings in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring 
bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunts in certain species, especially 
the dog.   In conclusion, these findings suggest the need for 
a comparative physiology, pathology, and histology of mammalian lungs. 
In addition, a detailed interspecies survey of the incidence of generalized 
pulmonary emphysema in mammals would be interesting and pertinent. 
Also, for the present, great caution should be exercised in the 
choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary studies if they are to 
be applied to man. This is especially so if the dog, cat or monkey are 
to be used, in view of their marked anatomical differences from man. 
Finally, it is suggested that in many respects the horse lung may be 
anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently 
known species. 

#SUMMARY#

The main subgross anatomical features 
of the lungs of various mammals are presented. A tabulation of these 
features permits the lungs to be grouped into three distinctive subgross 
types. Type /1, is represented by the cow, sheep, and pig; 
type /2,, by the dog, cat, and monkey; type /3,, by the horse. 
Lobularity is extremely well developed in type /1,; absent in type 
/2,; imperfectly developed in type /3,. The pleura and interlobular 
septa are thick in types /1, and /3,. The pleura is extremely 
thin in type /2, and septa are absent. Arterial supply to the pleura 
in types /1, and /3, is provided by the bronchial artery, and 
in type /2,, by the pulmonary artery. In types /1,, /2, and /3, 
the bronchial artery terminates in a capillary bed shared in common 
with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole. In 
type /3, the bronchial artery also provides blood directly to the 
alveolar capillary bed. True terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent 
form taken by the distal airways in types /1, and /3,, although 
small numbers of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles are present. 
Well developed respiratory bronchioles, on the other hand, appear 
to be the only form taken by the distal airways in type /2,. In 
type /1, the pulmonary vein closely follows the course of the bronchus 
and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum. This maybe 
due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barriers present. In 
type /3, this general relationship is maintained peripherally but 
not centrally where the pulmonary vein follows a more independent path 
to the hilum as is the case throughout the lung in type /2,.

Some of the features of the top portions of Figure 1 and Figure 
2 were mentioned in discussing Table 1. First, the Onset Profile 
spreads across approximately 12 years for boys and 10 years for girls. 
In contrast, 20 of the 21 lines in the Completion Profile (excluding 
center 5 for boys and 4 for girls) are bunched and extend over a 
much shorter period, approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for 
girls. The Maturity Chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that 
Onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas Completion 
is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence. Second, for 
both sexes, the 21 transverse lines in the Onset Profile vary more 
in individual spread than those in the Completion Profile. Although 
the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines are based 
are <relatively> larger for those centers which begin to ossify early 
(Table 1), there are considerable differences in this value between 
centers having the closely timed Onsets. Third, the process of calcification 
is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these 
boys than for the girls, a fact which confirms data for other groups of 
children.   The Onset Profile and Completion Profile are constructed 
to serve as norms for children. It is convenient to classify 
a child's onset ages and completion ages as "advanced", "moderate" 
(modal), or "delayed" according to whether the child's 
age equivalent "dots" appeared to the <left> of, <upon>, or 
to the <right> of the appropriate short transverse line. When a dot 
appears close to the end of the transverse line, the "moderate" 
rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot 
with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age. Such classifications 
may be called "somewhat advanced" or "somewhat delayed", 
as the case may be, reserving "moderate" for dots upon or close 
to the mean.   In the lower portion of each Chart, the Skeletal 
Age (Hand) of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified. 
There the middle one of the three curves denotes "mean Skeletal Age" 
for the Maturity Series boys and girls. The upper curve denotes 
the mean plus one standard deviation, and the lower curve represents 
the mean minus one standard deviation. Thus, a child's Skeletal 
Age "dots" may be classified as "advanced" when they appear above 
the middle curve, "moderate" when they appear immediately above 
or below the middle curve, and "delayed" when they appear below 
the lower curve.   To summarize the purpose of the Skeletal Maturity 
Chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which 
show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level 
of growth centers. First, the upper portion requires series of films 
for every child, consisting of those from Hand, Elbow, Shoulder, Knee, 
and Foot. The lower portion necessitates only films of Hand. 
Second, the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an 
equal number of growth centers from the long, short, and round bones 
of the five regions. The lower portion permits comparison of maturity 
levels of short and round bones predominantly, since only two long bones 
are included in Hand and Wrist as a region. Third, the upper portion 
deals with only two indicators of developmental level, Onset and 
Completion. The lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate 
maturity indicators of each Hand center as well as their Onset 
and Completion. Fourth, the two indicators are for the most part 
widely separated chronologically, with the extensive age gap occurring 
during childhood for all but one growth center. The lower portion provides 
a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood.   Onsets, 
Completions, and Skeletal Ages (Hand) of boy 34 and girl 2 
may be directly compared and classified, using only those Skeletal Ages 
which appear immediately below the Onset Profile and the Completion 
Profile. It may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection 
of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small, 
according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for 
centers throughout the body. Accordingly, maturity level ratings by 
means of the upper portion and lower portion of the Chart, respectively, 
should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age assessments are dependent 
upon Onsets during infancy and upon Completions during adolescence. 
It is clear that there are some differences in the ratings, but 
there is substantial agreement. Since a Skeletal Age rating can 
be made at any age during growth, from Elbow, Shoulder, Knee, or Foot 
as well as Hand, it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes 
to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood. 
As stated earlier in the paper, Onsets and Completions- 
particularly the former- provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy 
in osseous development, each within a limited age period. Such 
an indicator, or indicators, are needed as means of recognizing specific 
periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress.   It 
was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis 
of variability of Onset and Completion in each of the 21 growth 
centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in Tables 1 and 
2. As one approach to doing this, Figures 3 and 4 have been constructed 
from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for 
boy 34 and girl 2. The differences between onset age and completion age 
with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition 
by means of a series of arrows. The data for boy 34 appear 
in Figure 3, and for girl 2 in Figure 4. The numbering system used 
in Tables 1 and 2 and Figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth 
centers.   The "dot" on one end of each arrow indicates 
extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the 
corresponding mean age for the growth center. The "tip" of the 
arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion 
age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center. Thus, the 
alignment of the "dots" and "tips", respectively, indicate individual 
variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect 
to the mean values for these boys and girls. The direction in which 
the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was 
changed at Completion from the level at Onset. When the "dot" 
and "tip" coincide, the classification used in this paper is "same 
schedule". The length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or 
acceleration at Completion over that at Onset, and the difference 
in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale
