Mercer is supposed to have refused it with, "Anyone who wears 
a square monacle must be affected"!   Everett Miller, then 
assistant director for the <Garrick Gaieties>, a Theatre Guild 
production, needed a lyricist for a song he had written; he just 
happened not to need any actor at the moment, however. For him Mercer 
produced the lyric to "Out of Breath Scared to Death of You", 
introduced in that most successful of all the <Gaieties>, by Sterling 
Holloway. This 1930 edition also had songs in it by Vernon Duke 
and Ira Gershwin, by E& Y& Harburg and Duke, and by Harry 
Myers. Entrance into such stellar song writing company encouraged 
the burgeoning song writer to take a wife, Elizabeth Meehan, a dancer 
in the <Gaieties>. The Mercers took up residence in Brooklyn, 
and Mercer found a regular job in Wall Street "misplacing stocks 
and bonds".   When he heard that Paul Whiteman was looking 
for singers to replace the Rhythm Boys, Mercer applied and got the 
job, "not for my voice, I'm sure, but because I could write songs 
and material generally". While with the Whiteman band Mercer met 
Jerry Arlen. He had yet to meet Harold Arlen, for although they 
had "collaborated" on "Satan's Li'l Lamb", Mercer and 
Harburg had worked from a lead sheet the composer had furnished them. 
The lyric, Mercer remembers, was tailored to fit the unusual melody.

Mercer's Whiteman association brought him into contact 
with 
Hoagy Carmichael, whose "Snowball" Mercer relyriced as "Lazybones", 
in which form it became a hit and marked the real beginning 
of Mercer's song-writing career. After leaving Whiteman, Mercer 
joined the Benny Goodman band as a vocalist. With the help of Ziggy 
Elman, also in the band, he transformed a traditional Jewish melody 
into a popular song, "And the Angels Sing". The countrywide 
success of "Lazybones" and "And the Angels Sing" could only 
lead to Hollywood, where, besides Harold Arlen, Mercer collaborated 
with Harry Warren, Jimmy Van Heusen, Richard Whiting, Walter 
Donaldson, Jerome Kern, and Arthur Schwartz. Mercer has also 
written both music and lyrics for several songs. He may be the only 
song writer ever to have collaborated with a secretary of the U& S& 
Treasury; he collaborated on a song with William Hartman Woodin, 
who was Secretary of the Treasury, 1932-33.   When Johnny 
Mercer and Harold Arlen began their collaboration in 1940, Mercer, 
like Arlen, had several substantial film songs to his credit, among 
them "Hooray for Hollywood", "Ride, Tenderfoot, Ride", 
"Have You Got Any Castles, Baby?", and "Too Marvelous 
for Words" (all with Richard Whiting); with Harry Warren he 
did "The Girl Friend of the Whirling Dervish", "Jeepers Creepers", 
and "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby". Mercer's 
lyrics are characterized by an unerring ear for rhythmic nuances, 
a puckish sense of humor expressed in language with a colloquial flair. 
Though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad lyric with 
the best of them, Mercer's forte is a highly polished quasi-folk wit.

His casual, dreamlike working methods, often as not <in absentia>, 
were an abrupt change from Harburg's, so that Arlen had 
to adjust again to another approach to collaboration. There were times 
that he worked with both lyricists simultaneously.   Speaking 
of his work with Johnny Mercer, Arlen says, "Our working habits 
were strange. After we got a script and the spots for the songs were 
blocked out, we'd get together for an hour or so every day. While Johnny 
made himself comfortable on the couch, I'd play the tunes for 
him. He has a wonderfully retentive memory. After I would finish 
playing the songs, he'd just go away without a comment. I wouldn't 
hear from him for a couple of weeks, then he'd come around with the 
completed lyric".   Arlen is one of the few (possibly the only) 
composer Mercer has been able to work with so closely, for they held 
their meetings in Arlen's study. "Some guys bothered me", 
Mercer has said. "I couldn't write with them in the same room with 
me, but I could with Harold. He is probably our most original composer; 
he often uses very odd rhythms, which makes it difficult, and 
challenging, for the lyric writer".   While Arlen and Mercer 
collaborated on <Hot Nocturne>, Mercer worked also with Arthur 
Schwartz on another film, <Navy Blues>. Arlen, too, worked on 
other projects at the same time with old friend Ted Koehler. Besides 
doing a single song, "When the Sun Comes Out", they worked on 
the ambitious <Americanegro Suite>, for voices and piano, as well 
as songs for films.   The <Americanegro Suite> is in a sense 
an extension of the Cotton Club songs in that it is a collection 
of Negro songs, not for a night club, but for the concert stage. The 
work had its beginning in 1938 with an eight-bar musical strain to which 
Koehler set the words "There'll be no more work/ There'll 
be no 
more worry", matching the spiritual feeling of the jot. This grew 
into the song "Big Time Comin'". By September 1940 the suite 
had developed into a collection of six songs, "four spirituals, a 
dream, and a lullaby".   The Negro composer Hall Johnson studied 
the <Americanegro Suite> and said of it, "Of all the many 
songs written by white composers and employing what claims to be a Negroid 
idiom in both words and music, these six songs by Harold Arlen 
and Ted Koehler easily stand far out above the rest. Thoroughly 
modern in treatment, they are at the same time, full of simple sincerity 
which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music and are by 
no means to be confused with the average 'Broadway Spirituals' 
which depend for their racial flavor upon sundry allusions to the 'Amen 
Corner', 'judgement day', 'Gabriel's horn', and a 
frustrated devil- with a few random 'Hallelujahs' thrown in for 
good measure.

I feel obliged to describe this cubbyhole. It had a single porcelain 
stall and but one cabinet for the chairing of the bards. It was 
here that the terror-stricken Dennis Moon played an unrehearsed role 
during the children's party. A much larger room, adjacent to the 
lavatory, served as a passageway to and from the skimpy toilet. That 
unused room was large enough for- well, say an elephant could get 
into it **h and, as a matter of fact, an elephant <did> **h   Something 
occurred on the morning of the children's party which may 
illustrate the kind of trouble our restricted toilet facilities caused 
us. It so happened that sports writer Arthur Robinson got out of the 
hospital that morning after promising his doctor that he would be back 
in 
an hour or two to continue his convalescence. Arthur Robinson traveled 
with the baseball clubs as staff correspondent for the <American>. 
He was ghost writer for Babe Ruth, whose main talent for literary 
composition was the signing of his autograph. Robbie was a war veteran 
with battle-shattered knees.   He arrived on crutches at the 
Newspaper Club with one of his great pals, Oliver Herford, artist, 
author, and foe of stupidity. Mr& Herford's appearance was that 
of a frustrated gnome. He seemed timid (<at first>), wore nose glasses 
from which a black ribbon dangled, and was no bigger than a jockey. 
Robinson asked Herford to escort him to the club's lavatory before 
they sat down for a highball and a game of cards. In the jakes, 
after Robbie and his crutches were properly stowed, Mr& Herford 
went to the adjoining facility. He had barely assumed his stance there 
when a fat fellow charged through the doorway. Without any regard for 
rest-room protocol, the hulking stranger almost knocked Herford off 
his pins. The artist-author said nothing, but stood to one side. He 
waited a long time. Nothing was said, nothing accomplished. The unrelieved 
stranger eventually turned away from the place of his- shall 
we dare say his Waterloo?- to go to the door.   Mr& Herford 
touched the fat man's arm. "Pardon me, sir. May I say that 
you have just demonstrated the truth of an old proverb- the younger 
Pliny's, if memory serves me- which, translated freely from the 
archaic Latin, says, 'The more haste, the less peed'".

Governor Alfred E& Smith was the official host at the children's 
party. United States Senator Royal S& Copeland was wearing 
the robes of Santa Claus and a great white beard; the Honorable 
Robert Wagner, Sr&, at that time a justice of the New York Supreme 
Court, was on the reception committee. I was in charge of the 
arrangements- which were soon enough disarranged.   I had had 
difficulties from the very first day. When, in my enthusiasm, I proposed 
the party, my city editor (who disliked the club and many of its 
members) tried to block my participation in the gala event. Even earlier 
than that he had resented the fact that I had been chosen to edit 
the club's <Reporter>.   City editor Victor Watson of the 
New York <American> was a man of brooding suspicions and mysterious 
shifts of mood. Mr& Hearst's telegraphic code word for Victor 
Watson was "fatboy". The staff saw in him the qualities of a 
Don Cossack, hence, as mentioned before, his nickname "the Hetman".

The Hetman's physical aspects were not those of a savage 
rider of the steppes. Indeed, he looked more like a well-fleshed 
lay brother of the Hospice of St& Bernard. Nor were his manners 
barbaric. He had a purring voice and poker player's immobility of features 
which somehow conveyed the feeling that he knew where all the 
bodies were buried. He was the son of a Scottish father and an American 
Jewish mother, long widowed, with whom he lived in a comfortable 
home in Flushing. He had worked in the newspaper business since he 
was nineteen years old, always for the Hearst service. From the very 
first he regarded himself as Mr& Hearst's disciple, defender, and 
afterward his prime minister, self-ordained.   It was said that 
the Hetman plotted to take over the entire Hearst newspaper empire 
one day by means of various coups: the destruction of editors who 
tried to halt his course, the unfrocking of publishers whose mistakes 
of judgment might be magnified in secret reports to Mr& Hearst. Whatever 
the Hetman's ambitions, his colleagues were kept ill at ease. 
Among the outstanding members of the Hearst cabinet whom he successfully 
opposed for a time were the great Arthur Brisbane, Bradford 
Merrill, S&S& Carvalho, and Colonel Van Hamm. He also disliked 
Runyon, for no good reason other than the fact that the Demon's 
talent was so marked as to put him well beyond the Hetman's say-so 
or his supervision.   Runyon, for his part, had a contemptuous 
regard for Mr& Watson. "He's a wrong-o", said Runyon, 
"and I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw the Statue of 
Liberty".   Arthur "Bugs" Baer wrote to me just recently, 
"Vic wanted to die in harness, with his head towards the wagon. 
He supported his mother and his brother, who afterwards committed 
suicide. Watson told me that his brother always sent roses to his mother, 
blossoms bought with Vic's allowance to him. 'And would you 
believe it', Vic added, 'she likes him better than she does me. 
Why'"?   About the only time the Hetman seemed excited 
was 
when one of his own pet ideas was born. Then he would get to his feet, 
as though rising in honor of his own remarkable powers, and say almost 
invariably, "Gentlemen, this is an amazing story! It's bigger 
than the Armistice".   Some of the Hetman's "ideas" 
were dream-ridden, vaguely imparted, and at times preposterous. One 
day he assigned me to lay bare a "plot" by the Duponts to supply 
munitions to a wholly fictitious revolution he said was about to occur 
in Cuba. He said that his information was so secret that he would 
not be able to confide in me the origin of his pipeline tip.   "I 
can tell you this much", he said. It's bigger than the Armistice".

I worked for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment 
and consulted several of my own well-informed sources. Then I spent 
the next two days at the baseball park and at Jack Doyle's pool 
parlors. When I returned to make my report, the Hetman did not remember 
having sent me on the secret mission. He was busy, he said, in 
having someone submit to a monkey-gland operation. And I was to go 
to work on that odd matter. I shall tell of it later on.   The 
Hetman had a strong liking for a story, any story which was to be had 
by means of much sleuthing or by roundabout methods. Most of my stories 
were obtained by simply seeking out the person who could give me
