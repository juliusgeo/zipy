of selected cases of interest to military medicine and of establishing 
through the mechanism of follow-up of living patients the natural 
history of various diseases of military-medical importance. The American 
Registry of Pathology operates as a cooperative enterprise in 
medical research and education between the Armed Forces Institute of 
Pathology and the civilian medical profession on a national and international 
basis, under such conditions as may be agreed upon between 
the National Research Council and The Surgeons General of the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force. The staff utilized the collected material 
in these registries for numerous lectures to national and international 
meetings, exhibits, and published studies. During the period of this 
report, 37,470 new cases were entered into the various registries. 
These were selected carefully and included not only detailed clinical 
information but adequate pathology of value for research and educational 
purposes.   In this same period, six new fascicles of the Atlas 
of Tumor Pathology were published and distributed to medical centers 
world-wide. There were 54,320 copies of fascicles sold and 642 
copies distributed free during this period. Forty-five new Clinico-pathologic 
Conferences were prepared, bringing the total to 61 available 
for loan distribution. Nine new teaching Clinico-pathologic Conference 
sets were prepared, which makes a total of 70 types of teaching 
sets for loan. During this period, 7,827 teaching sets were distributed 
on loan. The Clinico-pathologic Conferences have been acknowledged 
as of great value and in consequent great demand by the small isolated 
military hospitals. The demand for teaching sets continues unabated 
since they provide the means for the military physicians to review 
the pathology of selected disease processes or organ systems for review 
of basic sciences and correlation of clinical physiological behavior 
with structural changes. _THE MEDICAL MUSEUM_ In fiscal year 1959, 
the Medical Museum was moved to Chase Hall, a temporary building 
on Independence Avenue at Ninth Street, Southwest, and continued 
to display to the public the achievements of the Armed Forces Medical 
Services. During the period of this report, 63 panel exhibits 
depicting the latest developments in medical research were displayed. 
Of the 375 exhibits (of all types) shown, 161 were new or refurbished. 
Of the 885 specimens newly mounted or refurbished, 254 were prepared 
for other agencies. Eighty-five specimens were loaned for study 
purposes. An exhibit, "Macropathology- An Ancient Art, A new 
Science", was presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical 
Association.   A three-dimensional exhibit depicting "A 
Century of Naval Medicine" was formally presented to The Director 
by George S& Squibb, great-grandson of the founder of E& 
R& Squibb and Sons, for permanent display in the Museum.

Space was provided for short-time guest medical exhibits, and the 
Museum collected new accessions of microscopes, medical, surgical, and 
diagnostic instruments, uniform, and similar items of historical medico-military 
significance.   During the period, the laboratory rendered 
centralized macropathological service to qualified requesters. 
Specimens were mounted for military installations, governmental agencies, 
and medical schools.   Three hundred five copies of the <Manual 
of Macropathological Techniques> were distributed. Thirty-five 
military and civilian students received laboratory training.

During fiscal years 1959 and 1960, there were 795,586 visitors to the 
Museum.   During the period from 1 July 1960 through 31 January 
1961, the Medical Museum was required to move to Temporary Building 
"~S" on the Mall from Chase Hall. Throughout the period 
and during the movement operation, the Museum continued its functional 
support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. 

#ARMED FORCES 
MEDICAL PUBLICATION AGENCY#

The Armed Forces Medical Publication 
Agency, established in 1949, has published, since January 1950, 
the United States Armed Forces Medical Journal as a triservice 
publication 
to furnish material of professional interest to Medical Department 
officers of the three military services. Its supplement, the Medical 
Technicians Bulletin, supplied similar material to enlisted 
medical personnel. These publications replaced the U& S& Naval 
Medical Bulletin, published continuously from 1907 through 1959, as 
well as the Navy's Hospital Corps Quarterly and the Bulletin of 
the U& S& Army Medical Department, published from 1922 to 1949. 
In addition, their establishment made it unnecessary to begin publication 
of a contemplated Air Force medical bulletin. Estimated annual 
savings resulting from publication of the Journal and Bulletin 
on a triservice basis, as compared with the cost of producing separate 
periodicals for each service, were between $65,000 and $70,000. Additionally, 
on the many ships at sea and in the smaller naval stations, 
the availability of the Journal removed the necessity of subscribing 
to several additional journals of civilian origin over and above the 
quantity now authorized, in order to provide any reasonably comparable 
coverage.   From 1 July 1958 to 30 June 1960, 24 numbers of 
the 
Journal and nine of the Bulletin were published. Each Journal contained 
articles of professional and clinical interest, and departments 
devoted to military medical news, reviews of new books, and other features 
of interest to officers of the medical services. The Council 
on National Defense of the American Medical Association contributed 
a brief article to each issue entitled, "This is Your A&M&A&".

Beginning with the October 1959 issue of the Journal, 
the method of production of copy for photo-offset reproduction was 
changed from varityping to hot typesetting. This resulted in an improved 
appearance, but was followed by an increase in printing cost that 
necessitated the institution of major economies to keep within the total 
of allocated funds. The use of 100 instead of 140 substance paper 
plus the adoption of side stapling beginning with the May 1960 issue 
reduced costs sufficiently to allow completion of the fiscal year with 
nearly $4,000 in unexpended funds.   Two special issues were 
published, one for November 1959 on Space Medicine, the other the 
Tenth Anniversary issue for January 1960. The February 1960 issue 
marked the reinstitution of the section entitled, "The Medical Officer 
Writes". Replacing the discontinued Medical Technicians 
Bulletin, 
publication of which was suspended with the November-December 
1959 issue, a section called "Technical Notes" was inaugurated 
on a bimonthly basis beginning with the April 1960 issue. Occasional 
features were published on historical medicine, special reports, bibliography, 
and "Collector's Items". In May 1960, the Armed 
Forces Institute of Pathology began a series of articles on the "Medical 
Museum", and in June, the Institute started contributing 
a regular monthly "Case for Diagnosis". The Institute also planned 
to furnish a regular series of articles, beginning in the fall 
of 1960, on its more significant Scientific Exhibits.   The Armed 
Forces Epidemiological Board agreed to submit each month a report 
for one of its 12 commissions, so that each commission will report 
once a year on some phase of its work calculated to be of particular interest 
and value to medical officers of the Armed Forces. The first 
report in this continuing series appeared in the September 1960 issue 
of the Journal. 
Another recent achievement was the successful development of a method 
for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine 
when the product is relatively non-volatile. This work gave a heat 
of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiates a value 
which had been determined by a less direct method, and raises this 
property to 15 percent above that accepted a few years ago. Similar measurements 
are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy in the 
heat of formation of another important combustion product, beryllium fluoride.

The development and testing of new apparatus to measure 
other properties is nearing completion. In one of these, an exploding-wire 
device to study systems thermodynamically up to 6,000 **f and 
100 atmospheres pressure, a major goal was achieved. The accuracy of 
measuring the total electrical energy entering an exploding wire during 
a few microseconds was verified when two independent types of comparison 
with the heat energy produced had an uncertainty of less than 2 
percent. This agreement is considered very good for such short time intervals. 
The method of calibration employs a fixed resistance element 
as a calorimeter. The element is inserted 
in the discharge circuit in place of the exploding wire, 
and the calorimetric heating of the element is measured with high accuracy. 
This is used as a reference for comparing the ohmic heating and 
the electrical energy obtained from the measured current through the 
element and the measured voltage across the element.   A high-speed 
shutter has been developed in order to permit photographic observation 
of any portion of the electrical wire explosion. The shutter consists 
of two parts: a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part. Using 
Edgerton's method, the fast-closing action is obtained from the 
blackening of a window by exploding a series of parallel lead wires. 
The fast-opening of the shutter consists of a piece of aluminum foil 
(approximately **f) placed directly in front of the camera lens so that 
no light may pass into the camera. The opening action is obtained 
when a capacitor, charged to high voltage, is suddenly discharged through 
the foil. During the discharge the magnetic forces set up by the 
passage of current cause the edges of the foil to roll inward toward 
its center line, thus allowing light to pass into the camera. Experiments 
have shown that the shutter is 75 percent open in about 60-80 microseconds. 
The shutter aperture may be made larger or smaller by changing 
the foil area and adjusting the electrical energy input to the foil. 
_LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OF INTERSTELLAR RADIO SPECTRA._ Besides 
the well-known hydrogen line at 21 ~cm wavelength, the spectra of 
extraterrestrial radio sources may contain sharp lines characteristic 
of other atoms, ions, and small molecules. The detection and study 
of such line spectra would add considerably to present information on 
interstellar gas clouds and, perhaps, planetary atmospheres. Among the 
most likely producers of detectable radio line spectra are the light 
diatomic hydrides ~OH and ~CH; somewhat less likely sources 
are the heavier hydrides ~SH, ~SiH, and ~ScH. Very small 
concentrations of these hydrides should be detectable; in interstellar 
gas, concentrations as low as **f molecules/**f may be sufficient, 
as compared to the **f hydrogen atoms **f required for detection of 
the 21-~cm line.   High sensitivity in radio telescopes is achieved 
by reducing the bandwidth of the receiver; therefore, only with 
precise foreknowledge of the line frequencies is an astronomical 
search for the radio spectra of these molecules feasible. To secure precise 
measurements of these frequencies, a research program in free radical 
microwave spectroscopy has been started. Since conventional methods 
are insensitive at the low frequencies of these molecular transitions, 
the paramagnetic resonance method is being used instead. This 
involves the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor, 
which shifts the low-frequency spectra to a conveniently high microwave 
range, where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity.

The first diatomic hydride investigated by the paramagnetic resonance 
method was the ~OH radical. Results of this experiment include 
the frequencies of the two strong spectral lines by which ~OH may 
be identified in interstellar gas; the frequencies are 1665.32 and 
1667.36 **f, with an uncertainty of 0.10 **f. Success in observing these 
spectral lines has so far, apparently, been confined to the laboratory; 
extraterrestrial observations have yet to be reported. Preparations 
are being made for similar experiments on ~CH and ~SH 
radicals. _LOW TEMPERATURE THERMOMETRY._ The Bureau is pursuing 
an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration 
services in the range 1.5 to 20 **f. The efforts and accomplishments 
fall into three main categories: absolute thermometry based 
upon the velocity of sound in helium gas, secondary thermometry involving 
principally studies of the behavior of germanium resistors, and helium-4
