mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion makes any 
speculation upon this part of one's parents' experience more immodest, 
more scandalizing, more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from 
a stranger. I recoil from the very thought. At the same time, I am 
aware that my recoil could be interpreted by readers of the tea leaves 
at the bottom of my psyche as an incestuous sign, since theirs is a science 
of paradox: if one hates, they say it is because one loves; 
if one bullies, they say it is because one is afraid; if one shuns, 
they say it is because one desires; and according to them, whatever 
one fancies one feels, what one feels in fact is the opposite. Well, 
normally abnormal or normally normal, neurotic or merely fastidious (do 
the tea-leaf readers, by the way, allow psyches to have moral taste?), 
I have never wanted to know what you knew of passion. ##

YOU 
PROBABLY WOULD NOT REMEMBER, SINCE YOU NEVER seemed to remember 
even 
the same moments as I, much less their intensity, one sunny midday on 
Fifth Avenue when you had set out with me for some final shopping 
less than a week before the wedding you staged for me with such reluctance 
at the Farm. I can see us now. We had been walking quite briskly, 
for despite your being so small and me so tall, your stride in those 
days could easily match mine. We had stopped before a shop window 
to assess its autumnal display, when you suddenly turned to me, looking 
up from beneath one of your wrong hats, and with your nervous "ahem"! 
said: "There are things I must tell you about this man you 
are marrying which he does not know himself". If you had screamed 
right there in the street where we stood, I could not have felt more 
fear. With scarcely a mumble of excuse, I fled. I fled, however, 
not from what might have been the natural fear of being unable to disguise 
from you that the things about my bridegroom- in the sense you 
meant the word "things"- which you had been galvanizing yourself 
to tell me as a painful part of your maternal duty were things which 
I had already insisted upon finding out for myself (despite, I may now 
say, the unspeakable awkwardness of making the discovery on principle, 
yes, on principle, and in cold blood) because I was resolved, as 
a modern woman, not to be a mollycoddle waiting for Life but to seize 
Life by the throat. I had developed too foolproof a facade to be afraid 
of self-betrayal. What I fled from was my fear of what, unwittingly, 
you might betray, without meaning to, about my father and yourself.

But I can see from this latest trick of memory how much 
more arbitrary and influential it is than the will. While my memory 
holds with relentless tenacity, as I cannot too often stress, to my wrongs, 
when it comes to my shames, it gestures and jokes and toys with 
chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distracting me from 
them. Just as I was about to enlarge upon my discovery of the underside 
of the leaf of love, memory, displeased at being asked to yield its 
unsavory secrets, dashed ahead of me, calling back over its shoulder: 
"Skip it. Cut it out". But I will not skip it or cut it 
out. 
It is not my intention in this narrative to picture myself as a helpless 
victim moored to the rock of experience and left to the buffetings 
of chance. If to be innocent is to be helpless, then I had been- 
as are we all- helpless at the start. But the time came when I was 
no longer innocent and therefore no longer helpless. Helpless in that 
sense I can never be again. However, I confess my hope that I 
will be innocent again, not with a pristine, accidental innocence, but 
rather with an innocence achieved by the slow cutting away of the flesh 
to reach the bone.   For innocence, of all the graces of the 
spirit, is I believe the one most to be prayed for. Although it is constantly 
made to look foolish (too simple to come in out of the rain, 
people say, who have found in the innocent an impediment), it does not 
mind looking foolish because it is not concerned with how it looks. 
It assumes that things are as they seem when they seem best, and when 
they seem worst it overlooks them. To innocence, a word given is a word 
that will be kept. Instinctively, innocence does unto others as it 
expects to be done by. But when these expectations are once too often 
ground into the dust, innocence can falter, since its strength is according 
to the strength of him who possesses it. The innocence of which 
I speak is, I know, not incorruptible. But I insist upon believing 
that even when it is lost, it may, like paradise, be regained.

However, it was not of innocence in general that I was speaking, 
but of perhaps the frailest and surely the least important side of 
it which is innocence in romantic love. Here, if anywhere, it is not 
wholly incontrovertible. To you, for instance, the word innocence, in 
this connotation, probably retained its Biblical, or should I say 
technical sense, and therefore I suppose I must make myself quite clear 
by saying that I lost- or rather handed over- what you would 
have considered to be my innocence two weeks before I was legally entitled, 
and in fact by oath required, to hand it over along with what other 
goods and bads I had. But to me innocence is far less tangible. 
I had long since begun to lose my general innocence when I lost my 
trust in you, but this special innocence I lost before ever I loved, 
through my discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience 
a flaming delight that had nothing, nothing whatever to do with 
friendship or liking, let alone with love. I knew this knowledge to 
be corrupting at the time I acquired it; today, these many years later, 
after all the temptations resisted or yielded to, the weasel satisfactions 
and the engulfing dissatisfactions since endured, I call it 
corrupting still.   You, I could swear to it, remained innocent 
in this sense until the end. Yours, but not mine, was an age in which 
innocence was fostered and carefully- if not perhaps altogether 
innocently- preserved. You had grown up at a time when the most distinguishing 
mark of a lady was the <noli me tangere> writ plain across 
her face. Moreover, because of the particular blot on your family 
escutcheon through what may only have been one unbridled moment on your 
grandmother's part, and because you had the lean-to kitchen and trundle 
bed of your childhood to outgrow, what you obviously most desired 
with both your conscious and unconscious person, what you bent your 
whole will, sensibility, and intelligence upon, was to be a lady. Before 
being daughter, wife, or mother, before being cultured (a word now 
bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you children of frontiersmen 
bestowed on it), before being sorry for the poor, progressive 
about public health, and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian, 
indeed first and foremost, you were a lady. There was, of course, 
more to the portrait of a lady you carried in your mind's eye than 
the <sine qua non> of her virtue. A lady, you made clear to me both 
by precept and example, never raised her voice or slumped in her chair, 
never failed in social tact (in heaven, for instance, would not mention 
St& John the Baptist's head), never pouted or withdrew or 
scandalized in company, never reminded others of her physical presence 
by unseemly sound or gesture, never indulged in public scenes or private 
confidences, never spoke of money save in terms of alleviating suffering, 
never gossiped or maligned, never stressed but always minimized 
the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself. 
With each song he gave verbal footnotes. The songs Sandburg sang often 
reminded listeners of songs of a kindred character they knew entirely 
or in fragments. Often these listeners would refer Sandburg to persons 
who had similar ballads or ditties. In due time Sandburg was 
a walking thesaurus of American folk music.   After he had finished 
the first two volumes of his <Lincoln>, Sandburg went to work 
assembling a book of songs out of hobo and childhood days and from the 
memory of songs others had taught him. He rummaged, found composers 
and arrangers, collaborated on the main design and outline of harmonization 
with musicians, ballad singers, and musicologists.   The 
result was a collection of 280 songs, ballads, ditties, brought together 
from all regions of America, more than one hundred never before published: 
<The American Songbag>. Each song or ditty was prefaced 
by an author's note which indicated the origin and meaning of the 
song as well as special interest the song had, musical arrangement, 
and most of the chorus and verses.   The book, published in 1927, 
has been selling steadily ever since. As Sandburg said at the time: 
"It is as ancient as the medieval European ballads brought to 
the Appalachian Mountains, it is as modern as skyscrapers, the Volstead 
Act, and the latest oil well gusher". 

#SCHOPENHAUER NEVER LEARNED# 

Sandburg is in constant demand as an entertainer. Two things 
contribute to his popularity. First, Carl respects his audience and 
prepares his speeches carefully. Even when he is called upon for impromptu 
remarks, he has notes written on the back of handy envelopes. 
He has his own system of shorthand, devised by abbreviations: "humility" 
will be "humly", "with" will be "~w", and "that" 
will be "~tt".   The second reason for his popularity 
is his complete spontaneity with the guitar. It is a mistake, however, 
to imagine that Sandburg uses the guitar as a prop. He is no dextrous-fingered 
college boy but rather a dedicated, humble, and bashful 
apostle of this instrument. At age seventy-four, he became what he 
shyly terms a "pupil" of Andres Segovia, the great guitarist of 
the Western world.   It is not easy to become Segovia's pupil. 
One needs high talent. Segovia has written about Carl: 
"His fingers labor heavily on the strings and he asked for my help 
in disciplining them. I found that this precocious, grown-up boy of 
74 deserved to be taught. There has long existed a brotherly affection 
between us, thus I accepted him as my pupil. Just as in the case of 
every prodigy child, we must watch for the efficacy of my teaching to 
show up in the future- if he should master all the strenuous exercises 
I inflicted on him.   To play the guitar as he aspires will 
devour his three-fold energy as a historian, a poet and a singer. One 
cause of Schopenhauer's pessimism was the fact that he failed to 
learn the guitar. I am certain that Carl Sandburg will not fall into 
the same sad philosophy. The heart of this great poet constantly bubbles 
forth a generous joy of life- with or without the guitar".

The public's identification of Carl Sandburg and the guitar 
is no happenstance. Nor does Carl reject this identity.   He 
is proud of having Segovia for a friend and dedicated a poem to him 
titled "The Guitar".   Carl says it is the greatest poem 
ever written to the guitar because he has never heard of any other poem 
to that subtle instrument. "A portable companion always ready to 
go where you go- a small friend weighing less than a freshborn infant- 
to be shared with few or many- just two of you in sweet meditation".

The <New York Herald Tribune's> photographer, 
Ira Rosenberg, tells an anecdote about the time he wanted to take a 
picture of Carl playing a guitar. Carl hadn't brought his along. Mr& 
Rosenberg suggested that they go out and find one.   "Preferably", 
said Carl, "one battered and worn, such as might be found 
in a pawnshop".   They went to the pawnshop of Joseph Miller 
of 1162 Sixth Avenue.   "Mr& Miller was in the shop", 
the <Herald Tribune> story related, "but was reluctant to have 
anybody's picture taken inside, because his business was too 'confidential' 
for pictures.   "But after introductions he asked: 
'Carl Sandburg? Well <you> can pose inside'. 
"He wanted Mr& Sandburg to pose with one of the guitars he had 
displayed behind glass in the center of his shop, but the poet eyed this 
somewhat distastefully. 'Kalamazoo guitars', he said, 'used 
by radio hillbilly singers'.   "He chose one from Mr& Miller's 
window, a plain guitar with no fancy polish. While the picture 
was taken, Mr& Miller's disposition to be generous to Mr& 
Sandburg increased to the point where he advised, 'I won't even 
charge you the one dollar rental fee'". 

#A KNOWLEDGEABLE CELEBRITY# 

When someone in the audience rose and asked how does it feel to 
be a celebrity, Carl said, "A celebrity is a fellow who eats celery
