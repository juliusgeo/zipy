rate of 9.3 ~mg/~l/~hr. The actual power requirements indicated 
2~lb oxygen transfer/~hr/~hp. The polyethylene cover reduced 
the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent, indicating that the maximum 
oxygen transfer is at the rotor rather than through the surface. 

#OXIDATION 
POND#

During this study septic conditions developed in the 
oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melted. Shortly after this 
study ended septic conditions resulted which required the addition of 
sodium nitrate. The location of the oxidation pond in a high-value 
residential area makes odor nuisances a sensitive problem for the developer. 
The organic concentration in the influent raw sewage ranged from 
160 to 270 ~mg/~l of ~BOD with an average of 230 ~mg/~l. 
The ~BOD data are given in Table /4,. A single 24-~hr composite 
sample had a ~BOD of 260 ~mg/~l, indicating a typical 
domestic sewage. The daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond averaged 
147,000 ~gpd, giving a retention period of 42 days. The organic 
loading on the pond was slightly under 60~lb~BOD/day/acre.

The effluent ~BOD averaged 34 ~mg/~l, a little lower 
than that of the study at Fayette indicated for a loading of 60~lb 
~BOD/day/acre. The ~BOD of the effluent ranged from a 
minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47~mg/~l. Microscopic examination of 
the effluent showed that minimum ~BOD occurred when the algae began 
to decrease with cold weather. When the algae began to build up 
again, the effluent ~BOD rose. During the two weeks when the algae 
disappeared from the effluent ~BOD's in the effluent were 18 
and 16 ~mg/~l.

Thus, the three main categories of antisubmarine warfare operations 
are defense of shipping, defense of naval forces, and area defense. 
The last category overlaps the others in amphibious operations and 
near terminals and bases.   To effect these operations, five elements 
exist (1) surface, (2) air, (3) mines, (4) submarine, and (5) 
fixed installations. Surface forces have been used to provide defense 
zones around naval and merchant ship formations, air to furnish area 
surveillance, and mines for protection of limited areas. Submarines and 
shore installations are new elements. The submarine now has a definite 
place in submarine defense particularly in denying enemy access to 
ocean areas. Fixed installations offer possibilities for area detection. 
Mine warfare is being reoriented against submarine targets.

A sixth element, not always considered, is intelligence. It includes 
operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment. 
Operational intelligence presumably will be available from our 
national intelligence agencies; intelligence on the environment will 
come from the recently augmented program in oceanography. The major 
postwar development is the certainty that these elements should not be 
considered singly but in combination and as being mutually supporting. 

#NECESSITY FOR AN OVER-ALL CONCEPT#

Thinking on submarine defense 
has not always been clear-cut. Proponents of single elements tend 
to ensure predominance of that element without determining if it is justified, 
and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponents 
has assumed the greatest importance. Consequently, air, surface, 
and submarine elements overshadow the mine, fixed installations, 
and intelligence. These have sought more and more of what they have. 
Each seems to strive for elimination of the necessity for the others. 
This, despite postwar experience demonstrating that all elements are 
necessarily mutually supporting. Thus, the most productive areas are 
not necessarily the most stressed. This is stated to emphasize the necessity 
for an over-all concept of submarine defense, one which would 
provide positions of relative importance to ~ASW elements based on 
projected potentialities. Then the enthusiasm and energy of all elements 
can be channeled to produce cumulative progress toward a common 
objective. An over-all concept would have other advantages. It would 
allow presentation to the public of a unified approach. Now the problem 
is presented piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily. While one 
element 
is announcing progress, another is delineating its problems. The 
result can only be confusion in the public mind. A unified concept 
can serve as a guide to budgeting and, if public support is gained, will 
command Congressional support. Industry's main criticism of the 
Navy's antisubmarine effort is that it cannot determine where any 
one company or industry can apply its skills and know-how. Lacking guidance, 
industry picks its own areas. The result, coupled with the salesmanship 
for which American industry is famous, is considerable expenditure 
of funds and efforts in marginal areas. An over-all concept 
will guide industry where available talents and facilities will yield 
greatest dividends. Therefore, a broad concept of over-all submarine 
defense is needed for co-ordination of the Navy's efforts, for a logical 
presentation to the public, for industry's guidance, and as a 
basis for a program to the Congress. 

#PRINCIPLES INVOLVED IN AN OVER-ALL 
CONCEPT#

That which follows will be a discussion of principles 
and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare. 
Russia possesses the preponderance of submarines in the world, divided 
between her various fleets. Some are also in Albania and others 
are on loan to Egypt. Other countries which may willingly or unwillingly 
become Communist can furnish bases. Communist target areas can 
be assumed, but there is no certainty that such assumptions coincide 
with Soviet intentions. Attack can come from almost any direction against 
many locations. Logically, then, the first principle of the plan 
must be that it is not rigidly oriented toward any geographical area.

It is often stated that the submarine can be destroyed while 
building, at bases, in transit, and on station. Destruction of the enemy's 
building and base complex, however, requires attacks on enemy 
territory, which is possible only in event of all-out hostilities. In 
transit or on station, it may not be possible to attack the submarines 
until commission of an overt act. The Communists are adept at utilizing 
hostilities short of general war and will do so whenever it is 
to their advantage. Therefore the second principle of the plan must be 
that, while providing for all-out hostilities, its effectiveness is 
not dependent on general war.   Antisubmarine warfare does not involve 
clashes between large opposing forces, with the decision a result 
of a single battle. It is a war of attrition, of single actions, 
of an exchange of losses. This exchange must result in our ending up 
with some effective units. Initially, having fewer units of some elements- 
especially submarines- than the opponent, our capabilities need 
to be sufficiently greater than theirs, so that the exchange will 
be in our favor. Therefore, the third principle of the plan must be that 
it does not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same types, 
unless at an assured favorable exchange rate.   The submarine 
has increased its effectiveness by several orders of magnitude since 
World War /2,. Its speed has increased, it operates at increasingly 
greater depths, its submerged endurance is becoming unlimited, and 
it will become even more silent. The next developments will probably 
be in weaponry. The missile can gradually be expected to replace the 
torpedo. As detection ranges increase, weapons will be developed to 
attack other submarines and surface craft at these ranges. Therefore, 
the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously 
increasing capabilities in the opponent.   No element can accomplish 
the total objective of submarine defense. Some elements support 
the others, 
but all have limitations. Some limitations of one element 
can be compensated for by a capability of another. Elements used 
in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum 
of the capabilities of the individual elements. Therefore, the plan's 
fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capabilities of 
all elements in combination.   Conceivably the submarine defense 
problem can be solved by sufficient forces. Numbers would be astronomical 
and current fiscal policies make this an impractical solution. 
Shipbuilding, aircraft procurement, and weapon programs indicate that 
there will not be enough of anything. Therefore, any measures taken 
in peacetime which will decrease force requirements in war will contribute 
greatly to success when hostilities occur. Therefore, the sixth 
principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measures 
which will reduce future force requirements.   The world is constantly 
changing; what was new yesterday is obsolescent today. The 
seventh principle of the plan is self-evident; it must be flexible enough 
to allow for technological breakthroughs, scientific progress, and 
changes in world conditions. 

#SUPPORTING ELEMENTS IN ~ASW OPERATIONS# 

To this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense 
has been demonstrated, the mission has been stated, broad principles 
delineating its content laid down, and the supporting elements listed. 
Before considering these elements in more detail, an additional 
requirement should be stated. Large area coverage will accomplish all 
other tasks. Therefore, because reduction in tasks results in reduction 
of forces required, the plan should provide for expanding area coverage. 
But it must be remembered that the plan should not be oriented 
geographically. Consequently, the system giving area coverage (if such 
coverage is less than world wide) must be flexible and hence at least 
partially mobile. Since effective area coverage appears fairly remote, 
the requirement can be borne in mind while considering the elements: 
air, surface, sub-surface, fixed installations, mines, and intelligence. 
These are arranged approximately in the order of the vociferousness 
of their proponents but will be discussed in the reverse order 
in the hope that the true order of importance will result. ##

<Intelligence>, 
as used herein, will include information on possible 
opponents and on the environment which can affect operations. These can 
be referred to as operational intelligence and environmental intelligence. 
In submarine defense these must have maximum stress. Good operational 
intelligence can ensure sound planning, greatly reduce force 
requirements, 
and increase tactical effectiveness. Environmental intelligence 
is just as important. The ocean presently co-operates with the 
target. Full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the 
environment to our side, resulting in an increase in effectiveness of 
equipment and tactics, a decrease in enemy capabilities, and the development 
of methods of capitalizing on the environment. Therefore, improved 
intelligence will result in reduced force requirements and, as 
it supports all other elements, rates a top priority. Gathering intelligence 
is important, but of equal importance is its translation into 
usable form.   A program is needed to translate the results of oceanographic 
research into tactical and operating instructions. Approaching 
this problem on a statistical basis is invalid, because the opponent 
has the same sources available and will be encountered not under 
average conditions, but under the conditions most advantageous to him. 
Therefore, the on-the-scene commander must have detailed operating 
instructions based on measurement of conditions, in the area, at the time 
of encounter. All capabilities must be used to maximum advantage 
then. Temperature, wind, oxygen content, depth, bottom character, and 
animal life are the chief environmental variables. There may be others. 
Variations in sound velocity should be measured rather than temperature, 
because more of the variables would be encompassed. These variations 
must eventually be measured horizontally as well as vertically. 
Progress in predicting water conditions is encouraging, but little
