set awhile before applying the second. The mortar was three parts sand 
to two of lime. Some of the lime that is always on hand in the Capitol 
basement for plaster repairs was slaked several months for us; 
but to make it stiffer, of a really putty-like consistency to avoid cracking, 
we added a little hydrated lime- hard on the hands, but we 
could see no other disadvantage. I am told that a mortar longer slaked 
might have remained longer in condition for painting. As it was, it 
took the pigment well for six hours, enough for our purpose, and held 
it firmly in setting. It was obvious that to match Brumidi, white must 
be mixed with all but the darkest tones. Lime white, hard and brilliant, 
has a tendency to "jump" away from the other colors in drying, 
and also by its capacity to set, to preclude the use of ready-made 
gradations, so useful in decorative work. In older Italian practice, 
lime, dried and reground "bianco sangiovanni", entered into such 
prepared shades. For convenience we chose a stronger pigment, 
unknown 
to the early Italians or to Brumidi, titanium oxide, reserving the 
active lime white for highest lights, put on at the end of the day's 
stint. Other pigments were mostly raw umber, some burnt umber, and 
a little yellow ochre. This last was probably not in Brumidi's palette, 
but was needed to take the chill, bluish look off the new work next 
to the old, where softening effects 
of time were seen, even after thorough 
cleaning. The use of "secco" we tried to restrict to covering 
joints. Experience showed, however, that it is very difficult to 
paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty 
and uneven. Later Brumidi and Costaggini will be seen coping with this 
same problem. We were forced, as they were, to work a good deal of 
tempera into background and dark areas. We made it by Doerner's 
recipe, five parts thoroughly washed cheese curd to one of lime putty; 
ground together they made a strong adhesive, which became waterproof 
in drying.   Figure 1 was taken in 1953. The new part is finished. 
On the right is the Brumidi Liberty group, as it looked after 
cleaning operations, which had not yet come around to the other end; 
where, of Costaggini, only some foliage has been washed, at the point 
where his work stopped. One is led to speculate as to why the empty 
space was there, left for our century to finish. Costaggini said it 
was Brumidi's fault in not providing enough material to fill the circle. 
Brumidi's son later maintained that Costaggini had compressed 
and mutilated his father's designs, ambitiously coveting a bit he 
could claim for his very own. This question might be settled by comparing 
the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimensions 
noted, presumably in Brumidi's hand, above the various sections of 
his long preparatory drawing, which has been kept. Whose ever 
fault, 
it is evident that Brumidi intended to fill out the whole frieze with 
his "histories" and come full circle with the scene of the discovery 
of California gold. In painting a fresco, the handling of wet mortar 
compels one always to move from top to bottom and from left to right, 
not to spoil yesterday's work with today's plastering. At the 
very first, then, Brumidi was required, by the classically pyramidal 
shape of his central group, to fill in the triangular space above the 
seated girl on Liberty's right, before starting on the allegorical 
figures themselves. Here he put a small man, whose missing hands 
might have left his function doubtful, until comparison with the first 
sketches showed that when the artist came back to the beginning, this 
was to be the closing figure of the party of "forty-niners", and 
was to hold a basket. One sees Costaggini's rendering of the same 
figure more than thirty feet away. The photograph, Figure 1 of the completed 
frieze, shows how, having been separated from his fellows in 
useless isolation for eighty years, he has now been given a hand, and 
by juxtaposition (and the permission of the Committee), given a new job, 
to represent the witnesses of the first flight at Kitty Hawk in 
1903.   The startlingly bright effect of the first washings led 
the Committee to order the rest of the Brumidi-Costaggini cycle cleaned 
and restored to go with them. The fixed wooden scaffold was removed, 
and, so as to reach all the frieze, one of pipe, on wheels, built 
up from the floor. Every few days, in the early morning, as the work 
progressed, twenty men would appear to push it ahead and to shift the 
plank foundation that distributed its weight widely on the Rotunda 
pavement, supported as it is by ancient brick vaulting.   On this 
giddy and oscillating platform over fifty feet from the floor, after 
a first dusting, we began to wash. A most useful tool for wetting the 
surface without running down was made from a greenhouse "mist spray" 
nozzle welded to a hose connection, to be used at low water pressure. 
A valve in the handle let us cut the pressure still lower. One 
man sprayed, with a sponge in hand to check excess wetting. A second 
assistant mopped with two sponges. In parts a repeated sponging was 
needed, but everywhere we found that water alone was enough to restore 
the original brightness. No soap or other cleaning agent was used that 
might bring in unwanted chemical reactions. The painting "a fresco" 
stood up superbly; a little of the "secco" came off. Necessary 
retouching was put on at once. Altogether we found the craftsmanship 
first rate, especially Brumidi's. We were greatly helped by 
there being no traces of former restoring. Apparently not more than 
dusting had ever been done, and not much of that. The plaster was sound, 
the intonaco firmly attached all over, and the pigment solidly incorporated 
with it in all but a few unimportant places.   The greatest 
source of trouble was rain which had repeatedly flowed from openings 
above, soaking the surface and leaving streaks of dissolved lime, 
very conspicuous even after cleaning, particularly in the "Landing 
of Columbus", "Oglethorpe and the Indians", and "Yorktown". 
Here the Architect, referring to the use of the Capitol as a 
public building, not a museum, requested some repainting to maintain decorative 
effect, rather than leaving blank, unsightly patches. 
These frescos have had no care for eighty years. With naked gas jets 
below and leaky windows above, enough to ruin wall paintings in any 
medium, they have survived, in a building long unheated in winter, hot 
and damp under the iron dome in summer.

Those whom I wish to address with this letter are for the most 
part unknown to me. It may well be that, when Rudy Pozzatti and I 
visited your country last spring, you were living and working close 
to the places we saw and the streets we walked. As American artists, 
it was natural that we would want to meet as many Soviet artists as 
possible. This letter might not have been necessary had our efforts 
to meet and talk with you been more successful. Even though we did not 
see many of your faces, it appears now quite evident that a considerable 
number of your profession heard, from those whom we had the fortune 
to encounter, that we had been in your midst. I am very pleased that 
quite a number of you found ways to communicate to me your desire to 
hear of our reactions and experiences in the U&S&S&R&. I 
can well understand your curiosity. We, ourselves, are always eager 
to know how others feel about us and the way in which we live. it is 
my hope that this written message and report will reach you through the 
good offices of the Union of Soviet Artists.   There should 
be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter. Pozzatti 
and I endeavored earnestly to record our impressions without the 
prejudice that the anxiety of our time so easily provokes. The time-span 
of little more than a month cannot entitle me to pose as an expert 
on anything I saw. Too much damage is done by "experts" who 
have spent even less time, if any at all, in the U&S&S&R&.

Nevertheless I consider it reasonable, because of my commitment 
as an artist, to assume that the rights and responsibilities of creative 
individuals are related to humanity as a whole rather than to specific 
geo-political interests. If this attitude is seriously questioned 
in the Soviet Union, it does not necessarily follow that the majority 
of the society in which I live is too aware of the necessity for 
clarity on this ethical as well as aesthetic point of view. It is 
a matter of some disappointment to me that still many of my own countrymen 
are too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the 
plight of a minority, such as artists, in any social order. I encountered 
many questions and great interest upon my return from the Soviet Union 
about my reactions to that experience. That which I found most 
profound and most disturbing appeared to evoke a curiously muted reaction. 
Almost as if I were talking about something quite unreal. Apparently 
this is not the time and the climate in which people will listen 
objectively, or at least dispassionately, to individual impressions 
of a subject which preoccupies a good deal of their waking moments. Personal 
predispositions tend to blunt the ear and, in turn, the voice 
as well. I cannot be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat 
unusual travelogue. I am equally impatient with the shrug of the 
shoulder, shake of the head of those who no longer care because they 
have known it for so long; the aggressive disbelief of those who are 
romantically lost in a semantic jungle of the word "Revolution"; 
the belligerent denunciations by the sick fanatics of ignorance who 
try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on our physical 
horizons. Difficult as it may have been at times, Pozzatti and I saw 
enough, talked to enough artists, historians and others to realize 
that the issue is quite clear. Artists and poets are the raw nerve-ends 
of humanity; they are small in number and their contribution is not 
immediately decisive in everyday life. By themselves they may not 
be able to save the life on this planet, but without them there would 
be very little left worth saving.   It cannot be said that our 
very first day in the Soviet Union turned out to be an ordinary one. 
On that cold, but bright, April day we were guests of your government 
in the reviewing stand of Red Square to witness the poeple's celebration 
for Yuri Gagarin and later on that day we attended the somewhat 
more exclusive reception for him in one of the impressive palaces 
of the Kremlin. If we thus spent our very first day in the midst of 
a large number of your people honoring a new hero and a great national 
achievement, our last day, to us at least, was equally impressive and 
very moving, even though the crowds were absent and there was almost 
complete silence. We stood under a gigantic tree in the rolling country 
just outside of Moscow looking at silent flowers on the grave of 
a Russian poet and writer who cherished the love for his country to 
the point of foregoing the highest international honor. The grave, about 
half-way between his home and the blue turrets of a small church, 
rose above the forms and spaces of gently undisciplined pastures of green, 
the sounds of birds, the silence of other graves and the casual 
paths through small forests. Just yesterday we had met and talked with 
a living writer, a contemporary of the dead poet, who is known for his 
ability of manipulating his ideas and his craft more advantageously. 
But today we were aware of only two men. One had taken a flight into 
uncharted space, in the service of science, to return as a living hero. 
The other had assumed the right to explore the equally uncharted 
space of the human spirit. The flowers on his grave attested to the 
fact that he as well was somebody's hero.   These two recollections 
form the frame around a series of experiences and sights which, 
to me at least, symbolize the extremes in the aesthetic as well as ethical 
conflict between materialism and humanism. A struggle that is 
being waged all over the world in the half-light of disinterest. The 
prevalent opinion which we encountered in a variety of expressions in 
your country denied not only the existence of this conflict but it was 
elaborated even further with an incredible semantic dexterity. The socialist 
environment, it was stated, had cross-fertilized these two extreme 
seeds and was about to produce a new plant and fruit. When I speculated 
on one such occasion that the new growth, like other mutations, 
might be unable to propagate, I was immediately accused of preaching 
racial prejudice. I could not bring myself to answer that "some 
of my best friends are non-propagating mules".   This kind of 
reasoning and logic takes a little time to get used to. After a while 
we were perhaps less surprised, but still puzzled, when a friendly 
discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and 
illogical comparisons. A chance remark about Lenin's sealed train 
brought the rejoinder that this was a myth akin to George Washington's 
cherry tree. Theories of the behavior pattern of population masses 
were compared to scientific discoveries concerning the motion-pattern 
of gaseous masses. No wonder that Pozzatti and I had at times difficulty
