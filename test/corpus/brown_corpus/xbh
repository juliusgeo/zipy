She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 
and has appeared in live television from "Captain Brassbound's 
Conversion" to "Camille". She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks 
in London, a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel 
in many states.   She is adept at skeet shooting, trout fishing, 
Afro-Cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology. 
She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony 
Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees 
of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts. She is state chairman for 
the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations. Both Miss 
Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys 
Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that 
flourishes in New Mexico.

Back in college, today's handsome Gander was the only male 
member of a Texas Tech class on food. The pretty coeds must have ogled 
him all day long- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.

Last October he gave a public speech in Washington, D&C& 
entitled "Are Women Here to Stay"? So you can see that Gerald 
G& Ramsey, director of ~SMU's food services, is not the 
ordinary type of craven, women-trodden chef. He is apt to rear back 
and claim his rights. ##

{RAMSEY}, as ~SMU's food 
wrangler, buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week. Tell 
that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden!

He also dishes up 3,000 snacks. And he operates three cafeterias 
in the Student Center, along with McElvaney Dining Hall and the 
athlete's tables.   Ramsey, 6-3, 195 and ruggedly slim, says, 
"I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me 
to cook". ##

{HE WAS IN CHARGE} of the Hockaday School 
meals from 1946 to 1950, before he moved to ~SMU. And you'll 
notice that in both places, there are acres of charming young ladies 
who with little effort spice up any chow line.   What does he feed 
his ~SMU football mastodons at the training table?   "Mostly 
meat and potatoes- they have to have that go-go-go without 
getting too fat", says Ramsey. So he hides the mayonnaise. And to 
keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress, 
he bans all highly flavored condiments. ##

{WHAT DO} the 
pretty ~SMU girls like on their plates?   "Pretty much 
hamburger, hotdogs, steak and, at night, maybe pizza", says the handsome 
food expert. "Unfortunately, there is still little demand for 
broccoli and cauliflower".   Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman, 
Henry Cabot Lodge, the King of Morocco, Clement Atlee and 
other shiny characters. Once four Tibetan monks, in their saffron robes, 
filed through the cafeteria line.   "They aren't supposed 
to look at women, you know", Ramsey recalled. "What with all 
those pretty girls around, they had a hard time". 

#CHICKEN CADILLAC# 

Use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest. Salt and pepper 
each breast. Dip in melted butter and roll in flour. Place side by 
side in a 2-inch deep baking pan. Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 
F& until lightly brown.   Add enough warmed cream, seasoned 
to taste with onion juice, to about half cover the chicken breasts. 
Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer.   While this is baking, 
saute mushrooms, fresh or canned, in butter. Sprinkle over top 
of chicken breasts. Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham 
and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.   (Leave off the 
ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac, says Ramsey.)

Contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line 
modern but has sculptured pattern, many design facets, warmth, dignity 
and an effect of utter comfort and livability.   That is the 
goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month.

Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary 
furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's, 
two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated, 
but warm look in contemporary. These two, Heritage and Drexel, 
chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece, 
but a collection of correlated designs, each of which could stand alone.

The Heritage collection, to be shown by Sanger-Harris and 
Anderson's Studio, has perhaps more different types of woods and 
decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one 
time. Called Perennian, to indicate its lasting, good today and tomorrow 
quality, the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces.

Walnut, wormy chestnut, pecan, three varieties of burl, 
hand-woven Philippine cane, ceramic tiles, marble are used to emphasize 
the feeling of texture and of permanence, the furniture to fit into 
rooms with tiled floors, brick or paneled walls, windows that bring 
in the outdoors. It is a collection with a custom-design look, offering 
simplicity with warmth, variety and vitality.   The Drexel collection, 
called Composite, to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic 
approach to decorating, a mature modern that is a variation of many 
designs.   Rounded posts give a soft, sculptured look, paneled 
doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches, 
table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia. A high-legged 
buffet provides easy-to-reach serving, a cocktail table has small snack 
tables tucked under each end, recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch 
long chest.   An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented, 
with a young, basic, functional group of chests, dressers and 
corner units and a canted headboard. The other bedroom has heavier styling, 
door-fronted dressers with acacia panels, a poster bed or a bed 
with arched acacia panels and matching mirror.   Colorful, bright 
Eastman Chromspun fabrics, with the magenta, pink and white tones 
predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite. The 
fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles. 
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite 
contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group, Composite. 
The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony, to 
set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top. See-through design of 
the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji 
flavor. To bring warmth to the dining area, golden orange tones 
are used in the fabrics.   Dignity and comfort, in a contemporary 
manner, reflecting the best aspects of today's design, with substance 
and maturity, keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage. Center 
panel, hand-screened wood, actually is a back of one of the tall 
bookcases. Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper 
and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander 
Smith carpet in all wool loop pile.

The Vagabonds are "on the road" again. Members are on their 
way to Saledo, not by stage coach, but in air-conditioned cars.

This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn 
and adjoining country club, Saledo, for festivities. Invitations 
have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov& and 
Mrs& Price Daniel.   Stagecoach Days is the theme for the 
weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail. ##

{THE GET-TOGETHER} 
Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool, 
and an orchestra will play for dancing.   Guests will wear costumes 
typical of the Chisholm Trail Days. Ginghams and calico will 
be popular dress for the women. The men will be in western attire, 
including Stetsons and colored vests. ##

{DECORATING} 
the ballroom 
will be the yellow rose of Texas, in tall bushes; bluebonnets 
and stagecoach silhouettes. There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet 
girl with eyes that flash at the guests.   Mr& and Mrs& 
Phil G& Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip. Committee members 
aiding them in planning the entertainment are ~Messrs and ~Mmes 
Roy McKee, George McElyee, Jack Fanning, W& H& Roquemore 
and Joe Darrow. ##

{THE TRAVEL CLUB} is comprised of 
75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto "Go Somewhere, Anywhere, 
Everywhere". Their activities will be climaxed in the spring 
of 1962 when they go to Europe.   In the past, the men and women 
have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica, buses to Mineral 
Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and 
Galveston.   Four parties are given a year. Two of these are 
in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.   Serving 
on the club's board are ~Mmes R& P& Anderson, president; 
A& F& Schmalzried, secretary; W& H& Roquemore, 
treasurer, and the following chairmen: ~Mmes McKee, publicity; 
Lawrence B& Jones, yearbook, and Sam Laughlin, scrapbook.

A cooky with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 
for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-Off 
Tuesday.   Mrs& Alice H& Reese, wife of an engineer and 
mother of a 23-year-old son, was awarded the top prize at a luncheon 
in the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Mrs& Reese entered 10 past bake-offs 
before she got into the finals.   Second grand prize 
of $5,000 went to Mrs& Clara L& Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee 
ring, a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze. 

#MOTHER 
OF FIVE#

Mrs& Oliver is mother of five children and wife 
of a machinist. She lives in Wellsville, Mo&.   Mrs& Reese 
baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals. 
And the third time was the charm.   She dreamed up the cooky recipe, 
tried it, liked it and entered it in the contest. The second baking 
was for photographing when told she was a finalist. The third time 
was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical 
eyes and tongues of judges.

Mr& and Mrs& Joseph R& Bolker will give a dinner 
on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs& Norman Chandler, 
chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee, and 
Mr& Chandler.   Mr& Bolker heads a group within the building 
and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural 
center for the performing arts.   A feature of the party will 
be a presentation by Welton Becket, center architect, of color slides 
and renderings of the three-building complex. 

#FOLIAGE WILL GLOW 
AT FORMAL FALL PARTY#

Fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los 
Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening. 
More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in 
the spring.   Among those with reservations are Messrs& and 
Mmes& William A& Thompson, Van Cott Niven, A& B& Cox, 
David Bricker, Samuel Perry and Robert D& Stetson. 
Others are Drs& and Mmes& Alfred Robbins, and J& Lafe Ludwig
