economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped 
sliding and that it should start going upward from this point. He 
is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.

The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail 
sales. February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the 
first pickup since last October, although it's still 1.5 per cent 
off from February 1960.   Corroborating Mr& Hodges' figures 
was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase 
in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4. 
In Newark, for example, this gain was put at 26 per cent above the 
year-earlier level. Of course, some of the credit for the sale boost 
must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter 
comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.   Another optimistic 
sign, this one from the Labor Department, was the report that 
the long rise in unemployment compensation payments "was interrupted 
for the first time in the week ending Feb& 25". Initial claims 
for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week 
ending March 4.   Mr& Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook 
that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes. 
Well, we can't have everything. Prosperity for the whole nation 
is certainly preferred to a tax cut. @ 

#IN NEW JERSEY, TOO# 
@ NEW JERSEY folk need not be told of the builder's march to 
the sea, for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles 
of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that 
remain. Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic attraction 
for exotic herons, is threatened, but the battlefront extends 
far beyond our state.   Against the dramatic fight being waged 
for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline, the tiny tract 
at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant. But Interior Secretary Udall 
warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few 
surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment 
of all as public preserves.   The move for establishment 
of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod, from Provincetown 
to Chatham, is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest 
in that area. But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape 
is of more than regional concern, for the automobile age has made it the 
recreation spot of people from all over the country.   By comparison, 
Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable, 
for aside from the Audubon Society, they are mostly the snowy, 
common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana, green, little blue and 
black-crowned herons who nest and feed there. But there is hope, for 
Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the 
kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its 
park space.   The desirability of preserving such places as the 
Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every 
year. Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is 
growing. But that heritage is shrinking even faster. @ 

#NO JOYRIDE# 
@ MUCH of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps 
may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent 
Shriver, the head corpsman. Anybody who is expecting a joyride 
should, according to Mr& Shriver, get off the train right now.

First of all, the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling. 
It will be a 16-hour training day. Then off to a remote place in 
an underdeveloped country where the diet, culture, language and living 
conditions will be different. And the pay, of course, will be nil.

Despite all this, the idea apparently has captured the imagination 
of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by 
the response than anybody else.

The study of the St& Louis area's economic prospects prepared 
for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and 
reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St& Louis Survey 
of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-Illinois 
countryside.   St& Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing 
and in some places stagnant mid-continent region. Slackened 
regional demand for St& Louis goods and services reflects the region's 
relative lack of purchasing power. Not all St& Louis industries, 
of course, have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood. 
But for those which do, the slow growth of the area has a retarding 
effect on the metropolitan core. The city has a stake in stimulating 
growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern 
Illinois.   Gov& Dalton's new Commerce and Industry 
Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective 
effort to attract new industry. That is one approach. Another 
would be to take the advice of Dr& Elmer Ellis, president of 
the University of Missouri, and provide for an impartial professional 
analysis of Missouri's economy. He says the state, in order to 
proceed with economic development, must develop an understanding of how 
the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the 
national economy. @   The research center of the University's 
School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake 
the analysis Dr& Ellis has been talking about. He and Dean 
John W& Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at 
a recent conference. The University can make a valuable contribution 
to the state's economic development through such a study. 
In Southern Illinois, the new federal program of help to economically 
depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth. The Carbondale 
Industrial Development Corp& has obtained a $500,000 loan 
to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate 
production that will provide 500 new jobs. Carbondale is in the 
Herrin-Murphysboro-West 
Frankfort labor market, where unemployment 
has been substantially higher than the national average. The Federal 
program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed 
areas, and in the long run that will benefit St& Louis as 
well. @

Politics-ridden St& Clair county in Illinois presents 
another piece of the problem of metropolitan development. More industrial 
acreage lies vacant in St& Clair county than in any other 
jurisdiction in the St& Louis area. The unstable political situation 
there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side.

And then there is St& Louis county, where the Democratic 
leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning, 
of the important relationship between proper land use and economic 
growth. St& Louis county under its present leadership also has 
largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform, and permitted 
parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests. Some 
plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St& Louis 
county doesn't want industry, and so they avoid the area, and more 
jobs are lost.   Metropolitan St& Louis's relatively slow 
rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political, business, 
civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi. Without 
a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy, there will 
not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters, and St& 
Louis will slip into second-class status. 

#AN EXCESS OF ZEAL# 

Many of our very best friends are reformers. Still we must confess 
that sometimes some of them go too far. Take, for example, the reformers 
among New York City's Democrats. Having whipped Mr& De 
Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall, 
they have changed the name to Chatham Hall. Even though headquarters 
actually have been moved into the Chatham building, do they believe 
that they can make the new name stick?   Granted that the Tammany 
name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political 
shame, the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to 
their credit. But it is tradition rather than the record which balks 
at the expunging of the Tammany name. After all, it goes back to the 
days in which sedition was not un-American, the days in which the Sons 
of St& Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force 
and violence- the British government that is.   Further, do 
our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent 
to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo? They will- when they 
give up the donkey and the elephant. Instead of attempting the impossible, 
why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's 
stripes are not black? That might go over. 

#THE FAGET CASE#

The 
White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official, 
Col& Mariano Faget, 
from his preposterous position as interrogator 
of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service.   The 
Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds. The Kennedy 
Administration had assured anti-Castro Cubans that it would have 
nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista. Using a Batista 
man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic 
forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro.   Moreover, 
Col& Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be 
useful in "screening" Castro agents; the Colonel fled to the 
friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized 
power. And while he had headed Batista's anti-Communist 
section, 
the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open 
opponents who were alleged to be Communists.   Responsibility 
for the Faget appointment rests with Gen& J& M& swing, an 
Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service. Gen& Swing 
has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the 
prerogatives of his office. His official term expired last summer. 
Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend, 
Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania, at a moment when the Kennedy 
Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it 
could get.   Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration 
matters, but he has announced plans to retire in 1962. At that 
point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen& 
Swing. The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration 
should not have to repeat. 

#MR& EISENHOWER, POLITICIAN#

As 
President, Dwight D& Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from 
the strife of partisan politics. As a former President, however, Mr& 
Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during 
a New York Republican rally, and generally missed his target.

Mr& Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost 
by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a 
"juvenile experiment" and to suggest sending a Corps member to the 
moon. This was juvenile ridicule. Nowhere did the speaker recognize 
the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad. His 
words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name 
to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal 
of international understanding.   The former President blithely 
ignored recent history in speaking of "dollarette" dollars under 
Kennedy Administration fiscal policies. It was the Eisenhower Administration 
which produced the largest peacetime deficit.   Finally, 
Mr& Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington. 
This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis, when President Eisenhower
