to be? Considering the nature of man, and the conditions for 
happiness, this can hardly be so".   The ambiguities suggested 
above stem from a more basic difficulty in Fromm's style of thought. 
He seems to use the term alienation in two different ways. Sometimes 
he uses it as a subjective, descriptive term, and sometimes as an 
objective, diagnostic one. That is, sometimes it is used to <describe 
felt> human misery, and other times it is postulated to <explain unfelt> 
anxiety and discontent. The failure to keep these two usages 
distinct presents hazards to the reader. It also permits Fromm to do 
some dubious things with empirical findings. When alienation is used 
as an objective and diagnostic category, for example, it becomes clear 
that Fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation goes far 
toward conquering it. (He in effect does say this in his discussion of 
the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist.) Starting from this, 
and accepting his estimate of the iniquities of modern society, it 
would follow that the really disturbing evidence of alienation would 
be that of a work-satisfaction survey which reported widespread, stated 
worker satisfaction, rather than widespread, stated worker dissatisfaction.

The point is that in a system such as Fromm's which 
recognizes unconscious motivations, and which rests on certain ethical 
absolutes, empirical data can be used to support whatever proposition 
the writer is urging at the moment. Thus, in the example cited above 
Fromm rests his whole case on the premise that the workers are being 
deprived unconsciously, unknowingly, of fulfillment, and then supports 
this with survey data reporting conscious, experienced frustrations. 
He has his cake and eats it too: if the workers say they are dissatisfied, 
this shows conscious alienation; if they say they are satisfied, 
this shows unconscious alienation. This sort of manipulation is 
especially troublesome in Fromm's work because, although his system 
is derived largely from certain philosophic convictions, he asserts 
that it 
is based on empirical findings drawn both from social science and 
from his own consulting room. While the "empirical psychoanalytic" 
label which Fromm claims sheds no light on the validity of his underlying 
philosophy, it does increase the marketability of his product.

The final example of the failure to use available evidence, 
though evidence of a different kind from that which has so far been considered, 
comes from Fromm's treatment of some other writers who have 
dealt with the same themes. In a brief chapter dealing with "Various 
Other Diagnoses", he quotes isolated passages from some writers 
whose views seem to corroborate his own, and finds it "most remarkable 
that a critical view of twentieth-century society was already held 
by a number of thinkers living in the nineteenth **h". He finds 
it equally "remarkable that their critical diagnosis and prognosis 
should have so much in common among themselves and with the critics of 
the twentieth century". There is nothing remarkable about this at 
all. It is largely a matter of finding passages that suit one's purposes. 
There is a difference between evidence and illustration, and Fromm's 
citation of the other diagnosticians fits the latter category. 
Glance at the list: Burckhardt, Tolstoy, Proudhon, Thoreau, 
London, Marx, Tawney, Mayo, Durkheim, Tannenbaum, Mumford, A& 
R& Heron, Huxley, Schweitzer, and Einstein. This is a delightfully 
motley collection. One can make them say the same thing only by 
not listening to them very carefully and hearing only what one wants 
to hear. The method of selection Fromm uses achieves exactly that. Furthermore, 
the list is interesting for its omissions. It omits, for 
example, practically the whole line of great nineteenth century English 
social critics, nearly all the great writers whose basic position 
is religious, and all those who are with more or less accuracy called 
Existentialists. Of course, the list also excludes all writers who are 
fairly "optimistic" about the modern situation; these, almost 
by definition, are spokesmen for an alienated ideology. It is not hard 
to find that concurrence of opinion which Fromm finds so remarkable 
when you ignore all who hold a different opinion.   Turning from 
these problems of the use of evidence, one meets another type of difficulty 
in Fromm's analysis, which is his loose and ambiguous use 
of certain important terms. One such instance has already been presented: 
his use of alienation. The only other one I shall mention here 
is his use of the term capitalism.   For Fromm, capitalism is 
the enemy, the root of all evil. It is of course useful to have a sovereign 
cause in one's social criticism, for it makes diagnosis and 
prescription much easier than they might otherwise be.

If one characteristic distinguishes <Boris Godunov>, it is 
the consistency with which every person on the stage- including the 
chorus- comes alive in the music. Much of this lifelike quality results 
from Mussorgsky's care in basing his vocal line on natural speech 
inflections. In this he followed a path that led back to the very 
source of opera; such composers as Monteverdi, Lully and Purcell, 
with the same goal in mind, had developed styles of recitative sensitively 
attuned to their own languages. Through long experimentation 
in his songs, Mussorgsky developed a Russian recitative as different 
from others as the language itself. Giving most of his musical continuity 
to the orchestra, he lets the speech fall into place as if by coincidence, 
but controlling the pace and emphasis of the words. 
The moments of sung melody, in the usual sense, come most often when 
the character is actually supposed to be singing, as in folk songs and 
liturgical chants. Otherwise Mussorgsky reserves his vocal melodies 
for prolonged expressions of emotion- Boris' first monologue, for 
example. Even then, the flexibility of the phrasing suggests that 
the word comes first in importance.   Aside from Boris himself, 
one need but examine the secondary roles to place Mussorgsky among 
the masters of musical portraiture. Even those who appear in only one 
or two scenes are full personalities, defined with economical precision. 
Consider the four monks who figure prominently in the action: 
Pimen, Varlaam, Missail and the Jesuit Rangoni. Under no circumstances 
could we mistake one for the other; each musical setting has 
an individual touch.   Pimen is an old man, weak in body- his 
voice rarely rises to a full <forte>- but firm and clear of mind. 
His calmness offers contrast to Grigori's youthful excitement. A 
quiet but sturdy theme, somewhat folklike in character, appears whenever 
the old monk speaks of the history he is recording or of his own past 
life: @   This theme comes to represent the outer world, the 
realm of battles and banquets- seen from a distance, quite distinct 
from the quieter spiritual life in the monastery. It changes and develops 
according to the text; it introduces Pimen when he comes before 
Boris in the last act. Once he has been identified, however, a 
new melody is used to accompany his narrative, a bleak motif with barren 
octaves creating a rather ancient effect: @   An imaginative 
storyteller, Pimen takes on the character he describes, as if he 
were experiencing the old shepherd's blindness and miraculous cure. 
Here the composer uses a favorite device of his, the intensification 
of the mood through key relationships. The original ~D minor seems 
to symbolize blindness, inescapable in spite of all attempts to move 
away from it. As the child addresses the shepherd in a dream, light- 
in the form of the major mode- begins to appear, and at the moment 
of the miracle we hear a clear and shining ~D major.   Varlaam 
and Missail always appear together and often sing together, in a straightforward, 
rhythmically 
vigorous idiom that distinguishes them from 
the more subtle and well-educated Pimen. Their begging song might 
easily be a folk melody: @   The same could be said for the 
song to which they make their entrance in the final scene. Apparently 
their origin is humble, their approach to life direct and unsophisticated. 
Whatever learning they may have had in their order doesn't disturb 
them now.   Missail is the straight man, not very talkative, 
mild-mannered when he does speak. Varlaam is loud, rowdy, uninhibited 
in his pleasures and impatient with anyone who is not the same. A 
rough <ostinato> figure, heard first in the introduction to the inn 
scene, characterizes him amusingly and reappears whenever he comes into 
the action: @   The Song of Kazan, in which this figure 
becomes a wild-sounding accompaniment, fills in the picture of undisciplined 
high spirits. The phrasing is irregular, and the abrupt key 
changes have a primitive forcefulness. (We can imagine how they startled 
audiences of the 1870's.)   Varlaam's music begins to ramble 
as he feels the effects of the wine, but he pulls himself together 
when the need arises. Both monks respond to the guard's challenge 
with a few phrases of their begging song; a clever naturalistic touch 
is Varlaam's labored reading of the warrant. As the knack gradually 
comes back to him, his rhythm becomes steadier, with the rigid monotony 
of an unskilled reader. For the only time in the opera, words 
are <not> set according to their natural inflection; to do so would 
have spoiled the dramatic point of the scene.   Musically and 
dramatically, Rangoni is as far removed from the conventional monk as 
Varlaam. His music shows a sensuality coupled with an eerie quality 
that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with Dappertutto in Offenbach's 
<Hoffman>. His speech shows none of the native accent of the 
Russian characters; in spite of the Italian name, he sounds French. 
His personality appears more striking by contrast with Marina, who 
is- perhaps purposely- rather superficially characterized.

Rangoni's first entrance is a musical shock, a sudden open fifth 
in a key totally unrelated to what has preceded it. The effect is as 
if he had materialized out of nowhere. He speaks quietly, concealing 
his authority beneath a smooth humility, just as the shifting harmonies 
that accompany him all but hide the firm pedal point beneath them. 
He addresses Marina with great deference, calling her "Princess" 
at first; it is only after he has involved her emotions in his scheme 
that he uses her given name, placing himself by implication in the 
position of a solicitous father.   Curiously, this scene is a close 
parallel to one that Verdi was writing at the same time, the scene 
between Amonasro and Aida. Rangoni and Amonasro have the same 
purpose- forcing the girl to charm the man she loves into serving her 
country's cause- and their tactics are much the same. Rangoni begins 
by describing the sad state of the Church; this brings a reaction 
of distress from Marina. The music becomes ethereal as he calls 
up a vision of her own sainthood: it is she, he tells her, who can 
bring the truth to Russia and convert the heretics. As if in a trance, 
she repeats his words- then realizes, with a shock, her own audacity. 
This is no assignment for a frivolous girl, she assures him.

Now Rangoni comes to the point, and we hear, for the first time, 
a long, downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic 
motif of his sinister power. It is a phrase as arresting as a magician's 
gesture, with a piquant turn of harmony giving an effect of strangeness. 
Another theme, sinuously chromatic, appears as he directs her 
to gain power over Grigori by any means, even at the cost of her honor. 
Coming from a priest, the music sounds as odd as the advice: 
@   Marina rebels at this suggestion. Her pride is as much at 
stake as her virtue; she is the unattainable beauty, the princess who 
turns away suitors by the dozen. Indignantly she denounces Rangoni 
for his evil thoughts and orders him to leave her.   At once the 
Jesuit pulls out all the stops. To music of a menacing darkness, 
he describes the powers of Satan gaining control of the girl, poisoning 
her soul with pride and destroying her beauty. The combined threat 
of hell-fire and ugliness is too much for her, and she falls terrified 
at his feet. With another sudden change of mood, he is again calm and 
protective, exhorting her to trust and obey him as God's spokesman- 
and the chromatic scale descends in ominous contradiction. Whatever 
the source of Rangoni's power, Marina is his captive now; we 
are reminded of this at the end of the next scene, when his theme cuts 
through the warmth of the love duet, again throwing a chill over the 
atmosphere.   The most unusual feature of <Boris>, however, 
is the use of the greatest character of all, the chorus. This is the 
real protagonist of the drama; the conflict is not Boris versus Grigori 
or Shuiski or even the ghost of the murdered child, but Boris 
versus the Russian people. Mussorgsky makes this quite clear by the 
extent to which choral scenes propel the action. Boris' first entrance
