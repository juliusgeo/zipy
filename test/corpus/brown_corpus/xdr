
_PURPLE NOON:_ This French 
film, set in Italy, is a summertime splurge in shock and terror all 
shot in lovely sunny scenery- so breath-taking that at times you 
almost forget the horrors the movie is dealing with. But slowly they 
take over as Alain Delon (LIFE, Sept& 15), playing a sometimes 
appealing but always criminal boy, casually tells a rich and foot-loose 
American that he is going to murder him, then does it even while 
the American is trying to puzzle out how Delon expects to profit from 
the act.

_NORMA._ Callas devotees will have good 
reason to do their customary cart wheels over a new and complete stereo 
version of the Bellini opera. Maria goes all out as a Druid princess 
who gets two-timed by a Roman big shot. By turns, her beautifully 
sung Norma is fierce, tender, venomous and pitiful. The tenor lead, 
Franco Corelli, and La Scala cast under Maestro Tullio Serafin 
are all first rate. @ _JEREMIAH PEABODY'S POLYUNSATURATED QUICK 
DISSOLVING FAST ACTING PLEASANT TASTING GREEN AND PURPLE PILLS._ 
In a raucous take-off on radio commercials, Singer Ray Stevens hawks 
a cure-all for neuritis, neuralgia, head-cold distress, beriberi, 
overweight, fungus, mungus and water on the knee. @ 
Of the nation's eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number 
have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat- 
at least in that broad balmy region that lies below America's 
belt line. Waterways are busy right now from the Virginia capes 
to the Texas coast. There true yachtsmen often find November winds 
steadier, the waters cooler, the fish hungrier, and rivers more pleasant- 
less turbulence and mud, and fewer floating logs.   More and 
more boats move overland on wheels (1.8 million trailers are now in 
use) and Midwesterners taking long weekends can travel south with their 
craft. In the Southwest, the fall brings out flotillas of boatsmen 
who find the summer too hot for comfort. And on northern shores indomitable 
sailors from Long Island to Lake Michigan will beat around 
the buoys in dozens of frostbite races. Some pleasant fall cruising 
country is mapped out below. 

#BOATING#


_WEST COAST._ Pleasure 
boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp 
breezes bring out craft of every size on every kind of water- ocean, 
lake and reservoir. Shore facilities are enormous- Los Angeles 
harbors 5,000 boats, and Long Beach 3,000- but marinas are crowded 
everywhere. New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa del Rey, 
Ventura, Dana Point, Oceanside and Mission Bay.   Inland, 
outboard motorists welcome cooler weather and the chance to buzz over 
Colorado River sandbars and Lake Mead. Newest small-boat playground 
is the Salton Sea, a once-dry desert sinkhole which is now a 
salty lake 42 miles long and 235 feet below sea level. On Nov& 11, 
12, racers will drive their flying shingles in 5-mile laps over its 500-mile 
speedboat course. In San Francisco Bay, winds are gusty and 
undependable 
during this season. A sailboat may have a bone in her teeth 
one minute and lie becalmed the next. But regattas are scheduled 
right up to Christmas. The Corinthian Yacht Club in Tiburon launches 
its winter races Nov& 5. _GULF COAST._ Hurricane Carla damaged 
70% of the marinas in the Galveston-Port Aransas area but 
fuel service is back to normal, and explorers can roam as far west as 
Port Isabel on the Mexican border. Sailing activity is slowed down 
by Texas northers, but power cruisers can move freely, poking into the 
San Jacinto, Trinity and Brazos rivers (fine tarpon fishing in 
the Brazos) or pushing eastward to the pirate country of Barataria. 
Off Grand Isle, yachters often visit the towering oil rigs. The Mississippi 
Sound leads into a protected waterway running about 200 miles 
from Pascagoula to Apalachicola. _LOWER MISSISSIPPI._ Memphis 
stinkpotters like McKellar Lake, inside the city limits, and sailors 
look for autumn winds at Arkabutla Lake where fall racing is 
now in progress. River cruising for small craft is ideal in November. 
At New Orleans, 25-mile-square Lake Pontchartrain has few squalls 
and year-long boating. Marinas are less plush than the Florida type 
but service is good and Creole cooking better. _~TVA LAKES._ 
Ten thousand twisty miles of shoreline frame the 30-odd lakes in the 
vast Tennessee River system that loops in and out of seven states. 
When dam construction began in 1933, fewer than 600 boats used these 
waters; today there are 48,500.

{A YEAR} ago it was bruited that the primary character 
in Erich 
Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso 
de Portago, the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia 
automobile race of 1957. If this was in fact Mr& Remarque's 
intention he has achieved a notable failure. Clerfayt of "Heaven 
Has No Favorites" resembles Portago only in that he is male and 
a race-driver- quite a bad race-driver, whereas Portago was a good 
one. He is a dull, unformed, and aimless person; the twelfth Marquis 
de Portago was intelligent, purposeful, and passionate.   One 
looked forward to Mr& Remarque's ninth book if only because 
not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile 
racing, as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised. Unhappily, 
"Heaven Has No Favorites" does not alter the record except to 
add one more bad book to the list.   Mr& Remarque's conception 
of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble. He proposed throwing 
together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced 
on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery. His 
treatment of it is something else. His heroine chooses to die- the 
price of recovery, years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium, being 
higher than she wishes to pay. Her lover precedes her in death, at 
the wheel, and presumably he too has chosen. Between the first meeting 
of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement, Mr& Remarque 
has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse, some demure 
and rather fetching love-making, pleasant talk about some of the 
countryside and restaurants of Europe, and a modicum of automobile racing. 
The ramblings on life, death, and the wonder of it all are distressing; 
the love-making, perhaps because it is pale and low-key when 
one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness, is 
often charming; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality.

This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and 
it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author 
drawn Clerfayt as, say, a tournament golfer. Hazards to life and 
limb on the golf course, while existent, are actuarially insignificant. 
Race-drivers, on the other hand, are quite often killed on the circuit, 
and since it was obviously Mr& Remarque's intention to establish 
automobile racing as life in microcosm, one might reasonably have 
expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques 
but of mores and attitudes. He does not. The jacket biography describes 
him as a former racing driver, and he may indeed have been, although 
I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records 
or the literature. Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal. The 
book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary 
for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities 
of racing. The necessity is not clear to me, and, in any case, 
to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car, 
which, or whom, he calls "Giuseppe", parked "on the Place Vendome 
sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked around 
him" is not a liberty; it is an absurdity.   But it is in the 
matter of preoccupation with death, which is the primary concern of 
the book, that Remarque's failure is plainest. Clerfayt is neurotic, 
preoccupied, and passive. To be human, he believes, is to seek one's 
own destruction: the Freudian "death-wish" cliche inevitably 
cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers. In point of fact, 
the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent, healthy 
technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the 
passion they feel for the work by which they live. A Clerfayt may moon 
on about the face of Death in the cockpit; a Portago could say, 
as he did say to me, "If I die tomorrow, still I have had twenty-eight 
wonderful years; but I shan't die tomorrow; I'll live 
to be 105".   Clerfayt, transported, may think of the engine 
driving his car as "a mystical beast under the hood". The Italian 
master Piero Taruffi, no less sensitive, knows twice the ecstasy 
though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles 
an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae. Clerfayt, 
driving, 
sees himself "a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell"; 
the Briton Stirling Moss, one of the greatest <virtuosi> of all 
time, believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related 
to ballet.   Errors in technical terminology suggest that 
the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything 
Mr& Remarque hoped to tell us.   However, my principal 
objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers, 
pilots, submariners, atomic researchers, and all the machine-masters 
of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.

{THE WEST} is leaderless, according to this book. In 
contrast, 
the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev, Tito, 
and Mao. Against this invincible determination to communize the 
whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals 
and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common 
good of all.   It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that 
in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really 
care about democracy or Christianity; about 30 per cent call themselves 
Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered 
respectable, and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and 
believers in democracy.   But these Western countries do care 
about themselves. Each feels intensely national. If, say, the Russians 
intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub, then Tom Jones 
would fight the Commies. But he would fight for his own liberty rather 
than for any abstract principle connected with it- such as "cause". 
For all practical purposes, the West stands disunited, undedicated, 
and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.   With 
this barrage, Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the 
blunderings of the West. Never given to mincing words, he places heavy 
blame upon the faulty, uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly 
America. At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed 
from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention 
to the creation of a welfare state. With Britain looking inward, overseas 
problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United 
States.   Montgomery believes that she started well. "America 
gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend 
and foe alike". She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into 
prosperity, but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace. 
America has divided more than she has united the West. The reasons 
are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with 
dollars, and that she compulsively strives to be liked. However, she 
really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by 
a quality of leadership that is basically needed.   But the greater 
reason for fumbling, stumbling American leadership is due to the 
shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor. 
"They are determined", Montgomery writes, "not to be surprised 
again, and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not 
only unnecessary, but also creates nervousness **h among other nations 
in the Western Alliance- not to mention such great suspicions among 
the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful 
coexistence or disarmament is not possible".   The net result
