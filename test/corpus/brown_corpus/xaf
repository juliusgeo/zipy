"and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital 
shopping needs of the community".

Liberals and conservatives in both parties- Democratic and 
Republican- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties, 
George H& Reama, nationally known labor-management expert, said 
here yesterday.   Mr& Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence 
at its luncheon at the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel that about 
half of the people in the country want the "welfare" type of government 
and the other half want a free enterprise system. He suggested 
that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull 
at the right lever for him on election day.   He said he was "confessing 
that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910". 
That, he added, was when he was "a very young man, a machinist and 
toolmaker by trade.   "That was before I studied law. Some 
of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist 
Party. The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist 
track. He steered me to the right track- the free enterprise track".

He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party 
called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of 
all resources. He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever 
gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to 
pass under both major parties.   Mr& Reama, who retired as vice 
president of the American Screw Co& in 1955 said, "Both parties 
in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth 
in the gross national product- but neither told us how to achieve it".

He said he favors wage increases for workers- "but manufacturers 
are caught in a profit squeeze"- and raises should only 
come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.

Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy, 
Mr& Reama said: "A Socialist is a person who believes 
in dividing everything he does not own". Mr& Reama, far from 
really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.

A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston 
taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped 
will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.

William A& Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group 
of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right 
hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council 
President Raymond Fortin Sr&.   The law which governs 
home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the 
chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures 
within 10 days and Mr& Martinelli happens to hold that post.

Mr& Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough 
signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter 
and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 
days. He explained that by law the council must establish procedures 
for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers 
completes its work.   A difference of opinion arose between Mr& 
Martinelli and John P& Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact 
manner in which the vote is handled. Mr& Martinelli has, in recent 
weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called 
for the vote, while Mr& Bourcier said that a special election 
might be called instead.   Mr& Bourcier said that he had consulted 
several Superior Court justices in the last week and received 
opinions favoring both procedures. He assured Mr& Martinelli and 
the council that he would study the correct method and report back to 
the council as soon as possible.   Mr& Martinelli said yesterday 
that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to 
plan further strategy in the charter movement. He said that the group 
has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but 
that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.

"After inspiring this, I think we should certainly follow through 
on it", he declared. "It has become our responsibility and I 
hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement". 
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members 
of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan 
ballot for posts on the charter commission.   "Our most immediate 
goal is to increase public awareness of the movement", he indicated, 
"and to tell them what this will mean for the town". He expects 
that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled 
during the last week in September.   Some opposition to the home 
rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the 
town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home 
rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter. 
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.

Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter 
was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain 
signatures under what were termed "false pretenses". Several signers 
affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax 
increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly 
and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town 
take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.

Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty 
to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may 
be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.

Council president Frank SanAntonio said yesterday 
he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A& 
Abatuno to draft the ordinance.   At the last session of the 
General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance 
as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective. 
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.

At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District 
Court for disposition. Local police have hesitated to prosecute them 
because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense. 

_PLAINFIELD_- James P& Mitchell and Sen& Walter H& Jones 
~R-Bergen, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign 
issue a remark by Richard J& Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate, that the ~GOP is "Campaigning on the carcass 
of Eisenhower Republicanism".   Mitchell was for using it, Jones 
against, and Sen& Wayne Dumont Jr& ~R-Warren did not 
mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke 
at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel. 
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield 
Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains 
Country Club. It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in 
Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.

Hughes said Monday, "It is the apparent intention of 
the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower 
Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood 
congealed after Eisenhower retired. Now he's gone, the Republican 
Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the 
people of the state". Sunday he had added, "We can love Eisenhower 
the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president **h but 
there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership".

Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue 
in the primary and the fall campaign. "How can a man with any degree 
of common decency charge this"? he asked. The former secretary 
of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican "and proud 
to have absorbed his philosophy" while working in his adminstration.

Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's 
Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism 
was a dead issue. 

#REGRETS ATTACK#

Jones said he regretted Hughes 
had made a personal attack on a past president. "He is wrong to 
inject Eisenhower into this campaign", he said, "because the primary 
is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing 
an old national campaign".   The audience last night did 
not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.

Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary. He 
then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign. State 
aid to schools, the continuance of railroad passenger service, the proper 
uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority, and 
making New Jersey attractive to new industry. 

#DECRIES JOBLESSNESS# 

Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said 
the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate 
"Must share the blame for this". Nothing that Plainfield 
last year had lost the Mack Truck Co& plant, he said industry will 
not come into this state until there is tax reform.   "But 
I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time", Mitchell 
said.   Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited to 
eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions, saved his barbs 
for Mitchell. He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government 
in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for 
aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises.   "He 
calls for help while saying he is against centralization, but you 
can't have it both ways", Jones said. The state is now faced with 
the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities, real 
estate or motor vehicles, he said, "and I challenge Mitchell to 
tell the people where he stands on the tax issue". 

#DEFENDS IKE# 

Earlier, Mitchell said in a statement:   "I think that all 
Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President 
Eisenhower by Richard J& Hughes. His reference to 'discredited 
carcass' or 'tattered remains' of the president's leadership 
is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest 
war in all history, to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by 
the American people as president of the United States, and who has 
been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the 
free 
nations.   "I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking 
a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and 
bad taste.   "Such a vicious statement can only have its origin 
in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known 
by condemning a man of world stature. It can only rebound to Mr& 
Hughes' discredit". 

#SEES JONES AHEAD#

Sen& Charles W& 
Sandman, ~R-Cape May, said today Jones will run well ahead 
of his ~GOP opponents for the gubernatorial nomination. Sandman, 
state campaign chairman for Jones, was addressing a meeting in the 
Military Park Hotel, Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign 
managers for Jones.   Sandman told the gathering that reports 
from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones
