The <Poetics>, in affirming that all human arts are "modes 
of imitation", gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than 
did Plato. But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented 
it by describing in the <Poetics> what kinds of character and 
action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and 
important human truths. For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis, 
in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of 
expressing the character of fundamental reality.   The central 
concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called <Mimesis> 
is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation (based upon 
a recognition of levels of truth) to a Christian theory of imitation 
in which the levels are dissolved. Following the theme of Incarnation 
in the Gospels, the Christian artist and critic sees in the most 
commonplace and ordinary events "figures" of divine power and reality. 
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation 
in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent. 
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement 
of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama. The artist, unlike 
the philosopher, is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified 
high levels of abstraction. He is the conveyor of a sacred reality 
by which he has been grasped. I have chosen to use the word "mimesis" 
in its Christian rather than its classic implications and 
to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological 
expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the direct consequence 
of involvement in historical experience, which are not reserved, 
as in the Greek mind, only to moments of theoretical reflection.

In the first instance, "mimesis" is here used to mean the 
recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms 
of abstract ideas or conventional designations. By "image" is meant 
not only a visual presentation, but also remembered sensations of any 
of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined 
therewith. This is the primary function of the imagination operating 
in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images 
were first appropriated. Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to 
the actual re-living of experience, in which the imagining person recovers 
through images something of the force and depth characteristic 
of experience itself. The images themselves, like their counterparts 
in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately; 
they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities 
and a unique relatedness to one another. They bring an inextricable 
component of value within themselves, with attractions and repulsions 
native to their own quality. As in experience one is seized by 
given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in 
value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation 
of images. Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism 
or realism in the conventional sense. A word taken in its dictionary 
meaning, a photographic image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing 
of a "scene" tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote 
such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without 
the incitement of value feelings. Similarly experience itself can 
be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues 
for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential 
field. A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection 
to a sense of immediacy.   The mimetic character of the 
imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation 
of artistic forms and materials. When words can be used in a more fresh 
and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and 
sounds, when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape 
all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of 
themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude of attention, all 
this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes 
upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance. These 
are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self 
and thrusts the self into decision and choice. The presence of genuine 
mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work 
demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely 
understood.   Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain 
presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which 
require some exposition before the main argument can proceed. Experience 
is not seen, as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting 
us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space 
and 
registering their character, movements, and changes on the <tabula 
rasa> of an uninvolved intellect. Neither is primary experience understood 
according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing 
is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing 
their responses in the appropriate sense organs. Primary feelings 
of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects 
(houses, trees, implements, etc&) nor a collection of isolated and 
neutral sensory qualities. In contrast to all this, primary data are 
data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.   The 
most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings, both positive 
and negative: a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment 
into oneself; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other 
part. These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers 
in which one is involved, some working for one's good, others threatening 
ill. Gone is the <tabula rasa> of the mind. In its place 
is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive 
or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined 
by constellations of process in which one is caught.   The principal 
defender of this view of primary experience as "causal efficacy" 
is Alfred North Whitehead. Our most elemental and unavoidable 
impressions, he says, are those of being involved in a large arena of 
powers which have a longer past than our own, which are interrelated 
in a vast movement through the present toward the future. We feel the 
quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening. 
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors 
of judgment in these apprehensions of value, but the apprehensions themselves 
are the primary stuff of experience. It takes a great deal 
of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger 
unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a 
collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern, 
devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far 
as they present themselves for inspection. Whitehead is here questioning 
David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience; he 
is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's 
presupposition 
that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from 
causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually 
imputed to the world, not directly perceived. What Hume calls "sensation" 
is what Whitehead calls "perception in the mode of presentational 
immediacy" which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception 
in the mode of causal efficacy. As long as perception is seen as 
composed only of isolated sense data, most of the quality and interconnectedness 
of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention 
of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical scepticism. Whitehead 
contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity 
of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other 
and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because 
the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and 
tendency to mistake the detail, is initially <given> in the way man 
feels the world. In this respect experience is broader and full of 
a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of 
his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct. 
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is 
one of derivation from the past. Both I and my feelings come up out 
of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are 
ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am. 
After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications 
of melioration, though "in a slight degree", to be sure.

There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century. I leave 
it to the statisticians to say what they were, but I noticed several 
a few years ago, during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg. 
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school 
and the White school, and in every instance the former made a better 
appearance (it was newer, for one thing). It really looked as if a 
change of the sort predicted by Booker T& Washington had been going 
on. But with the renewal of interference in 1954 (as with its beginning 
in 1835), the improvement was impaired.   For over a hundred 
years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them. 
It's infuriating, this feeling that one is being picked on, continually, 
constantly. By what right of superior virtue, Southerners ask, 
do the people of the North do this? The traditional strategy of the 
South has been to expose the vices of the North, to demonstrate that 
the North possessed no superior virtue, to "show the world that" 
(as James's Christopher Newman said to <his> adversaries) "however 
bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it".

In the pre-Civil War years, the South argued that the slave was 
not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North. At 
the present time, the counter-attack takes the line that there's no 
more of the true <spirit> of "integration" in the North than 
in the South. The line is a pretty good one.   People talk about 
"the law of the land". The expression has become quite a cliche. 
But people can't be made to integrate, socialize (the two are inseparable 
by Southern standards) by law.   I was having lunch not 
long ago (apologies to N& V& Peale) with three distinguished 
historians (one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American 
history, and one in the Far East), and I asked them if they 
could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed 
with "deliberate speed, majestic instancy" (Francis Thompson's 
words for the Hound of <Heaven's> pursuit) by judicial fiat. 
They didn't seem to be able to think of any.   A Virginia 
judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years 
might be a reasonable length of time for such a change. But I suspect 
that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation- 
the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he 
said, "They make a desert, and call it peace" ("Solitudinem faciunt, 
pacem appellant".).

Moreover, the law of the land is not 
irrevocable; it can be changed; it has been, many times. Mr& 
Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the 
North, and soon became a dead letter. Prohibition was the law of the 
land, but it was unpopular (how many of us oldsters took up drinking 
in prohibition days, drinking was so gay, so fashionable, especially 
in the sophisticated Northeast!) and was repealed. The cliche loses 
its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.   The 
Declaration of Independence says that "governments derive their 
just powers from the consent of the governed". The phrase "consent 
of the governed" needs a hard look. How do we define it? Is the 
consent of the governed a numerical majority? Calhoun dealt with 
this question in his "Disquisition on Government".   To guard 
against the tyranny of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his 
theory of "concurrent majority", which, he said, "by giving to 
each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the 
action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial 
or local legislation". Who will say that our country is even now a 
homogeneous community? that regional peculiarities do not still exist? 
that the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region? 
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal 
action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of "the consent 
of the governed"?   Circumstances alter cases. A friend 
of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular 
trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell. He 
seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular 
trouble anywhere. I murmured something about a possible difference between 
New Mexico's history and Mississippi's.   One can meet
