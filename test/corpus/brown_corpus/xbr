leader of the tour. Player immediately proved he was not in the 
least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer. He outplayed Palmer 
all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 
71. Thereafter, until the Masters, Player gradually increased 
his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory 
at Miami. When they reached Augusta last week, together they had 
won five of the 13 tournaments to date. 

#INSTANT RIVALRY#

On Thursday, 
the first day of the Masters, the contest between Palmer and 
Player developed instantly. It was a dismal, drizzly day but a good 
one on which to score over the Augusta National course. The usually 
skiddy greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able to strike 
their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward 
the hole without too much worry about the consequences. Palmer's 4-under-par 
68 got him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob Rosburg. 
But Player was only one stroke back, with a 69.   Even 
so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators- 
unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever- that this tournament 
was to be, essentially, a match between Palmer and Player. A lot 
of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus, the spectacular 
young amateur, who had a 70; or Ken Venturi, who had a somewhat shaky 
72 but was bound to do better; or Rosburg, whose accurate short 
game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries; 
or even old Byron Nelson, whose excellent 71 made one 
wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf. (On Thursday 
nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe.)   On 
Friday, a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and 
ugly, the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus. Rosburg 
had started early in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were 
on the course- separated, as they were destined to be for the rest 
of the weekend, 
by about half an hour- they could see on the numerous 
scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a 
73, was not having a good day.   As Player began his second round 
in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery 
was not conspicuously large for a contender. Player began with a birdie 
on the first hole, added five straight pars and then another birdie 
at the 9th. On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of 
a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament. He birdied 
the 13th, the 15th and the 18th- five birdies, one bogey and 12 pars 
for a 68.   Starting half an hour behind Player in company with 
British Open Champion Kel Nagle, Palmer birdied the 2nd, the 
9th, the 13th and the 16th- four birdies, one bogey and 13 pars for 
a 69. The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would 
roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be answered 
moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph. 
At one point late in the day, when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot 
putt on the 16th, a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th 
green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole. 
Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed 
(although he later admitted that he had) Palmer proceeded to sink 
his 25-footer, and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling 
back along the intervening fairways in reply. 

#THE BOLDNESS OF CHAMPIONS# 

Anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way 
had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing 
this most difficult golf course. It is almost axiomatic that golfers 
who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots 
with a vehemence bordering on violence. The bad luck that can so often 
mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated 
by the contemptuous boldness of these champions. Bob Jones played 
that way. Byron Nelson did, Hogan did. And last week at the Masters 
Palmer and Player did.   As the third round of the tournament 
began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's 
superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead. This 
day Palmer had started first. As Player stepped on the first tee 
he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 
2 under par for the day. Player immediately proceeded to follow suit. 
In fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well, to go 4 under 
par for the first eight holes.   But Player's real test came 
on the ninth hole, a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards. 
He hit a poor tee shot, pulling it off into the pine woods separating 
the 9th and first fairways. Having hit one of the trees, the ball came 
to rest not more than 160 yards out. Player then had the choice of 
punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling 
for a bogey 5, or gambling. The latter involved hitting a full 
four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse, hoping to 
slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.   "I was hitting 
the ball well", Player said later, "and I felt strong. When 
you're playing like that you'd better attack".   Player attacked 
with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever 
forget. It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the 
edge. From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.

Palmer, meanwhile, had been having his troubles. They started on 
the 4th hole, a 220-yard par-3. On this day the wind had switched 180` 
from the northwest to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the 
course was different from the previous few days. At the 4th tee Palmer 
chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club, so 
he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green. His bogey 4 on this 
hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought 
him back to even par.   Starting the second nine, Palmer was 
already four strokes behind Player and knew it.

When Mickey Charles Mantle, the New York Yankees' man 
of muscle, drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers, his feat touches 
upon the sublime. When Roger Eugene Maris, Mantle's muscular 
teammate, powers four home runs in a double-header, his performance 
merits awe. But when tiny, 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the 
Los Angeles Angels, who once caught three straight fly balls in center 
field because, as a teammate explained, "the other team thought 
no one was out there", hits seven home runs in four months (three 
more than his total in 1958, 1959, and 1960), his achievement borders 
on the ridiculous. This is Baseball 1961. This is the year home runs 
ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.   It is the year when 
(1) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the 
plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented 
style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs; (2) Willie Mays 
of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became 
the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game; (3) the 
Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs 
in three games and lost two of them; and (4) catcher Johnny Blanchard 
of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four 
successive times at bat, two of them as a pinch-hitter.   Pitchers 
grumble about lively balls and lively bats, the shrinking strike 
zone, and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal. Experts 
point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused 
by expansion. Whatever the reasons, not in 30 years has a single season 
produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records, 
home-run division.   Of all the records in peril, one stands 
apart, dramatic in its making, dramatic in its endurance, and now, 
doubly dramatic in its jeopardy. This, of course, is baseball's most 
remarkable mark: The 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible 
epicure, the incredible athlete, George Herman (Babe) Ruth of the 
Yankees.   Since 1927, fewer than a dozen men have made serious 
runs at Babe Ruth's record and each, in turn, has been thwarted. 
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September 
surge. In the final month of the 1927 season, he hit seventeen 
home runs, a closing spurt never matched. 

#DOUBLE THREAT:# 

Always, 
in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record, one man alone- a 
Jimmy Foxx (58 in 1932) or a Hank Greenberg (58 in 1938) or a Hack 
Wilson (56 in 1930)- made the bid. But now, for the first time 
since Lou Gehrig (with 47 home runs) spurred Ruth on in 1927, two men 
playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60. Their names are Mantle 
and Maris, their team is the Yankees, and their threat is real.

After 108 games in 1927, Ruth had 35 home runs. After 108 
games in 1961, Mickey Mantle has 43, Roger Maris 41. Extend Mantle's 
and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 
games, and, mathematically, each will hit more than 60 home runs. This 
is the 
great edge the two Yankees have going for them. To better Ruth's 
mark, neither needs a spectacular September flourish. All Mantle 
needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September, 
and he will establish a new record. In Ruth's day- and until this 
year- the schedule was 154 games. Baseball commissioner Ford Frick 
has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is 
broken in 154 games.)   "Even on the basis of 154 games, this 
is the ideal situation", insists Hank Greenberg, now vice-president 
of the Chicago White Sox. "It has to be easier with two of them. 
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle"? 

#ROOMMATES:# 

Neither Mantle nor Maris, understandably, will predict 60 home runs 
for himself. Although both concede they would like to hit 60, they 
stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote: "The 
important thing is to win the pennant". But one thing is for certain: 
There is no dissension between Mantle, the American League's 
Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957, and Maris, the ~MVP 
in 1960. Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ("I hope Roger 
hits 80", Mantle says), and each enjoys even more seeing himself 
hit home runs ("and I hope I hit 81").   The sluggers get 
along so well in fact, that with their families at home for the summer 
(Mantle's in Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City), they are rooming 
together. Mantle, Maris, and Bob Cerv, a utility outfielder, share 
an apartment in Jamaica, Long Island, not far from New York 
International Airport. The three pay $251 a month for four rooms (kitchen, 
dining room, living room, and bedroom), with air-conditioning 
and new modern furniture. Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom; 
Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room. They 
divide up the household chores: Cerv does most of the cooking (breakfast 
and sandwich snacks, with dinner out), Mantle supplies the 
transportation (a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible), and Maris drives 
the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium. 
Mantle, Maris, and Cerv probably share one major-league record already: 
Among them, they have fifteen children- eight for Cerv, four 
for Mantle, and three for Maris.   As roommates, teammates, 
and home-run mates, Mantle, 29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years 
ago, and Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City 
two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds. Both were scholastic 
stars in football, basketball, and baseball (Mantle in Commerce, 
Okla&, Maris in Fargo, N&D&); as halfbacks, both came close 
to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ("Sometimes 
in the minors", Maris recalls, "I wished I had gone to Oklahoma").

To an extent, the two even look alike. Both have blue 
eyes and short blond hair. Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 
and 200 pounds, but Mantle, incredibly muscular (he has a 17-1/2-inch 
neck), looks bigger. With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders, 
both must have their clothes made to order. Maris purchases $100
