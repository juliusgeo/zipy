develops some very significant observations about problems of a sort 
that are often difficult. A few of his examples are of very great interest, 
and the whole discussion of some importance for theory. His orthographic 
recommendations are no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on 
the one hand or of superficiality on the other. Rather he weighs each 
phonologic fact in the light of its orthographic usefulness. He concludes 
that some changes can made in the current orthography which will 
appreciably improve its usefulness, but hesitates to suggest precise 
graphic devices to effect these changes. I hope his suggestions are 
given the consideration they deserve in Kikuyu circles. This, however, 
will not exhaust their practical usefulness, as they rather clearly 
indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography 
design. We need many more studies of this sort if the design 
of written languages is to be put on a sound basis.   One other 
paper deals with a phonologic problem: Vowel Harmony in Igbo, by 
J& Carnochan. This restates the already widely known facts in terms 
of prosodies. As a restatement it makes only a small contribution 
to knowledge of Igbo. But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating 
the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems 
of Igbo phonology. The paper has a certain value as a comparatively 
easy introduction to this approach, particularly since it treats 
a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it is possible 
to compare it with a more traditional (though not structural) statement. 
It does show one feature of the system that has not been previously 
described. But it does not, as it claims, demonstrate that this could 
not be treated by traditional methods. It seems to me that it rather 
easily can.   Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems. 
On the whole they maintain much the same high standard, but they 
are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider 
variety of subject matter. My comments must be briefer than the papers 
deserve.   W& H& Whiteley writes on The Verbal Radical 
in Iraqw. This must be considered primarily an amendment and supplement 
to his early A short Description of Item-Categories in Iraqw. 
It exhibits much the same descriptive technique and is open to much 
the same criticisms. The treatment seems unnecessarily loose-jointed 
and complex, largely because the method is lax and the analysis seems 
never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point. 
There are more stems per item in Athabascan, which expresses the fact 
that the Athabascan languages have undergone somewhat more change in 
diverging from proto-Athabascan than the Yokuts languages from proto-Yokuts. 
This may be because the Athabascan divergence began earlier; 
or again because the Athabascan languages spread over a very much 
larger territory (including three wholly separated areas); or both. 
The differentiation however is not very much greater, as shown by 
the fact that Athabascan shows 3.46 stems per meaning slot as against 
2.75 for Yokuts, with a slightly greater number of languages represented 
in our sample: 24 as against 21. (On deduction of one-eighth from 
3.46, the stem/item rate becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number 
of languages.) These general facts are mentioned to make clear 
that the total situation in the two families is similar enough to warrant 
comparison.   The greatest difference in the two sets of figures 
is due to differences in the two sets of lists used. These differences 
in turn result from the fact that my Yokuts vocabularies were 
built up of terms selected mainly to insure unambiguity of English meaning 
between illiterate informants and myself, within a compact and uniform 
territorial area, but that Hoijer's vocabulary is based on Swadesh's 
second glottochronological list which aims at eliminating 
all items which might be culturally or geographically determined. Swadesh 
in short was trying to develop a basic list that was universal; 
I, one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley. The 
result is that I included 70 animal names, but Swadesh only 4; 
and somewhat similarly for plants, 16 as against 4. Swadesh, and therefore 
Hoijer, felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even 
genera (<fox, vulture, salmon, yellow pine, manzanita>); their 
classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or 
recurrent parts (<fish, bird, tree, grass, horn, tail, bark, root>). 
The groups are therefore really non-comparable in content as well as 
in size.   Other classes are included only by myself (interrogatives, 
adverbs) or only by Swadesh and Hoijer (pronouns, demonstratives).

What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes: 
(1) body parts and products, which with a proportionally nearly 
even representation (51 terms out of 253, 25 out of 100) come out with 
nearly even ratios; 2.6 and 2.7; (2) Nature (29 terms against 
17), ratios 3.3 versus 4.1; (3) adjectives (16, 15 terms), ratios 3.9 
versus 4.7; (4) verbs (9, 22 terms), ratios 4.0 versus 3.4. 
It will be seen that where the scope is similar, the Athabascan ratios 
come out somewhat higher (as indeed they ought to with a total ratio 
of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4:5) except for verbs, where alone the Athabascan 
ratio is lower. This exception may be connected with Hoijer's 
use of a much higher percentage of verbs: 22% of his total 
list as against 3.5% in mine. Or the exception may be due to a particular 
durability peculiar to the Athabascan verb. More word class ratios 
determined in more languages will no doubt ultimately answer the 
question.

If word classes differ in their resistance or liability 
to stem replacement within meaning slot, it is conceivable that 
individual meanings also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually. 
Hoijer's Athabascan and my Yokuts share 71 identical meanings (with 
allowance for several near-synonyms like <stomach-belly, big-large, 
long-far, many-much, die-dead, say-speak>). For Yokuts, 
I tabulated these 71 items in five columns, according as they were expressed 
by 1, 2, 3, 4, and more than 4 stems. The totals for these 
five categories are not too uneven, namely 20, 15, 11, 16, 9 respectively. 
For Athabascan, with a greater range of stems, the first two 
of five corresponding columns were identical, 1 and 2 stems; the three 
others had to be spread somewhat, and are headed respectively **f; 
**f; and **f stems. While the particular limits of these groupings 
may 
seem artificially arbitrary; they do fairly express a corresponding 
grouping of more variable material, and they eventuate also in five 
classes, along a similar scale, containing approximately equal numbers 
of cases, namely 19, 14, 15, 11, 12 in Athabascan.   When now 
we count the frequency of the 71 items in the two language families appearing 
in the same column or grade, or one column or grade apart, or 
two or three or four, we find these differences: **f   This distribution 
can be summarized by averaging the distance in grades apart: 
**f; which, divided by **f gives a mean of 1.07 grades apart. If 
the distribution of the 71 items were wholly concordant in the two families, 
the distance would of course be 0. If it were wholly random 
and unrelated, it would be 2.0, assuming the five classes were equal in 
~<n>, which approximately they are. The actual mean of 1.07 being 
about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 2.0 of no correlation, 
it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree of similarity 
in the behavior even of particular INDIVIDUAL items of meaning 
as regards long-term stem displacement.

In 1960, David D& 
Thomas published Basic Vocabulary in some Mon-Khmer Languages 
~AL 2, no& 3, pp& 7-11), which compares 8 Mon-Khmer languages 
with the ~I-E language data on which Swadesh based the revised 
retention 
rate (**f) in place of original (**f), and his revised 100 word 
basic 
glottochronological list in Towards Greater Accuracy **h (~IJAL 
21:121-137). Thomas' findings are, first, "that the individual 
items vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence"; 
but, second, "that the semantic groups are surprisingly unvarying 
in their average persistence" (as between ~M-K and ~I-E. His 
first conclusion, on behavior of individual items, is negative, whereas 
mine (on Ath& and Yok&) was partially positive. His second 
conclusion, 
on semantic word classes, agrees with mine. This second conclusion, 
independently arrived at by independent study of material from two 
pairs of language families as different and remote from one another 
as these four are, cannot be ignored.   Thomas also presents a 
simple equation for deriving an index of persistence, which weights not 
only the number of stems ('roots') per meaning, but their relative 
frequency. Thus his persistence values for some stem frequencies per 
meaning is: stem identical in 8 languages, 100%; stem frequencies 
7 and 1, 86%; stem frequencies 4 and 4, 64%; stem frequencies 
4, 3, and 1, 57%. His formula will have to be weighed, may be 
altered or improved, and it should be tested on additional bodies of 
material. But consideration of the frequency of stems per constant meaning 
seems to be established as having significance in comparative situations 
with diachronic and classificatory relevance; and Gleason 
presumably is on the way with a further contribution in this area.

As to relative frequencies of competing roots (7-1 vs& 4-4, etc&), 
Thomas with his 'weighting' seems to be the first to have considered 
the significance this might have. The problem needs further 
exploration. I was at least conscious of the distinction in my full 
Yokuts presentation that awaits publication, in which, in listing 'Two-Stem 
Meanings', I set off by asterisks those forms in which 
~<n> of stem ~B was **f of stem ~A/3, the unasterisked ones 
standing for **f; or under 'Four Stems', I set off by asterisks 
cases where the combined ~<n> of stems **f was **f.

These 
findings, and others which will in time be developed, will affect 
the method of glottochronological inquiry. If adjectival meanings show 
relatively low retentiveness of stems, as I am confident will prove 
to be the case in most languages of the world, why should our basic 
lists include 15 per cent of these unstable forms, but only 8 per cent 
of animals and plants which replace much more slowly? Had Hoijer 
substituted for his 15 adjectival slots 15 good animal and plant items, 
his rate of stem replacement would have been lower and the age of Athabascan 
language separation smaller. And irrespective of the outcome 
in centuries elapsed since splitting, calculations obviously carry more 
concordant and comparable meaning if they deal with the most stable 
units 
than with variously unstable ones.   It is evident that Swadesh 
has not only had much experience with basic vocabulary in many languages 
but has acquired great tact and feeling for the expectable behavior 
of lexical items. Why then this urge to include unstable items 
in his basic list? It is the urge to obtain a list as free of geographical 
and cultural conditioning as possible. And why that insistence? 
It is the hope of attaining a list of items of UNIVERSAL occurrence. 
But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope is 
a snare. Not that such a list cannot be constructed; but the nearer 
it comes to attaining universality, the less significant will it be 
linguistically. Its terms will tend to be labile or vague, and they 
will fit actual languages more and more badly.   The practical operational 
problem of lexicostatistics is the establishment of a basic 
list of items of meaning against which the particular forms or terms 
of languages can be matched as the medium of comparison. The most important 
quality of the meanings is that they should be as definable as 
possible. In proportion as meanings are concrete, we can better rely 
on their being insulated and distinctive. An elephant or a fox or a swan 
or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality 
of obvious, common-sense, indubitable IDENTITY, as do an eye 
or tooth or nail. They isolate out easily, naturally, and unambiguously 
from the continuum of nature and existence; and they should be
