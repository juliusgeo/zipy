norm governing subgroups and roles. The scope of this study does 
not provide for the study of roles of various types within the larger 
system or within the subgroups. However, it cannot be presumed, informal 
though the structure of the population seems, that there are not 
well-defined roles within the system.   The present study relates 
to the theory of functional systems. It is hypothesized that fertility 
is a function of the social system when the population as a whole 
is considered and a function of the subsystems when the two-fold division 
of core families and marginal families is considered. The four 
functional problems of a social system are, to some extent, solved by 
the subsystems within this population. By means of geographical isolation 
and high fertility rates, inbreeding can be fostered and the pattern 
of isolation from the greater society maintained. In order to attain 
the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension, the high fertility 
rate provides more group members for mate selection, and the clustering 
of members in groups fosters acceptance of group controls. To 
maintain their intermediate position in the larger society, it is not 
only necessary that members of this population be "visible", but 
that their numbers be great enough to be recognized as a separate, distinct 
grouping or system in society. As mentioned above, where families 
are concentrated in larger numbers, group controls seem strongest and 
most effective. Adaptation to the social and non-social environment 
through the economy has been met to a degree through a type of occupational 
segregation. This provides the necessary contact with the larger 
society, while supporting a type of control over members in terms 
of social contacts.   Integration "has to do with the inter-relation 
of parts". The problem of solidarity and morale again involves 
the concept of values. The values placed by the Brandywine population, 
upon maintaining a certain homogeneity, a certain separate racial 
identity, and therefore a certain separate social status, are important 
for the morale of the system. Since morale is closely related to 
pattern maintenance and integration, the higher the morale and solidarity, 
the better the system can solve the problems of the system. In this 
respect it would seem that the greater the social distance between 
the Brandywine population and the white and Negro populations within 
the same general locality, the greater the possibility for higher morale 
and solidarity within the Brandywine population. It is conceived 
that one of the means to attain this social distance is that of physical 
and social isolation. In turn, higher fertility rates for this population 
provide a means of increasing the numerical quantity of the 
population, allowing for the possibility of greater stability and unity. 
The population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow larger. 

#MASTER PROCESSES#

Of particular utility in the analysis of the 
development, persistence, and change of social systems has been the 
use of the master or comprehensive processes. Loomis considers six such 
processes in his paradigm.   1. Communication   2. Boundary 
maintenance   3. Systemic linkage   4. Socialization

5. Social control   6. Institutionalization Though undoubtedly 
all six processes are operative within the whole social system 
and its subsystems, two processes that are of crucial importance to 
this study will be singled out for particular emphasis: _COMMUNICATION:_ 
In discussing the process of communication, Loomis defines 
it as "the process by which information, decisions, and directives 
are transmitted among actors and the ways in which knowledge, opinions, 
and attitudes are formed, or modified by interaction". Communication 
may be facilitated by means of the high visibility within the larger 
community. Intense interaction is easier where segregated living and 
occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community, 
as in the case of this population. However, the factor of physical 
isolation is not a static situation. Although the Brandywine population 
is still predominantly rural, "there are indications of a consistent 
and a statistically significant trend away from the older and 
relatively isolated rural communities **h urbanization appears to be 
an important factor in the disintegration of this group. This conclusion 
is, however, an over-simplification. A more realistic analysis must 
take into account the fact that Brandywine people in the urban-fringe 
area are, in general, less segregated locally than group members 
in rural areas. In the urban area, in other words, they, unlike some 
urban ethnic groups, do not concentrate in ghetto colonies. Group pressures 
toward conformity are slight or non-existent, and deviant behavior 
in mate selection incurs few if any social sanctions. In such a setting 
social contacts and associations are likely to be heterogamous, 
resulting in a change of values and almost necessarily, in mate selection 
behavior. To the extent that urban life contributes to the breakdown 
of the group patterns of residential isolation, to that extent it 
contributes directly to increased exogamy". _SOCIAL CONTROL:_ 
The process of social control is operative insofar as sanctions play 
a part in the individual's behavior, as well as the group's behavior. 
By means of this social control, deviance is either eliminated 
or somehow made compatible with the function of the social group. Examples 
from this population indicate that deviance seems to be sanctioned 
by ostracism from the group. _SOCIALIZATION:_ There is an oral 
tradition among the members of the population in regard to the origin 
and subsequent separate status of the group in the larger society. 
Confused and divided though this tradition may be, it is an important 
part of the social and cultural heritage of the group, and acts as a 
means of socialization, particularly for members of the rural community. 
The fact of Indian ancestry and "free" status during the days 
of slavery, are important distinctions made by members of the group. 
_BOUNDARY MAINTENANCE:_ "Culturally induced social cohesion resulting 
from common norms and values internalized by members of the group" 
is operative in the boundary maintenance of the group as well 
as in the process of socialization. The process of boundary maintenance 
identifies and preserves the social system or subsystems, and the characteristic 
interaction is maintained. As the threat of encroachment 
on the system increases, the "probability of applied boundary maintenance 
mechanisms increases".   The fertility rate pattern would 
seem to be a function, though a latent one, of the process of maintaining 
the boundary. "Increased boundary maintenance may be achieved, 
for example, by assigning a higher primacy or evaluation to activities 
characteristic of the external pattern **h" The external pattern 
or external system can be considered as "group behavior that enables 
the group to survive in its environment **h" Boundary maintenance 
for 
this group would seem to be primarily social, as is the preference 
for endogamy. It is also expressed in the proscription against deviants 
in the matter of endogamy, particularly in rural areas. By their 
pattern of endogamy and exogamy, the core families and the marginal families 
show distinct limits to the intergroup contact they maintain. 
_SYSTEMIC LINKAGE:_ Where boundary maintenance describes the boundaries 
or limits of the group, systemic linkage is defined "as the 
process whereby one or more of the elements of at least two social systems 
is articulated in such a manner that the two systems in some ways 
and on some occasions may be viewed as a single unit.

A royal decree issued in 1910, two years after the Belgian government 
assumed authority for the administration of the Congo, prescribed 
the registration of all adult males by chiefdoms. Further decrees 
along this line were issued in 1916 and 1919. In 1922 a continuous 
registration of the whole indigenous population was instituted by ordinance 
of the Governor-General, and the periodic compilation of these 
records was ordered. But specific procedures for carrying out this 
plan were left to the discretion of the provincial governors. A unified 
set of regulations, applicable to all areas, was issued in 1929, and 
a complementary series of demographic inquiries in selected areas was 
instituted at the same time. The whole system was again reviewed and 
reorganized in 1933. General responsibility for its administration rested 
with a division of the colonial government concerned with labor 
supply and native affairs, Service des Affaires Indigenes et de la 
Main-d'Oeuvre (~AIMO, **f Direction, **f Direction Generale, 
Gouvernement Generale). Tribal authorities, the chiefs and their 
secretaries, were held responsible for maintaining the registers of 
indigenous persons within their territories, under the general supervision 
of district officials. The district officials, along with their 
other duties, were obliged to organize special demographic inquiries in 
selected areas and to supervise the annual tabulations of demographic 
statistics.   The regulations require the inscription of each 
individual (male or female, adult or child) on a separate card (<fiche>). 
The cards, filed by <circonscription> (sub-chiefdom, or village), 
are kept in the headquarters of each <territoire> (chiefdom). Each 
card is expected to show certain information about the individual 
concerned, including his or her date of birth (or age at a specified 
time), spouses, and children. Additional entries must be made from time 
to time. Different cards are used for males and females, and a corner 
is clipped from the cards of adults, and of children when they reach 
puberty. So a quick count could be made at any time, even by an illiterate 
clerk, of the number of registered persons in four age-and-sex 
classes. Personal identification cards are issued to all adult males 
on which tax payments, inoculations, periods of employment, and changes 
of residence are recorded. Similar identification cards were issued 
in 1959 to all adult females. Each adult is held personally responsible 
for assuring his inscription and obtaining an identification card 
which must be shown on demand. The registration card of a person leaving 
his home territory for a short period is put into a special file 
for absent persons. The cards of permanent out-migrants are, in theory, 
sent to an office in the place of new residence. Finally, the registration 
of births and deaths by nearest relatives was made compulsory 
in most regions.   Numbers of registered persons in four age-and-sex 
classes were counted each year. In addition, demographic inquiries, 
supposedly involving field investigations, were conducted in selected 
minor divisions (<circonscriptions>) containing about 3 percent 
of the total population. The results of these inquiries were used to 
adjust compilations of data from the registers and to provide various 
ratios and rates by districts, including birth and death rates, general 
fertility rates, distributions by marital status, fertility of wives 
separately in polygynous and non-polygynous households, infant mortality, 
and migration. The areas to be examined in these inquiries were 
selected by local officials, supposedly as representative of a larger 
population. Averages of the ratios obtained in a few selected areas 
were applied to the larger population.   The scheme, in theory, 
is an ingenious adaptation of European registration systems to the conditions 
of African life. But it places a severe strain on the administrative 
resources (already burdened in other ways) of a widely dispersed, 
poor and largely illiterate population. The sampling program was 
instituted before the principles of probability sampling were widely 
recognized in population studies. The system was not well adapted to 
conditions of life in urban centers. The distinction between domiciled 
(<de jure>) and present (<de facto>) population was not clearly 
defined. So the results are subject to considerable confusion. The 
system tended to break down during the war, but was reactivated; it 
had reached the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951. In spite of the 
defects in this system, the figures on total population during the late 
1930's and again in the early 1950's seem to have represented actual 
conditions in most districts with approximate fidelity. But the 
information on the dynamics of population was often quite misleading.

The same system, with minor modifications, was developed in Ruanda-Urundi 
under Belgian administration. Here again it seems that 
useful approximations of the size and geographical distribution of the 
population were obtained in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war 
periods.   Before considering more recent activities, we 
should note another important aspect of demography in Belgian Africa. 
A number of strong independent agencies, established in some cases 
with governmental or royal support, have conducted large medical, social, 
educational and research operations in particular parts of the Congo 
and Ruanda-Urundi. The work of Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance
