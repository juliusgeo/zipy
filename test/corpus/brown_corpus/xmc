very little in others. In the latter cases an additional treatment of 
the ~DEAE-cellulose-treated **f with 50 ~mg of sweet clover stem 
tissue powder further improved the specificity. After these treatments 
the conjugate did not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissues 
or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable 
from the bright yellow-green specific staining. With this purified 
conjugate the best staining procedure consisted of treating the sections 
with 1:10 dilution of **f for 30 minutes, washing with ~PBS 
for 15 minutes, staining with **f for 30 minutes, and washing with 
~PBS for 15 minutes. The specificity of staining in ~WTV tumors 
with **f and **f but not with ~NS and **f or with antiserum to 
potato yellow-dwarf virus and **f, and the absence of such staining 
in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover, indicate that an antigen 
of ~WTV was being stained. _DIRECT METHOD._ **f was first conjugated 
with 50 ~mg of ~FITC per gram of globulin. This conjugate 
was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various 
tissue powders in the same manner as described for the indirect method. 
In all cases a disturbing amount of nonspecific staining was still 
present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence.

In later experiments, **f and **f were prepared by conjugating 
8 ~mg of ~FITC per gram of globulin. These conjugates 
**f had much less nonspecific staining than the previous conjugate (with 
50 ~mg ~FITC per gram of globulin) while the specific staining 
was similar in both cases. Nonspecific staining could be satisfactorily 
eliminated by passing these conjugates through a ~DEAE-cellulose 
column as described for **f. The best staining procedure with 
this purified **f consisted of staining with the conjugate for 30 
minutes and washing in ~PBS for 15 minutes. The specificity of 
staining with **f was established as follows: **f specifically stained 
tumor sections but not sections of healthy sweet clover stems or 
of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover. Sections of tumors incited 
by ~WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum 
or conjugated antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus.   After 
passing **f through ~DEAE-cellulose, the titer of antibodies to 
~WTV in the specific fraction was 1:4 of the titer before such 
passage (precipitin ring tests by R& F& Whitcomb); but mere dilution 
of the conjugate to 1:4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific 
staining. This indicates that increase in specificity of **f after 
passing it through ~DEAE-cellulose was not merely due to dilution.

Specific staining by ~DEAE-cellulose treated **f 
and **f, although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either 
nonspecific staining or autofluorescence of cells, was not satisfactorily 
photographed to show such differences in spite of many attempts 
with black and white and color photography. This was chiefly because 
of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cells. The autofluorescence 
from the walls of the xylem cells was particularly brilliant. 
_DISTRIBUTION OF VIRUS ANTIGEN_ Results of specific staining by the 
direct and the indirect methods were similar and showed the localization 
of ~WTV antigen in certain tissues of tumors. The virus antigen 
was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue. Frequently a few isolated 
thick-walled cells or, rarely, groups of such cells in the xylem region, 
were also specifically stained, but there was no such staining 
in epidermis, cortex, most xylem cells, ray cells, or pith.   Within 
the pseudophloem cells the distribution of ~WTV antigen was 
irregular in the cytoplasm. No antigen was detectable in certain dark 
spherical areas in most cells. These areas are thought to represent 
the 
nuclei. In some tumor sections small spherical bodies, possibly inclusion 
bodies (Littau and Black, 1952) stained more intensely than 
the rest of cytoplasm and probably contained more antigen. In all cases 
studied tissues of the stem on which the tumor had developed did not 
contain detectable amounts of ~WTV antigen. 

#DISCUSSION#

In 
both the direct and indirect methods of staining, the conjugates had 
nonspecifically staining fractions. In the indirect method, this was 
evident from the fact that tumor sections were stained light green 
even when stained with ~NS and **f or with **f only. In the direct 
method, **f, not further treated, stained certain tissues of healthy 
sweet clover stems nonspecifically and ~WTV tumor sections were similarly 
stained by comparable **f. After **f and **f were passed through 
Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover 
tissue powder, nonspecific staining was greatly reduced but a disturbing 
amount of such staining was still present. Treatment of the conjugates 
with ethyl acetate, and the conjugates (which had been passed 
through Dowex-2-chloride) with mouse liver powder, sweet clover crown 
gall tissue powder, or healthy sweet clover proteins did not satisfactorily 
remove nonspecifically staining substances in the conjugates. Such 
treatments of the conjugates have usually been successful in eliminating 
nonspecific staining in several other systems (Coons, 1958). Schramm 
and Ro^ttger (1959) did not report any such nonspecific staining 
of plant tissues with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco 
mosaic virus. The reason for the failure of these treatments to 
eliminate nonspecific staining in the conjugates in our system is not 
known.   In our work the best procedure for removing substances 
causing nonspecific staining in order to obtain specific conjugates was 
to pass the conjugates through a ~DEAE-cellulose 
column and in some cases to absorb the first and second 
milliliter fractions with sweet clover tissue powder.   The 
specific 
staining by both direct and indirect methods showed that ~WTV antigen 
was concentrated in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled 
cells in the xylem region, but was not detectable in any other 
tissues of the root and stem tumors. A study of the distribution of ~WTV 
antigen within the pseudophloem cells indicates that it is irregularly 
distributed in the cytoplasm.   Wound-tumor virus is a leafhopper 
transmitted virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation 
(Black, 1944; Brakke <et al>&, 1954). The concentration 
and 
apparent localization of the ~WTV antigen in pseudophloem tissue 
of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiplies 
in the phloem and may need to be directly placed in this tissue in order 
to infect plants.

Since emotional reactions in the higher vertebrates depend on 
individual experience and are aroused in man, in addition, by complex 
symbols, one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excited from 
the cortex. In experiments with topical application of strychnine on 
the cerebral cortex, the transmission of impulses from the cortex to the 
hypothalamus was demonstrated. Moreover, the responsiveness of the 
hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation is greatly increased under these 
conditions. Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms 
of emotional arousal could be elicited in monkey ~<A> on seeing 
monkey ~<B> (but not a rabbit) in emotional stress. A previously 
extinguished conditioned reaction was restored in monkey ~<A> 
and was associated 
with typical signs of emotional excitement including sympathetic 
discharges.   It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism 
exists between the paleo- and the neocortex as far as emotional reactivity 
is concerned, and that the balance between the two systems determines 
the emotional responsiveness of the organism. In addition, the 
neocortical-hypothalamic relations play a great role in primates, as 
Mirsky's interesting experiment on the "communication of affect" 
demonstrates. But even in relatively primitive laboratory animals 
such as the rat, sex activity closely identified with the hypothalamus 
and the visceral brain is enhanced by the neocortex. MacLean stressed 
correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of 
the individual and the species, as evidenced by the influence of the 
limbic brain (including the hypothalamus) on emotions related to fight 
and flight and also on sexual functions. It should be added that in 
man 
neocortical-hypothalamic interrelations probably play a role in the fusion 
of emotional processes with those underlying perception, memory, 
imagination, and creativity.   Previous experiences are obviously 
of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional 
response. The visceral brain as well as the neocortex is known to contribute 
to memory, but this topic is beyond the scope of this 
paper. #/13,. HYPOTHALAMIC BALANCE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE#

After 
this brief discussion of neo-, paleocortical, and cortico-hypothalamic 
relations, let us return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance 
and its physiological and pathological significance. Facilitatory 
processes take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascending 
and descending pathways. Thus cortico-fugal discharges induced by topical 
application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate 
with spikes present in the hypothalamus and cause increased convulsive 
discharges. On the other hand, the temporary reduction in hypothalamic 
excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior 
hypothalamus causes a lessening in frequency and amplitude of 
cortical strychnine spikes until the hypothalamic excitability is restored. 
Apparently, a positive feedback exists between the posterior hypothalamus 
and the cerebral cortex. Consequently, if for any reason 
the hypothalamic excitability falls below the physiological level, the 
lessened hypothalamic-cortical discharges lead to a diminished state 
of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal 
discharges. Obviously, a vicious cycle develops. This tendency can 
be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability directly or 
via cortico-hypothalamic pathways. It is believed that drug therapy 
and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism.

Before we comment further on these pathological conditions, 
we should remember that changes in the state of the hypothalamus within 
physiological limits distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Thus, 
a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharges prevails in sleep 
and a high one during wakefulness, resulting in synchronous ~EEG 
potentials in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition. Moreover, 
the dominance in parasympathetic action (with reciprocal inhibition 
of the sympathetic) at the hypothalamic level induces, by its peripheral 
action, the autonomic symptoms of sleep and, by its action on the 
cortex, a lessening in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus 
of the somatic nervous system. With the dominance of the sympathetic 
division of the hypothalamus, the opposite changes occur. Since 
electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produces the effects 
of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induces 
sleep, it may be said that the reactivity of the whole organism is 
altered by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus. 
Similar effects can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor reflexes 
in man and animals.   Of particular importance is the study of 
the actions of drugs in this respect. Although no drugs act exclusively 
on the hypothalamus or a part of it, there is sufficient specificity 
to distinguish drugs which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic 
side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance. The 
former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs, the latter the tranquilizers. 
Specific differences exist in the action of different drugs 
belonging to the same group as, for instance, between reserpine and 
chlorpromazine. Important as these differences are, they should not 
obscure the basic fact that by shifting the hypothalamic balance sufficiently 
to the parasympathetic side, we produce depressions, whereas 
a shift in the opposite direction causes excitatory effects and, eventually, 
maniclike changes. The emotional states produced by drugs influence 
the cortical potentials in a characteristic manner; synchrony 
prevails in the ~EEG of the experimental animal after administration 
of tranquilizers, but asynchrony after application of analeptic and 
psychoactive drugs.   The shock therapies act likewise on the 
hypothalamic balance. Physiological experiments and clinical observations
