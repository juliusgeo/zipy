wife and Casanova below, Lewis said, "Earl, there is Gracie's 
future husband". And when questioned by ship's reporters about 
the separation, she said, "I adore him, and he adores me". 
Blackman had brought news from Kansas City. Before his departure, 
a group of his friends, the Reverend Stidger among them, had given 
him a luncheon, and Stidger had seen advance sheets of <Elmer Gantry>. 
He was outraged by the book and announced that he had discovered 
fifty technical errors in its account of church practices. L& M& 
Birkhead challenged him to name one and he was silent. But his rancor 
did not cease, and presently, on March 13, when he preached a sermon 
on the text, "And Ben-hadad Was Drunk", he told his congregation 
how disappointed he was in Mr& Lewis, how he regretted having 
had him in his house, and how he should have been warned by the fact 
that the novelist was drunk all the time that he was working on the 
book. But that sermon, like those of hundreds of other ministers, was 
yet to be delivered.   In London Lewis took the usual suite 
in Bury Street. To the newspapers he talked about his unquiet life, 
about his wish to be a newspaperman once more, about the prevalence of 
American slang in British speech, about the loquacity of the English 
and the impossibility of finding quiet in a railway carriage, about 
his plans to wander for two years "unless stopped and made to write 
another book". The <Manchester Guardian> wondered how anyone 
in a railway carriage would have an opportunity to talk to Mr& Lewis, 
since it was well known that Mr& Lewis always did all of the talking. 
His English friends, it said, had gone into training to keep 
up with him vocally and with his "allegro movements around the luncheon 
table". The New York <Times> editorialist wondered just who 
would stop Mr& Lewis and make him write a book.   Lewis's 
remarks about his marriage were suggestive enough to induce American 
reporters to invade the offices of Harcourt, Brace + Company for 
information, to pursue Mrs& Lewis to Cromwell Hall, and, after 
she had returned to New York, to ferret her out at the Stanhope on 
upper Fifth Avenue where she had taken an apartment. There, to the 
<Evening Post,> she emphatically denied the divorce rumors and explained 
that she had stayed behind because of the schooling of their son, 
which henceforth would be strictly American. These rumors of permanent 
separation started up a whole crop of stories about her. One had 
it that a friend, protesting her snobbery, said, "But, Gracie, 
you are an American, aren't you"? and she replied, "I was born 
in America, <but> I was <conceived> in <Vienna">. Lewis 
himself furthered these tales. He is said to have reported that once, 
when she went to a hospital to call on a friend after a serious operation, 
and the friend protested that it had been "nothing", she replied, 
"Well, it was your healthy American peasant blood that pulled 
you through". With these and similar tales he was entertaining his 
English friends, all of whom he was seeing when he was not showing 
Blackman the sights of London and its environs.   At once upon 
his arrival, he telephoned Lady Sybil Colefax who invited them to 
tea, and then Lewis decided to give a party as a quick way of rounding 
up his friends. He invited Lady Sybil, Lord Thomson, Bechhofer 
Roberts, and a half dozen others. It was a dinner party, Lewis had 
been drinking during the afternoon, and long before the party really 
got under way, he was quite drunk, with the result that the party broke 
up even before dinner was over. Lewis, at the head of the table, would 
leap up and move around behind the chairs of his guests making remarks 
that, when not highly offensive, were at least highly inappropriate, 
and then presently he collapsed and was put to bed.   When 
Blackman emerged from the bedroom, everyone was gone except the tolerant 
Lord Thomson, who stayed and chatted with him for half an hour, 
and then Blackman lay awake most of that night, despairing of what he 
must expect on the Continent. Finally, at dawn, he fell asleep, and 
when he awoke and came into the living room, he found Lewis in his pajamas 
before the fire, smoking a cigarette. Blackman said that he wanted 
to apologize for not having prevented Lewis from making that horrible 
spectacle of himself, that he should have seized him by the neck 
at once and forcibly hauled him into his bedroom. Lewis warned him never 
to lay a hand on him, and then Blackman asked for his fare back 
to the United States. Lewis looked at him and began to cry, and then, 
saying that he was going to make a promise, he asked Blackman to call 
the porter and to tell him to take out all the liquor that he did 
not want. "And from now on, for the rest of this trip, I will only 
drink what you agree that I should drink". Blackman called the porter 
and had him remove everything but one bottle of brandy, and after 
that they would have a cocktail or two before dinner, or, on one of their 
walking trips, beer, or, in France and Italy, wine in moderation.

Lewis gave him a guidebook tour of London and, motoring and 
walking, took him to Stratford, but the London stay was for only ten 
days, and on the twentieth they took the train for Southampton, where 
they spent the night for an early morning Channel crossing. Near 
Southampton, in a considerable establishment, lived Homer Vachell, 
a well-known pulp writer, and his brother, Horace- both friends of 
Lewis's. He suggested that they call on these brothers, who received 
them pleasantly. Then they returned to their hotel and got ready 
for bed. It was late, and Blackman was ready to go to sleep, but Lewis 
was not. He said, "We had a good time tonight, didn't we, Earl"? 
Earl agreed, and Lewis said that it would have been very different 
if his wife had been with him. Then he kept Blackman awake 
for more than an hour while he did an imaginary dialogue between his wife 
and himself in which, discussing the evening, he was continually berated. 
He began the dialogue by having his wife announce that one does 
not invade people's homes without warning them that one is coming, 
and went on from that with the entire catalogue of his social gaucheries. 
From 1613 on, if the lists exist, they contain between twenty to thirty 
names. As the total number of incepting bachelors in 1629 was, according 
to Masson (<Life>, 1:218 and ~n), two hundred fifty-nine, 
the twenty-four names listed in the <ordo senioritatis> for that 
year constitute slightly less than one tenth of the total number of bachelors 
who then incepted. There were four from St& John's and 
four from Christ's, three from Pembroke, and two from each of the 
colleges, Jesus, Peterhouse, Queens', and Trinity, with Caius, 
Clare, King's, Magdalene, and Sidney supplying one each in the <ordo 
senioritatis>. The list was headed by [Henry] Hutton of St& 
John's who was matriculated from St& John's at Easter, 
1625. He became a fellow of Jesus in 1629, proceeded M&A& from 
Jesus in 1632, and was proctor in 1639-40. The second name was [Edward] 
Kempe, matriculated from Queens' College at Easter, 1625. 
He proceeded M&A& in 1632, and B&D& in 1639, being made 
fellow in 1632. He was ordained deacon 16 June and priest 22 December 
1633. The third name was [John] Ravencroft, who was admitted 
to the Inner Temple in November 1631. The fourth name was [John] 
Milton of Christ's College, followed by [Richard] Manningham 
of Peterhouse, who matriculated 16 October 1624. Venn gave his B&A& 
as 1624, a mistake for 1629. Manningham also proceeded M&A& 
in 1632 and became a fellow of his college in that year. [John] 
Boutflower of Christ's was twelfth in the list, coming from Perse 
School under Mr& Lovering as pensioner 20 April 1625 under Mr& 
Alsop. The fourteenth name was [Richard] Buckenham, written 
Buckman, admitted to Christ's College under Scott 2 July 1625. 
The fifteenth name was [Thomas] Baldwin, admitted to Christ's 
4 March 1625 under Alsop. Christ's College was well represented 
that year in the <ordo>, and the name highest on the list from that 
college was Milton's, fourth in the entire university. Small wonder 
that Milton later boasted of how well his work had been received 
there, since he attained a rank in the order of commencing bachelors higher 
than that of any other inceptor from Christ's of that year.

It is not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangements whereby 
these honors lists were then made up or even how the names that they 
contained assumed the order in which we find them. The process usually 
began with a tutor boasting about a boy, as Chappell had boasted about 
Lightfoot, to the higher officers of the college and university. 
Then the various officers of the college might take up the case. It 
would, however, reach the proctors and other officers in charge of the 
public-school performances of the incepting bachelors, and the place 
that any individual obtained in the lists depended greatly on how he comported 
himself in the public schools during his acts therein as he was 
incepting. Of course the higher officials could add or place a name 
on the list wherever they wished. Milton's name being fourth is neither 
too high nor too low to be assigned to the arbitrary action of 
vice-chancellor, proctor, master, or other mighty hand. He evidently 
earned the place assigned him. 

#RECAPITULATION OF MILTON'S UNDERGRADUATE 
CAREER#

Looking back from the spring of 1629 over the four years 
of Milton's undergraduate days, certain phases of his college 
career stand out as of permanent consequence to him and hence to us. Of 
course the principal factor in the whole experience was the kind of 
education he received. It differed from what an undergraduate receives 
today from any American college or university mainly in the certainty 
of what he was forced to learn compared with the loose and widely 
scattered information obtained today by most of our undergraduates. Milton 
was required to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge 
of Latin grammar, logic-rhetoric, ethics, physics or natural philosophy, 
metaphysics, and Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He had also 
sampled various special fields of learning, being unable to miss some 
study of divinity, Justinian (law), and Galen (medicine). Above all, 
he had learned to write formal Latin prose and verse to a remarkable 
degree of artistry. He had learned to dispute devastatingly, both formally 
and informally in Latin, and according to the rules on any topic, 
pro or con, drawn from almost any subject, more especially from Aristotle's 
works. He could produce carefully constructed orations, 
set and formal speeches, artfully and prayerfully made by writing and 
rewriting with all the aid his tutor and others could provide, and then 
delivered verbatim from memory. He had also learned to dispute extempore 
remarkably well, the main evidence for which of course is the presence 
of his name in the honors list of 1628/29. He also displayed 
the ability to write Latin verse on almost any topic of dispute, the 
verses, of course, to be delivered from memory. Then we have surviving 
at least one instance of a poem prepared for another in <Naturam non 
Pati Senium>, and perhaps also the <De Idea Platonica>. But 
his greatest achievement, in his own eyes and in the eyes of his colleagues 
and teachers, was his amazing ability to produce literary Latin 
pieces, and he was often called on to do so. These were his public 
academic activities, <domi forisque>, in the college and in the university. 
And his performances attracted much attention, as the frequency 
of his surviving pieces in any calendar that may be set up for his 
undergraduate activities testifies.   His other activities are 
not so easily recovered. His statements about sports and exercises of 
a physical nature are suggestive, but inconclusive. His later boastings 
of his skill with the small sword are indicative of much time and 
practice devoted to the use of that weapon. Venn and others have dealt 
with sports and pastimes at Cambridge in Milton's day with not very 
specific results. Milton himself, uncommunicative as he is about 
his lesser and nonliterary activities, at least gives us some evidence 
that he was a great walker, under any and all conditions. His early 
poems and some of his prose prolusions speak of wanderings in the city 
and the neighboring country that may be extended to Cambridge and its 
surrounding countryside. The town itself and the "reedy Cam" he 
often visited, as did all in the university. The churches, the taverns, 
and the various other places of the town must have known his figure 
well as he roved to and about them. The tiny hamlet of Chesterton 
to the north, with the fens and marshes lying on down the Ouse River, 
may have attracted him often, as it did many other youths of the time. 
The Gog Magog Hills to the southeast afforded him and all other 
students a vantage point from which to view the town and university 
of their dwelling. The country about Cambridge is flat and not particularly 
spectacular in its scenery, though it offers easy going to the
