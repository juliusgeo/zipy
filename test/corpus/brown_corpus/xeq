called "facing point locks".   Figs& 1-6 show typical arrangements 
of track and signals. Each diagram is accompanied by a "dog 
chart", a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular 
lever will lock if pulled. The lines connecting the wedge-shaped 
dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.

By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several 
other details. Derails- mechanical track devices that actually guide 
the wheels off the rails if a train passes a "stop" signal- are 
used in many instances. "Home" signals have two blades. The blacked-in 
blades indicate a fixed aspect- the blade does not move. As 
an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal 
is seen in advance when he passes the "distant" signal located 
beyond the limits of the interlocking plant. In some low-speed situations, 
the distant signal is fixed at caution. In other instances where 
there is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only green 
and yellow aspects.   So much for the prototype.   The interlocking 
frame we built at the MODEL RAILROADER workshop and then 
installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig& 1 scheme 
and is shown beginning in Fig& 7, page 65, and in the photos. Here's 
how it can be built. 

#FRAME#

The sizes of pieces needed 
for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig& 7, most 
of the bars being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths. 
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers 
and locks as you wish. Our instructions assume you are building 
this particular frame, which is for a junction.   When cutting 
the pieces, dress the ends smooth, and square with a smooth file or sanding 
disk. Start with the right-hand piece "~B", **f, soldering 
it to the lower piece "~A" of the same material but 12'' 
long. Let exactly 1'' of "~A" extend beyond "~B" and 
use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.   Now 
lay 12 pieces of **f cut 5-3/4'' long side by side but separated 
by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' sq&. This gives you the 
spacing for locating the left-hand piece "~B". Compress the assembly 
when you make the mark to show the location for "~B". Solder 
this second "~B" to "~A" at right angles. There 
should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be 
1'' from an end of the long piece.   Cap this assembly (with 
spacing bars in place) with a **f bar. Tack-solder all the 1/2'' 
sq& pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members. These will be drilled 
and tapped later on.   Now cut five **f locking bar spacers 
(which run horizontally). Position these using six intermediate temporary 
**f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar "~A". Solder 
it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame. Now place 12 pieces 
1/2'' sq& on this edge as we did before and space them with 
the 5-3/4'' long "tappets", as they are called. Cap with a **f 
bar and tack-solder in place. Cap the locking bar spacers with two 
**f directly under the first two "~B" pieces. Remove all the 
loose spacing bars.   Mark and center-punch all the holes required 
for screws to hold this assembly together. See Fig& 7. Placement 
of these holes is not critical, but they should be located so that 
the centers are about 1/8'' from any edge. Drill all No& 50 and 
counter-drill all except the "~A" pieces size 43. Tap the "~A" 
pieces 2-56.   Now unsolder and disassemble the frame 
except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ("~A" 
and "~B" pieces), which are soldered together. Either lay 
the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters 
so they may be replaced in their proper positions. Dress all surfaces 
with a file, cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.

Drill 20 No& 47 holes in the upper piece "~A" as shown in 
Fig& 7. Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later 
on. Note 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.

Now reassemble the frame, using **f roundhead steel screws and nuts. 
Put the 12 tappets and some **f locking bar spacers in the frame to 
help align all the components before you tighten the screws. Be sure 
the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq& spacer. As 
an anchor for the spring lock, insert a **f bar in the lower left corner 
of the frame as shown in Fig& 7. Drill a No& 43 hole through 
the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw. Drill two No& 50 
holes, one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly 
above it, and tap 2-56. Number all the tappet bars before removing them 
so they can be replaced in the same slots. Remove all other loose 
pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth. Cut five pieces 
of **f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long. These are supporting members 
for the short locking bars. Locate their positions in Fig& 7 and 
drill No& 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame. Cut off 
excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut. Drill 
four No& 19 and four No& 28 holes in the 12'' long "~A" 
pieces. Locate the position from Fig& 7. 

#TAPPETS AND LOCKING 
BARS#

Draw-file No& 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective 
slot and square the ends. Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree 
chamfer. Drill a No& 50 hole 1-1/4'' from one end and tap 
2-56. (See Fig& 7.) Put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole, cut 
off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar. 
To find the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into the frame 
and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge. Scribe a line 
across the bar on the other end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the 
diameter of the 2-56 screw head (about 5/64'') away from the frame 
edge. Total distance is about 21/64''. Tend to make this dimension 
slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 
1/4'' tappet movement. Drill a No& 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert 
a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end. Drill a No& 
47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in 
Figs& 
7 and 8. Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet 
bars.   To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a **f piece of 
brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs& 6 and 8. These 
will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.   Fitting 
the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job 
since stop screws, tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced 
many times. As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become 
a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before 
the part you are working on is accessible. A little extra work 
here will pay off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are finished. 
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work 
progresses to insure snug fitting.   The order of fitting is not 
too important. However, we started with the first row of bars and worked 
our way back. Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs 
and notches is used throughout, we will only describe the construction 
of one locking bar. Figs& 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions. 
All the bars are cut from **f brass. The lengths of each piece are 
listed at the bottom of Fig& 7. Bar "~C" is 2-3/4'' long. 
Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put a slight chamfer 
on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.   Fig& 8 gives 
the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes. Center-punch and drill 
the No& 31 hole 7/16'' from one end of the bar. Chuck a length 
of 1/8'' dia& drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning 
device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file 
a slight taper 1/8'' long. Cut the piece about 9/32'' or 5/16'' 
long and drive it into the No& 31 hole drilled in the locking 
bar. File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' 
above the bar. This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.

Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3. 
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of 
tappet 3, parallel to piece "~A". See the drawings for the shape 
of the notch. Scribe ~V-shaped lines on the bar and rough out 
with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool. We used 
the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about .020'' thick and 
1'' dia& fitted on a 1/8'' dia& mandrel. Such disks are 
very handy for cutting and shaping small parts. File to a smooth finish. 
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular 
shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without 
marring an adjoining one. Endeavor to get the notches as much alike 
as possible. The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel 
dog will slide easily over it. Assemble the parts in the frame and 
test the sliding action of the mating pieces. All matching surfaces 
should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis. 
Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia& drill rod in a 
drill press or 
electric hand tool. Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' 
long on one end, using Swiss pattern files. This tool can also be 
made with a lathe.

Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on 
mathematics. Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes 
of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round 
would not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and communicating 
the things they discover and learn. Math and the formulas that 
allow it to be applied to different problems are, therefore, essential 
to any scientific endeavor.   Hot rodding is a science. It's 
not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate 
on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit 
but it is, nevertheless, a science. But because science is based on mathematics 
doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician. 
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years 
without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems; 
however, he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and 
the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few 
formulas that apply to rodding.   A mathematical formula is nothing 
more than a pattern for solving a specific problem. It places the 
various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation 
to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can 
be computed.   The first step in using a formula is to insert the 
numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions 
in the formula. This changes the formula to an "equation". The 
equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.

Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated. They involve 
only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic 
classes. However, it is essential that the various mathematical symbols 
used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes 
can be done properly and in their correct order. They indicate 
simple division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.   The 
symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers 
placed one above the other. The lower number is always divided into the 
upper number: **f   The symbol for multiplication is "~@". 
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row. For example: 
**f Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any 
order. The result will be the same regardless of the order used.

The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign. This is 
nothing more than a dash. It separates two or more numbers. The number 
on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on 
the left of the symbol. For example: **f When more than two figures 
are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried 
out from the left to right if the result is to be correct. For example, 
for the problem **f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals 
9.   Addition is indicated by the ~+ symbol. The symbol is 
used to separate two or more numbers. For example: **f Numbers separated
