just not big enough. We have a few 'consultants'- retired engineers 
retained and called in on certain problems. The only 'fellows' 
in our company are those who have been honored by ~ASME, ~AIEE 
or ~AIChE **h I am sure that the engineer who enters 
management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities 
than he would have as a technical specialist- because of his wider 
accountability". 

_ANOTHER STRUCTURE_ "We have tried to make both 
paths attractive, so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction 
in either. One way to formalize this is in the job structure. 
We have these positions, which compare directly: **f   "Above 
these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president 
of ~Engrg, ~R + ~D. The latter jobs include major management 
responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily 
through the engineering-management side **h {We have not yet 
succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable 
to our higher levels of management, but I believe we will trend 
in this direction} **h but not to exceed vice-president". _TOP 
JOB: RESEARCH SCIENTIST_ "Approximately four years ago, we 
initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons **h The 
highest position is known as a 'research scientist'. This approach 
has not been entirely satisfactory. The primary deterrent appears to 
lie with the technical people themselves, and their concept of what 
constitutes status in present-day society. {Scientists who agitate 
hardest 
for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept 
it **h We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private 
offices and private secretaries are extremely important;} and although 
we have attempted to provide these status symbols, support of the 
'dual-ladder' plan has been half-hearted **h despite the creation 
of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that 
of men in top managerial positions.   {"A serious problem 
accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly 
defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.} 
With no set standards, there is the tendency to promote to the 
next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless 
of performance **h {promotion is too often based on longevity and 
time in salary grade instead of merit.} If no specific organization 
plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level, 
the result is a department top-heavy with high-level, high-salaried personnel". 
_STAFF ENGINEER @ DEPT MANAGER_ "We have two approaches 
for the technical man: the position of staff engineer, which 
is rated as high in salary as department manager; and an administrative 
organization to take the routine load away from department managers 
and project engineers as much as possible, thus allowing them more time 
for strictly technical work. These are only halfway measures, and 
the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man 
in industry **h to progress without limit in salary and prestige". 
_A COMPLETE PLAN_ "We have made limited application of the 'parallel 
ladder' plan. The highest rated non-supervisory engineering 
title is 'research engineer'. The salary schedule permits remuneration 
greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering 
supervision (engineering section head). We also have an 'engineering 
section head- research engineer' classification which has salary 
possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer. Above this 
point there is no generally used parallel ladder.   "We also 
do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a 
'professional' 
and also to give public recognition to individual technical 
competence. {These include encouragement of, and assistance 
to, the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers. 
We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity, a magazine 
widely distributed both within and without the company, and an 
information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes 
of all engineers.} Publicity is given to the award of patents to 
our egnineers and financial support is provided for individual membership 
in technical societies.   "A recent, and more pertinent action, 
has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the 
vice-president for Engineering. This function is staffed by engineers 
chosen for their technical competence and who have the title, member 
of the technical staff'. Salaries compare favorably with those paid 
to the first two or three levels of management. Additional symbols 
of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive badge passes 
authorizing special privileges, and a difference in the treatment 
of financial progress through merit.   "We presently are involved 
in inaugurating a new development center. Operations of this nature 
offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status. All scientific 
staff members will have the title, 'research-staff member'. 
The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the 
scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific 
field. Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations, 
the position to which research-staff members report administratively will 
not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member, 
therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as highly.   "These 
recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number 
of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence. It 
is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result 
entirely from company efforts. Fundamental to the difficulty of creating 
the desired prestige is the fact that, in the business community, 
prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that 
one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in 
the management functions".

SIXTY MILES NORTH of New York City where the wooded hills 
of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there 
is a new home development called "Oakwood Heights". As a matter 
of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated 
county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages 
in the $14,000 range. But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular 
**h its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line 
that starts at a central storage point.   This is a pilot operation 
sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-State 
Pipeline Corporation, with principal offices in New York State. 
Its president is Otis M& Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen 
+ Waters, 5404 Chrysler Bldg&, New York City. Vice-president 
is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter. 
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-Craft 
Distributors, Inc&, Newburgh, N&Y&.   The idea 
of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty. 
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U& S& 
and Canada, even overseas, write to FUELOIL + OIL HEAT to inquire 
if it's feasible and where it is being done. Its editors only 
knew of one example to point to, a public housing development of 278 
homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue. 
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern 
among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered. Rather 
the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis 
of number of rooms and persons in the family.   Common complaints 
included "Mrs& Murphy" leaving her windows open all the time, 
a fresh air fan, or the family was visiting "Aunt Minnie" with 
the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil. As a 
result of that attitude, others have been discouraged from trying central 
distribution.   A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks 
the situation at Oakwood Heights. Called a "Slo-Flo" meter 
it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles, 
a key individual being Don Nelson. Tri-State has acquired 
its exclusive distribution for the northern, principal heating states.

There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-State headed 
by a lawyer. The earlier New Haven development was public housing, 
so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture. These 
have to do with property rights, municipal official attitudes and 
a host of others. In working out the practical legal conclusions President 
Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project, for it is 
planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments 
nationally.   It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming, 
to get approval of any kind of line under a public street, as one 
example. To overcome this, the builder lays and completes the street 
himself, then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual 
easement for the oil lines. When a family buys a home the title is subject 
to a perpetual easement to Tri-State. For the central storage, 
Tri-State buys one acre, Buries its tanks and simply holds permanent 
title to that piece. In other words, the whole storage and pipeline 
system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather 
to Tri-State.   How does Tri-State get its revenue from this 
plan? It leases the whole facility to a large oil company, at least 
large enough to have a strong credit position. This first test is 
being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 
15 years. The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-State for the use 
of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all 
the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable 
to both parties.   On this first venture the central storage is 
20,000 gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons for each of 
the 50 homes. The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport 
loads, so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather 
contingencies. However, that is not all he has to do. He must 
undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine 
heating. In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water 
form Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot 
water hookups. Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals 
as he finds best.   For this first development the supplier 
signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being 
transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor. The major 
gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor 
apparently can do well because delivery cost is low. 

#INITIAL 
CONSIDERATIONS#

The officers of the new corporation have naturally 
explored many angles, as well as personalities that might be affected. 
For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie town (township) where the 
project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow 
clearing problem. The central storage is near a main artery quite 
easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing, with fewer 
trucks in the residential streets.   The Public Service Commission 
has ruled that this is not a public utility, subject to 
their 
many regulations.   Several financial institutions, both banks 
and insurance companies, have been sounded out. They like it and would 
supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong 
oil companies.   The Government housing agencies consider it 
feasible with one special stipulation. There must be a restriction in 
the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the 
current market price for the oil **h an obvious precaution, since the 
account is permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.

For a few details of the system **h the lines are 1-1/4'' 
<X-Tru-Coat,> a product of Republic Steel Corp&, and all lines 
are welded. They are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some 
areas four feet down, particularly under roads, to stay clear of all 
other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy 
trucking. The meter is mounted high on the basement wall. Its figures 
are a half inch high and very easy to read, even into tenth gallons. 
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.

Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total cost of all the 
heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than 
would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.
