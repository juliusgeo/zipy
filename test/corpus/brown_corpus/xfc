you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when 
your pool will hardly look its best. It may be a big hole in the ground 
filled with salt hay, or an ice floe studded with logs. Even a 
neat, plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold. (We do, 
however, recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk- 
flora and fauna generally- from accidentally wintering in the 
pool.)   Probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts. 
Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and 
size of your land. But if space and money are no problem and small children 
are not on hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have 
your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs 
of the house. And a good several feet around the pool should be neither 
greensward nor woods, but good hard pavement.   The placement 
of your pool, however, will not of itself solve the two major problems 
of pool owning- those that involve your social life and those pertaining 
to safety. Coping with them demands stern discipline- of yourself 
as well as of your family, neighbors, friends and anyone you ever 
talked to on a transoceanic jet.   Eight years ago while we were 
going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were 
each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings 
to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid 
out nearby for the lord and master's delectation. But not even our 
first pool-side 
gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies. 
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own 
backyards. Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled. 
Had we taken a lien on a state park? Not at all. We had merely been 
discovered by the pool sharks. We were in business!   From 
proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step- 
no more than the change from city clothes to trunks. Nai^ve of us, 
maybe, but the results of our impulsive invitations to "come over 
next summer and swim in our new pool" were both unexpected and unsettling. 

#OUR BOOK OF ETIQUETTE#

After the first few weeks, it was 
obvious that rules had to be made, laid down and obeyed- even if our 
popularity ratings became subnormal as a result. So rules we made, 
in unabashed collusion. Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided 
precisely, we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single 
social code for pool owners.   First and foremost: No one- 
no, not anyone- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations 
to his or her own circle. Just short of forty lashes we finally managed 
to coerce our children to this view. Their friends and ours are 
welcome to share the pool, but on our terms and at our times. 
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning 
beforehand.   No ringers, either- even if they are trailing 
legitimate invitees. We want to know when the Potlatches telephone 
exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that we won't 
end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August.

No young children may come without adults except for a specific, 
organized, chaperoned party. And accompanying adults are urged to 
keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities. A gaggle 
of gabbling mothers, backs to the pool, is no safeguard.   No bottle 
pool is tolerated- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come 
to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk 
and run. (Sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant took 
a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood 
free-drink stop.)   We designated one day a week as the time 
when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours. This has 
saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less 
brutal to the young "less fortunate" than ours.   We also 
worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours 
early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco 
lunch <en famille>. We gently usher them to an island of tables 
and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where 
they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.   All 
dressing (undressing to be more exact) must be done in our small bath 
house or at the swimmers' homes. (To avoid any possible excuse for 
a dripping parade through your house, it is a good idea to have a telephone 
extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between 
the pool and the parking area.) We do, however, provide a limited 
number of extra suits, mainly for children, and we stock extra towels 
and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences. Life-preservers, the buckle-on 
kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness, too, for the very young. 

#PRESERVING LIFE AND LIMB#

Safety rules, of course, are more 
important than all the others put together.   In many localities, 
now, the law requires all pools to be fenced, usually to a minimum 
height of 5 feet. But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place 
for running or horseplay. We allow no underwater endurance contests, 
either, or inexpert versions of water polo.   Diving boards must 
have non-skid surfaces (coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine 
and rots quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent). And 
divers must be enjoined to look before they leap, either on top of 
someone else or onto a pool edge.   Our pools also have wide, shallow 
steps- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus 
be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.

All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool 
and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.

When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend- for your 
own mental health- a good long chat with your insurance agent. You 
should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty 
pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.

Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen. They are the 
result of a constant and careful contest with the elements. Unless 
you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your 
leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and 
feeding- from ~pH content to filtering and vacuuming- is best left 
to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service. Of course, if your 
pool is close to the house, your wife can always add it to her housekeeping 
chores (you hope). Or you can make pool care the price of swimming 
for teen-agers. Even so, every pool owner, in case of emergency, 
should have some idea of what makes things work. A brief course in 
hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future 
crisis. 

#PRESERVING THE POOL#

A sudden high rise in temperature 
will turn your pool poison green overnight. You need more chlorine. The 
walls feel slippery. You need algaecide. With or without professional 
help, you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself 
unless you have a full-time pool nurse.   You should see to it 
that the trap, the dirt-catcher in front of the filter, is always clean. 
A pool is no place for a shut trap.   You should firmly insist 
that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water. When shed, 
they leave rust marks.   You can hope against hope that come spring 
cleaning, your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing 
and furbishing. It has happened.   Many hours of spring cleaning 
will be saved, however, if you remove the main drain grate when you 
close the pool season in the fall. As the pool is emptied, stand by 
to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet. Much of 
the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp, but requires dynamite 
if allowed to dry. If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you may 
easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out. Of course, when 
your 6-inch torrent of water is released, it may cause a lot of comment 
as it passes through or by neighboring properties. Do not forget 
this possibility.   If your pool is located on or near sloping 
ground, it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable 
than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping 
out the water and then scooping out all the debris.   It may be 
true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene, but lights also attract 
all the insect life for miles around. Once on the water, these 
little visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming 
problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those 
present. Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light 
you need at much less expense.   Our experience has taught 
us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible, from pipes to 
brushes. 
Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be sure that one 
person (in the family or not) is regularly responsible for each aspect 
of the job, with no chance for claiming, "It wasn't my turn".

Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves- 
even if the little boys do want to play space ship. You may find yourself 
hitting bottom, literally, as you discover that water is running 
out even while you are putting it in.

DRAW a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania. 
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning 
will be <obsolete in 10 years>. Fortunately, it is the ~FHA 
which has arrived at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment 
of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and thus acquired 
with a minimum of financial stress. Even if you live above that line, 
the ~FHA will back you, for they have decided that the inclusion 
of air conditioning in <all> new homes is a good thing and should 
be encouraged.   New simplified packaged units, recently devised 
prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on techniques make 
it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as 
little as $600 to $900. Two men can often do the installation in a 
day. You can install it yourself- this is a central system that will 
cool <every part> of your house. Its upkeep? No less an authority 
than the ~FHA concurs that the savings air conditioning makes 
possible more than offset its operating costs. _IS IT WORTH-WHILE?_ 
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days 
of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted. We know 
now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually 
desirable, and accurate controls assure the comfort we want. 
We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer cooling. On the 
contrary, there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills. The filtered 
air benefits allergies, asthma, sinus, hay fever. Control of temperature 
and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid. Heart conditions 
and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive 
heat.   Housekeeping is easier. The cleaner air means 
less time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry cleaners, lighter 
loads for the washing machine. The need for reupholstering, redecorating, 
repainting becomes more infrequent. Clothes hold their shape 
better, and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.   It 
will improve your disposition. When you're less fatigued, things 
just naturally look brighter. The children can have their daytime naps 
and hot meals, and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms. 
You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed and free of 
hot weather nerves.   You can forget about screens, and leave the 
storm windows up all year around.   Best of all, central air conditioning 
is something you can afford. Like its long-lived cousin, 
the refrigerator, a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years 
or more. That brings its per-year cost down mighty low. _FOR ANY 
HOUSE._ No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story, Colonial 
or contemporary, central air conditioning is easily installed. The 
equipment won't take up valuable space either. It can go in out-of-the-way 
waste space.   But there's no denying that the easiest 
and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning 
is when you build. If that's done, the house can be designed
