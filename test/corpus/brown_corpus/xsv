timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification 
of America's first saint in November, 1938, was a fiasco from start 
to finish. As I was playing Mother Cabrini, the picture was actually 
"all mine", with nearly every scene built around me. But in 
order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble, I wrote 
in a part especially for him- that of a dashing ruffian who "sees 
the light" and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini. 
And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf? Did he trouble to 
memorize the very small part which I had "tailor-made" to his specifications, 
a role eventually cut down to three short speeches? Did 
he show the rest of the cast- numbering four thousand- the consideration 
of arriving at the studio punctually- or even at all? <He 
did not!> The "shooting" went on for eight months! Most 
of our working days were spent on the telephone calling "bookies", 
illegal gambling dens, a certain "residential club for young actresses", 
more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the 
athletic club. Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was "hung 
over", uncooperative, rude and insulting. He made many tasteless, 
irreverent and <un>funny remarks, not only about me in the title 
role, but about religion in general. By the time the film was released 
we were three million dollars over-spent, war was imminent and the 
public apparently had forgotten all about Mother Cabrini. Thanks to 
Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me, the notices 
were few and unfavorable. Only George Santayana seemed to understand 
and appreciate the film when he wrote: "Miss Poitrine has perpetrated 
the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed 
by Hollywood". But it was small consolation.   In a rare 
fit of anger and spite, I "farmed out" my own husband to a small 
and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment. 
(An actor must have discipline.) The film was called <The 
Diet of Worms>, which I felt was just what Letch deserved. It 
turned out to be a life of Martin Luther, of all things! It was 
a disaster! In clothes, Letch simply did not project. He was laughed 
off the screen. At the same time, however, I availed myself of the 
services of that great English actor and master of make-up, Sir Gauntley 
Pratt, to do a "quickie" called <The Mystery of the Mad 
Marquess>, in which I played a young American girl who inherits 
a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages 
and sliding panels and, unbeknownst to anyone, is still occupied 
by an eccentric maniac. It was a "potboiler" made on a "shoestring" 
and not the sort of film I like, as all I had to do was look 
blank and scream a great deal. My heart was not in it, but, oddly 
enough, it remains the most financially successful picture of my career. 
(I watched it on television late one night last week and it "stands 
up" remarkably well, even twenty years later.)   Letch had 
returned from his <debacle> unrepentant and more badly behaved than 
before. I really loved that boy, and, in a feverish attempt to preserve 
our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful, wonderful person 
Letch had once been, I took my troubles to Momma, hoping that her earthy 
advice would help me.   "If I could only think of something 
at the studio, near me, to absorb his boundless energy", I said. 
"What is Letch interested in"?   "Bookies, booze and 
babes", Momma said bluntly.   Her reply stung me, but this 
was too important to let my hurt make any difference. "I can't turn 
the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon", I said.

Up to date, however, his garden was still more or less of a mess, 
he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond 
in the neighborhood he hadn't found it.   It wasn't his fault 
that these things were so. The difficulty was that each day seemed 
to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately.

As a result, life had become a kind of continuous make-ready. 
Once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention, 
he could undertake the things which really counted. Then, at last, 
his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to 
read, or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon, 
accompanied by his dogs.   His dogs? He had almost forgotten 
them, although they had played such an important part in his early 
dreams. Then they had always been romping around him on these walks, 
yelping with delight, dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting 
expeditions, returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws. 
Dogs did something to one's ego. They were constantly assuring 
you that you were one of the world's great guys. Regardless of how 
much of a slob you knew yourself to be, you could be certain they would 
never find out- and even if they did it would make no difference.

Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs 
in the picture. What in the world were you going to do with a lot 
of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons? You certainly 
couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm 
them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused 
that they would have nervous breakdowns. Why in the world couldn't 
he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to?   It 
worried him, this inability to get the simplest things done in the course 
of a day. He would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about 
it. How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business, 
raise a family, be on half a dozen boards, work actively on committees 
and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents 
of a bulging brief case?   Was it possible that as people grow 
older the nature of time changed? Could it be that it speeded up for 
the aged in some mysterious way, as if a bored universe were skipping 
through the end of the chapter just to get it over with? Or was 
the answer less metaphysical? Did older people work more slowly? 
Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter, shave, clean 
out a barn, read a newspaper, than a man of thirty? Did men become 
perfectionists as they grew older, polishing, polishing, reluctant to 
let go?   It might be that certain people were born with a compulsion 
to complicate their lives, while others could live blissfully 
motionless almost indefinitely, like lizards in the sun, too indolent 
to blink their eyes. Perhaps it was his misfortune, or good fortune, 
whichever way one looked at it, to belong to the former group, and he 
was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded 
none, which was positively antagonistic to it.   And then 
again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the 
things he had planned to do after retirement: reading, roaming, gardening, 
lying on his back and watching the clouds go by, was because 
he didn't want to do them. There was no compulsion behind them. They 
could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn. During 
all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done. This 
habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do 
anything for which no one was waiting.   He looked at the luminous 
dial of his wrist watch. It was five minutes after four. On some 
distant farm a rooster crowed and, far down the valley, an associate answered. 
He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head 
against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn.

AT LEAST 
HE COULD BUY THE equipment for his workshop. Thus committed, action 
might follow. He went down to Mills and Bradley's Hardware Store 
and bought a full set of carpenter's tools, including a rotary 
power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr& Mills 
said were essential for babbiting and doweling, whatever <they> 
were. He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools, 
and lumber for his workbench, sandpaper and glue and assorted nails, 
levels and ~T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he 
had 
no idea how to use or what they were for.   "There", said 
Mr& Mills. "That'll get you started. Best not to get everything 
at once. Add things as you find you need 'em".   He didn't 
even ask the cost of this collection. After all, if you were going 
to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that 
was that. When he returned home, the station wagon loaded with tools, 
Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village, using 
the recently purchased second car. He was glad. It gave him a chance 
to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage 
of acid comments. He had made such a fuss about buying that second car 
that he knew he was vulnerable.   He piled everything neatly in 
a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall. 
That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand 
tools. In front of it would be his workbench.   The old nightmare 
which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him 
once more, only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill 
and 
send it away. How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall? 
How did one attach anything to a stone wall, for that matter? 
After the pegboard there would be the paneling. He sat down on an 
old box and focused on the problem. Perhaps one bored holes in the stone 
with some kind of an electric gadget. But then, when you stuck things 
into the holes, why didn't they come right out again? It all 
seemed rather hopeless.   He turned his attention to the workbench. 
Perhaps that was the first thing to do. A workbench had a heavy 
top and sturdy legs, but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top 
so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately 
collapse when you leaned on it?   Mr& Mills had done 
some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of 
boards and two-by-fours which, properly handled, would, he had assured 
him, turn into a workbench. They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly 
pile. Mr& Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot. How could 
anyone know what to do with an assortment like that? Perhaps he 
had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench- 
someone who knew what he was about. Then at least he would 
have a place to hang his tools and something to work on. After that 
everything should be simpler.   He went upstairs to phone Crumb. 
To his amazement he reached him. Mr& Crumb was laid up with a 
bad cold. He didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone 
wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable 
equally lightly. The only trouble was that he himself was tied 
up on the school job. That was why he hadn't been able to finish 
the porch. No, he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter. There 
wasn't any such thing any more. Carpenters all wanted steady work and 
at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could 
hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school 
job.   There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way. Nobody 
liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going 
to be taken drunk. Mr& Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting 
the next night. If he was sober, which was doubtful, he'd have 
him get in touch with Mr& Crombie.   Mr& Blatz had been 
at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to 
be the greatest boon that had come into Mr& Crombie's life since 
he moved to Highfield, in spite of the fact that he didn't work very 
fast or very long at a time, and he didn't like to work at all unless 
Mr& Crombie hung around and talked to him. He said he was the lonely 
type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of 
the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you. So Mr& Crombie 
sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr& Blatz's 
mind from funny things. At the same time he watched carefully to see 
how one attached pegboards to stone walls, but Mr& Blatz was usually 
standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he 
didn't like to disclose his ignorance.   While Mr& Blatz 
was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench, Mr& Crombie 
told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar. 
Mr& Blatz agreed that this would be pretty. Without further discussion 
he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over 
the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling, which he 
then stained and waxed according to his taste.   "Now", he said, 
"we got to put in some outlets for them power tools; then a couple 
of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' I guess we're about
