orthophosphates, borates, carbonates, and silicates are important 
inorganic ingredients of hard-surface cleaners. In addition, the 
polyphosphates are also used, probably acting more as peptizing agents 
than anything else. The importance of the inorganic constituents in 
hard-surface cleaning has been emphasized in a number of papers. 

#PHYSICAL 
CHEMISTRY OF WASHING#

Although there is no question 
but that the process of washing fabrics involves a number of phenomena 
which are related together in an extremely complicated way and that 
these phenomena and their interrelations are not well understood at the 
present, this section attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture 
of the physical chemistry of washing either fabrics or hard surfaces. 
The purpose of washing is, obviously, to remove soils which are arbitrarily 
classed in the four major categories given below: _1._ 
Dirt, which is here defined as particulate material which is usually 
inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit 
colloidal properties. _2._ Greasy soils, which are typified by 
hydrocarbons and fats (esters of glycerol with long-chain organic acids). 
_3._ Stains, which include the wide variety of nonparticulate 
materials which give color even when present in very low concentration 
on the soiled object. _4._ Miscellaneous soils, which primarily 
include sticky substances and colorless liquids which evaporate to leave 
a residue.   The dirt on the soiled objects is mechanically 
held by surface irregularities to some extent. However, a major factor 
in binding dirt is the attraction between surfaces that goes under 
the name of van der Waal's forces. This is a theoretically complicated 
dipole interaction which causes any extremely small uncharged particle 
to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles, or to stick 
to an uncharged surface. Obviously, if colloidal particles bear charges 
of opposite sign or, if one kind is charged and the other kind is 
not, the attraction will be intensified and the tendency to agglomerate 
will be greatly reinforced. Likewise, a charged particle will tend 
to stick to an uncharged surface and <vice versa>, and a charged particle 
will be very strongly attracted to a surface exhibiting an opposite 
charge. In addition, dirt particles can be held onto a soiled surface 
by sticky substances or by the surface tension of liquids, including 
liquid greases.   Greases, stains, and miscellaneous soils 
are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface. In most cases, these soils 
are taken up as liquids through capillary action. In an essentially 
static system, an oil cannot be replaced by water on a surface unless 
the interfacial tensions of the water phase are reduced by a surface-active 
agent.   The washing process whereby soils are removed consists 
basically of applying mechanical action to loosen the dirt particles 
and dried matter in the presence of water which helps to float off 
the debris and acts, to some extent, as a dissolving and solvating 
agent. Greasy soils are hardly removed by washing in plain water; 
and 
natural waters, in addition, often contain impurities such as calcium 
salts which can react with soils to make them more difficult to remove. 
Therefore, detergents are used. The detergent active is that substance 
which primarily acts to remove greasy soils. The other constituents 
in a built detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stains 
and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils.   As is well known, 
detergent actives belong to the chemical class consisting of moderately 
high molecular weight and highly polar molecules which exhibit the 
property of forming micelles in solution. Physicochemical investigations 
of anionic surfactants, including the soaps, have shown that there 
is little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anions below 
a certain region of concentration called the critical micelle concentration. 
(1) Below the critical micelle concentration, monomers and some 
dimers are present. (2) In the critical micelle region, there is 
a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelles, which have 
a degree of polymerization averaging around 60-80. (3) For anionics, 
these micelles appear to be roughly spherical assemblages in which 
the hydrocarbon tails come together so that the polar groups (the ionized 
ends) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase. Obviously 
hydrophobic 
(oleophilic) substances such as greases, oils, or particles having 
a greasy or oily surface are more at home in the center of a micelle 
than in the aqueous phase. Micelles can imbibe and hold a considerable 
amount of oleophilic substances so that the micelle volume may be 
increased as much as approximately two-fold. Although the matter has 
not been unequivocally demonstrated, the available data show that micelles 
in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process.

Related to micelle formation is the technologically important 
ability of detergent actives to congregate at oil-water interfaces 
in such a manner that the polar (or ionized) end of the molecule is directed 
towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the 
oily phase. In the cleaning process, sorbed greasy soils become coated 
in this manner with an oriented film of surfactant. Then during washing, 
the greasy soil rolls back at the edges so that emulsified droplets 
can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass, with the aid of 
mechanical action, and enter the aqueous phase. Obviously, a substance 
which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of 
the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off 
the greasy soil.   Substances other than detergent actives also 
tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surfaces of other 
contiguous condensed phases. This is particularly true of highly charged 
ions, especially those ions which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes. 
Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent is strongly 
sorbed at oil-water interfaces, the highly charged ions are most strongly 
sorbed at interfaces between water and insoluble materials exhibiting 
an ionic structure (see Table 26-2 on p& 1678). Thus, for aqueous 
media, we can think of the idealized organic active as an oleophilic 
or hydrophobic surface-active agent, and of an idealized builder as 
a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent.   From the equilibrium 
sorption data which are available, it seems logical to expect 
that polyphosphate ions would be strongly sorbed on the surface of 
the dirt (especially clay soils) so as to give it a greatly increased 
negative charge. The charged particles then repel each other and are 
also repelled from the charged surface, which almost invariably bears 
a negative charge under washing conditions. The negatively charged dirt 
particles then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase. This 
hypothesis is evolved in analogy to the demonstrated action of organic 
actives in detergency. It does not consider the kinetic effects 
of the phosphate builders on sorption-desorption phenomena which will 
be discussed later (see pp& 1746-1748).   The crude picture of 
the detergency process thus far developed can be represented as: **f 
The influence of mechanical action on the particles of free soil may 
be compared to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale. Freed soil 
must be dispersed and protected against flocculation. Cleaned cloth 
must be protected against the redeposition of dispersed soil. It is 
evident that the requirements imposed by these effects upon any one 
detergent constituent acting alone are severe.   Upon consideration 
of the variety of soils and fabrics normally encountered in the washing 
process, it is little wonder that the use of a number of detergent 
constituents having "synergistic" properties has gained widespread 
acceptance. In the over-all process, it is difficult to assign a 
"pure" role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation; 
and, indeed, there is no more reason to separate the interrelated roles 
of the active, builder, antiredeposition agent, etc& than there 
is to assign individual actions to each of the numerous isomers making 
up a given commercial organic active.

The thermal exchange of chlorine between **f and liquid **f is 
readily measurable at temperatures in the range of 180` and above. The 
photochemical exchange occurs with a quantum yield of the order of 
unity in the liquid phase at 65` using light absorbed only by the **f. 
In the gas phase, with **f of **f and **f of **f, quantum yields 
of the 
order of **f have been observed at 85`. Despite extensive attempts 
to obtain highly pure reagents, serious difficulty was experienced in 
obtaining reproducible rates of reaction. It appears possible to set 
a lower limit of about **f for the activation energy of the abstraction 
of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine 
atom to form **f radical. The rate of the gas phase exchange reaction 
appears to be proportional to the first power of the absorbed light 
intensity indicating that the radical intermediates are removed at 
the walls or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular 
radical combination reactions. 

#INTRODUCTION#

Because of the simplicity 
of the molecules, isotopic exchange reactions between elemental 
halogens and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer 
particularly fruitful possibilities for obtaining unambiguous basic 
kinetic data. It would appear that it should be possible to determine 
unique mechanisms for the thermal and photochemical reactions in both 
the liquid and gas phases and to determine values for activation energies 
of some of the intermediate reactions of atoms and free radicals, 
as well as information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen 
bond. The reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seemed 
particularly suited for such studies. It should be possible to prepare 
very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chlorides on a vacuum 
system followed by multiple distillation of the liquid. It should be 
possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfering substances by 
the usual purification methods followed by prechlorination prior to 
addition of radioactive chlorine. Furthermore, the exchange would not 
be expected to be sensitive to trace amounts of impurities because it 
would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for 
abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expected to be 
too high; also it would be expected that **f would compete very effectively 
with any impurities as a scavenger for **f radicals. Contrary 
to these expectations we have found it impossible to obtain the degree 
of reproducibility one would wish, even with extensive efforts to prepare 
especially pure reagents. We are reporting these investigations 
here briefly because of their relevancy to problems of the study of apparently 
simple exchange reactions of chlorine and because the results 
furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of 
chlorine atoms from carbon tetrachloride. 

#EXPERIMENTAL#

_REAGENTS._- 
Matheson highest purity tank chlorine was passed through a 
tube of resublimed **f into an evacuated Pyrex system where it was condensed 
with liquid air. It was then distilled at least three times 
from a trap at -78` to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction 
being retained in each distillation. The purified product was 
stored at -78` in a tube equipped with a break seal.   Of several 
methods employed for tagging chlorine with radiochlorine, the exchange 
of inactive chlorine with tagged aluminum chloride at room temperature 
was found to be the most satisfactory. To prepare the latter, 
silver chloride was precipitated from a solution containing **f obtained 
from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The silver chloride was 
fused under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chips with the resultant 
product of **f which was sublimed into a flask on the vacuum line. 
Previously purified chlorine was subsequently admitted and the exchange 
was allowed to take place. The radiochlorine was stored at -78` 
in a tube equipped with a break seal.   Liter quantities of Mallinckrodt, 
low sulfur, reagent grade carbon tetrachloride were saturated 
with **f and **f and illuminated for about 50 hours with a 1000 watt 
tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inches. The mixture was then extracted 
with alkali and with water following which the carbon tetrachloride
