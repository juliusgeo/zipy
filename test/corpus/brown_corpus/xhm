Dulles's first two years in office, while Republicans ran the 
Senate, the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for 
its 
blood since 1945.   An internal police operation managed by Scott 
McLeod, a former F&B&I& man installed as security officer 
upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance. So was 
the attack upon Charles E& Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him 
Ambassador to Moscow. The principal mauler, however, was Senator 
Joseph McCarthy. Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle 
for the Department, Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates. 
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats, 
Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men 
had their way.   In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede 
that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention 
by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him 
and the country's foreign policy. In any event, the example of Acheson's 
trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke 
it. He elected to "get along".   During this dark chapter 
in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas 
later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol 
Hill. Their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious 
logic of the time, with present treasonous intent. Their successors, 
absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.   This, 
in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats 
took control. In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually 
barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit 
the Russians. For three or four years in the mid-1950's, this 
complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there 
was a dull legislative afternoon. It became smart to say that the fault 
was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by 
anyone but himself.   An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth 
of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying 
anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation. #@ 
GETTING ALONG WITH FOREIGNERS#

THERE ARE ninety-eight foreign 
embassies and legations in Washington. They range from the Soviet 
Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a 
funeral-accessories 
display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called 
"that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street", the modern cement-and-glass 
chancery of the Belgians.   Here is the world of the 
chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers 
and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher, 
and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired 
Lothario.   Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries 
around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions 
on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies. 
Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty, 
the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner. 
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting 
to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington. 
Some, like the British and the French, maintain an elaborate 
system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special 
areas of the American scene. Other embassies cable home <The 
New York Times> without changing a comma.   Each has its peculiar 
style. The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage 
headquarters. When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over 
in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change 
this idea. Menshikov hit Washington with a ~TV announcer's 
grin and a hearty handclasp. To everyone's astonishment he seemed 
no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt 
was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.   Where his predecessors 
had glowered, Menshikov smiled. Where they had affected the 
bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, Menshikov went abroad 
gorgeous in white tie and tails. Overnight he became the most available 
man in Washington. Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the 
vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club 
alike. In Senator Joseph McCarthy's phrase, it was the most 
unheard-of thing ever heard of. A newspaperman who met him at a reception 
swore that he asked Menshikov: "What should we call you"? 
And that Menshikov replied: "Just call me Mike". 
"Smilin' Mike" was the sobriquet Washington gave him. His English 
was usable and he used it fearlessly. Toasting in champagne one 
night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and 
gaily cried: "Up your bottom"! For a few giddy months that 
coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation 
of Washington. At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts 
complained that the Capitol was out of its wits. Newspaper punditry 
was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to 
smile.   The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians 
usually end. Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable 
because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and "Smilin' 
Mike" dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional 
story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.

The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and the most 
inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians. When King Saud 
visited Washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press 
was the size of his family. Rumor had it that his children numbered 
in the hundreds. The State Department was little help on this, or 
on much else about Saudi Arabia. A reporter who consulted a Middle 
East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until 
the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a 
brochure published by the Arabian-American Oil Company. "This 
is where I get my information from", he confided. "But bring it 
right back. It's the only copy I've got".   The size of 
Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his 
first meeting with Eisenhower. When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert 
robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview. 
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-American 
friendship to bore in on the central question. How many 
children did the King have?   "Twenty-one", replied the sheik.

And how many of these were sons?   "Twenty-five", 
the sheik replied.   "Do you mean to tell us", a reporter 
asked, "that the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom 
are sons"?   The sheik smiled and murmured: "That is 
precisely correct".   The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness 
of language. When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East 
peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon found himself 
speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo, a language as anarchic 
as Casey Stengel's. The reports of President Nasser's pledges 
which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became 
increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli 
Foreign Minister, Mrs& Golda Meir. Finally he reported that 
Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli 
concessions. 
The deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the 
washing is done outside. I know now why our Japanese friends were 
surprised when they walked into our bathroom.   Of course, most 
toilets are Eastern style- at floor level- but even when they are 
raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets- inside. 
A few newer homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running 
water, they are usually Eastern style.   The next day I visited 
International Christian College which has developed since the war 
under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan 
well. They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching 
and learning. The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical 
stockroom. Spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need 
to be Christian. They have an enviable record of being able to place 
in employment 100% of their graduates.   In the afternoon Miss 
Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs& 
Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers. Mrs& 
Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about- beautiful, 
artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household- 
(four boys and four girls), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle Japanese 
woman. She was a real experience! The dances were as beautiful 
as anything I have ever seen- they rival the New York Rockettes 
for scenery and precision as well as imagination.   Because 
Don was leaving the next day, I spent the evening with him at Asia 
Center. The following morning Mr& Morikawa called for me, and 
we went to visit schools- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary 
school, and high school- Mr& Yoshimoto's school. There 
is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected- some think 
too much.   There is a great deal of thought being given to 
the question of moral education in the schools. With the loss of the 
Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God 
or moral teachings that have strength. The older parents continued 
to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people, 
who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents. There seems 
to be no purpose in life that is sure- no certain guiding principles 
to give stability. As a result, money is spent quickly and freely, 
with no thought of its value. Gambling is everywhere, especially among 
students. Parents indulge their children.   The government 
has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education 
for the schools- but the teachers often have no firm conviction 
and are confused. I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese 
soldiers would not fight again- for why should they? It will be 
painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will 
create or what strong convictions they will develop.   In the evening 
the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the 
New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good. 
They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good, 
except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like. Six of the 
science teachers were present, and we had great fun. 

#KYOTO#

After 
a day at Nikko, Mrs& Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto. 
My instructions were that Mr& Nishimo would meet me at the hotel, 
but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm 
welcome. My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan 
Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen, 
but it was fun for once to be elegant- I did explain to the students, 
however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very 
small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well. They 
understood and teased me a bit about it.   I think I would have 
been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara, 
and Hiroshima. Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its 
cultural center. It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war- 
and 
is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan. Here 
I was accompanied by Mrs& Okamoto (Fumio's mother), her son, 
Mr& Washizu (a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding 
for more than a year), and Mr& Nishima, one of the science 
teachers. I arrived at 7:00 a&m& and by 9:00 a&m& I had 
finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned. 
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens. We visited the 
Okamoto home- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony. 
At 6:00 p&m& we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place 
where these beautiful dances originated. They were even better than 
those of Tokyo- more spectacular and more imaginative.   After 
a supper of <unagi> (rice with eel- eel which is raised in an 
ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt& Fuji), I returned to my beautiful 
room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day. 
We started at 9 a&m& to visit the Kyoto University where Mr& 
Washizu is attending. I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities 
accompanying the medical school. They apologized for the condition,
