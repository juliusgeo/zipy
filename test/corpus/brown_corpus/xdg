and I sighed with relief. 'Thank God for that' I said; 
'I thought it was a human being'". #@#

In a sense, 
perhaps, Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter 
(was it Salvador Dali?) who first conceived the startling fancy of 
a picture window in the abdomen. That is, it is literally a picture 
window: you don't see into the viscera; you see a picture- trees, 
or flowers. This is something like what Thurber's best effects 
are like, if I am not mistaken.   Though no longer able to turn 
out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches (several old favorites are 
scattered through the present volume) Thurber has retained unimpaired 
his vision of humor as a thing of simple, unaffected humanness. In 
his concluding paragraph he writes: "The devoted writer of humor 
will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can". For many 
readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight.

The latest Low is a puzzler. The master's hand has lost none 
of its craft. He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions 
of political and diplomatic life in the fifties. The reader 
meets a few old friends like Blimp and the ~TUC horse, and 
becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like 
the bomb itself, and civilization in her classic robe watching the 
nuclear arms race, her hair standing straight out.   But there 
is a difference between the present volume and the early Low. There 
is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings 
show. But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were 
on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning. #@#

Anyone 
can draw his own conclusions from this difference. It might be 
argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish 
the artist with drama in a lower key. But this argument cannot be 
pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings 
of its leaders in respect to corrosion. The Communists wield 
a power unknown to Hitler. And the leading issue, that of piecemeal 
aggression, remains the same. This is drama enough.   Do we ourselves 
offer Mr& Low less of a crusade? In the thirties we would 
not face our enemy; that was a nightmarish situation and Low was 
in his element. Now we have stood up to the Communists; we are stronger 
and more self-confident- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights.

Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere? 
It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they 
do not outrage him now. He writes, "Confucius held that in times 
of stress one should take short views- only up to lunchtime".

Whatever the cause, his mood in the fifties rarely rises above 
the level of the capably sardonic. Dulles? He does not seem to have 
caught the subtleties of the man. McCarthy? The skies turn dark 
but the clouds do not loose their wrath. Suez? Low seems to have 
supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently, 
so there is no fire in his eye. #@#

Stalin's death, 
Churchill's farewell to public life, Hillary and Tensing on Everest, 
Quemoy and Matsu- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade. 
Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles. Their Eisenhower 
is insubstantial. Did Low decide to let well enough alone when 
he made his selections?   He often drew the bomb. He showed puny 
men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines. And Khrushchev turned 
out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all. 
But, but and but.   Look in this book for weak mortals and only 
on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale. Read the moderately 
brief text, not for captions, sometimes for tart epigrams, once 
in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas.

A gray fox with a patch on one eye- confidence man, city slicker, 
lebensraum specialist- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this 
third relaxed allegory from Mr& Burman's refreshing Louisiana 
animal community.   The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he 
arrives from New Orleans, accompanied by one wharf rat. But like all 
despots, as he builds his following from among the gullible, he grows 
more threatening toward those who won't follow- such solid citizens 
as Doc Raccoon; Judge Black, the vegetarian black snake; 
and the eagle, who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in 
Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces.   As soon as the fox 
has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats, who, 
of course, say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination 
campaign 
in the city. (The followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved 
about the very things 
they plan to do to others.) They train the mink 
and other animals to fight. And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that 
he won't have anyone around that's against him, and setting out 
to break his second territorial treaty with the birds.   Robert 
Hillyer, the poet, writes in his introduction to this brief animal 
fable that Mr& Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish 
Bend series. He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be 
given fewer prizes. But it's hard to imagine Mr& Burman as a Nobel 
laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous 
fables.   In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern 
dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris (Uncle Remus) and 
the polished, witty fables of James Thurber.

George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the 
West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War /2, is the 
finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years. 
It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work: Scrupulous 
scholarship, a fund of personal experience, a sense of drama and characterization 
and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues.

In short, the book, based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard 
University, is both reliable and readable; the author possesses 
an uncommonly fine English style, and he is dealing with subjects 
of vast importance that are highly topical for our time. If Mr& 
Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals, if his analysis 
of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars 
and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic- well, the 
record itself is not too encouraging.   Mr& Kennan takes careful 
account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical 
atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken. But he rejects, 
perhaps a little too sweepingly, the theory that disloyal and pro-Communist 
influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin 
which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high 
point at the Yalta Conference in February, 1945.   After all, 
Alger Hiss, subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he 
gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents, was at Yalta. 
And Harry Dexter White, implicated in F&B&I& reports 
in Communist associations, was one of the architects of the Morgenthau 
Plan, which had it ever been put into full operation, would have 
simply handed Germany to Stalin. One item in this unhappy scheme was 
to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors, 
among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength.

It is quite probable, however, that stupidity, inexperience and 
childish adherence to slogans like "unconditional surrender" had 
more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than 
treason or sympathy with Communism. Mr& Kennan sums up his judgment 
of what went wrong this way: 

#DASHED HOPE#

"You see, 
first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills, the unshakeable 
American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender: 
The tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as 
a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given 
status quo, but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and 
total evil, with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought 
to the complete destruction of the enemy's power, no matter what disadvantages 
or complications this might involve for the more distant 
future".   Recognizing that there could have been no effective 
negotiated peace with Hitler, he points out the shocking failure to 
give support to the anti-Nazi underground, which very nearly eliminated 
Hitler in 1944. A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge 
of Russian language, history and literature, Kennan recalls how, at 
the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, he penned 
a private note to a State Department official, expressing the hope 
that "never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in 
the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries".   The 
hope was vain. With justified bitterness the author speaks of "what 
seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the 
nature of the Russian Communist movement, about the history of its 
diplomacy, about what had happened in the purges, and about what had 
been going on in Poland and the Baltic States". He also speaks of 
Franklin D& Roosevelt's "puerile" assumption that "if only 
he (Stalin) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone 
like F&D&R& himself, ideological preconceptions would melt and 
Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged".

No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy 
was a wistful desire for the return of the "good old days" of Roosevelt.

This fascinating story begins with a sketch, rich in 
personal detail, of the glancing mutual impact of World War /1, and 
the two instalments of the Russian Revolution. The first of these 
involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government 
in March, 1917; the second, the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks 
(who later called themselves Communists) in November of the 
same year.   As Kennan shows, the judgment of the Allied governments 
about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession 
of defeating Germany. They were blind to the evidence that nothing 
could keep the Russian people fighting. They attributed everything 
that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue. This, 
more than any other factor, led to the fiasco of Allied intervention. 
As the author very justly says:   "Had a world war not been 
in progress, there would never, under any conceivable stretch of the 
imagination, have been an Allied intervention in North Russia". 
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated 
by Communist propaganda; here Kennan, operating with precise 
facts and figures, performs an excellent job of debunking. 

#PLEBIAN 
DICTATORS#

Of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's 
vivid style, the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators 
whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may 
be selected. On Stalin:   "This was a man of incredible criminality, 
of a criminality effectively without limits; a man apparently 
foreign to the very experience of love, without mercy or pity; 
a man in whose entourage none was ever safe; a man whose hand was set 
against all that could not be useful to him at the moment; a man who 
was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators 
in crime **h".   And here is Kennan's image of Hitler, 
Stalin's 
temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of 
weaker peoples, and his later enemy:   "Behind that Charlie 
Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered
