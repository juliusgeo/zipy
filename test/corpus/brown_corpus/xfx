pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which 
perpetuate all events.   The body, senses and brain, in common with 
all matter, have their counterpart on each of a countless number of 
frequencies. The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only 
of phenomena that share its own frequency, whereas those upon all other 
frequencies are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them. Consciousness 
is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory 
impressions. When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the 
wakeful world, it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present 
past and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one left 
when the body tired and required sleep.   If the photographically 
realistic continuity of dreams, however bizarre their combinations, 
denies that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must be compounded 
from views of diverse realities, although some of them may never 
be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.   Dr& 
H& V& Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University 
of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with 
the king Kurigalzu, (1300 B&C&) escorted him to the treasure 
chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information 
about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification. 
As a matter of fact, the incorrect classification, the result 
of many weeks of labor by Dr& Hilprecht, was about to be published 
by him the following day. Some time later the missing part of the relic 
was found and the complete inscription, together with other new evidence, 
fully corroborated the ancient priest's information. Dr& 
Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest 
in his dream. He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite, 
and imagined it must have been German or English.   We may 
conclude that all six points of information, ostensibly given by the 
dream priest, <could have> been furnished by Dr& Hilprecht's 
<subconscious> reasoning. But, in denying any physical reality for 
this dream, how could the brain possibly compose that realistic, vividly 
visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout, violent break or 
sudden substitution? Which theory is more fantastic: 1. that the 
perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions 
in the professor's brain, or 2. that the dream was a reality on the 
infinite progressions of universal, gradient frequencies, across which 
the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met?

The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines 
whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or 
the vaguely, effective source of the weird <deja vue> feeling. No 
doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the 
sleeper's mind. Probably less than one percent of our previsions 
escape final obliteration before we wake. When we arrive at the events 
concerned in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress 
us as anything familiar. Nevertheless, there are notably frequent 
instances of <deja vue,> in which our recognition of an entirely novel 
event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which, 
though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive 
corps of psychologists. If <deja vue> is an illusion, then peculiarly, 
it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most 
level-headed people.   Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for 
the Republican Presidential nomination, was attending a convention 
at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt 
for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary 
chairman was a man he had never met. After the preliminary business 
affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech 
that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt. If Depew had told any 
academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through 
that identical convention session at some time in the past, he would 
have been informed that he was a victim of <deja vue>. But the famous 
orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene. He remembered 
exactly when he had lived through it before, and he had something 
to prove he had.   One week before the convention, Depew was 
seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing at the opposite 
shore.

"THE FOOD IS WONDERFUL and it is a lot of fun to be here"!

So wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents 
from North Country School, Lake Placid, New York. In this 
one sentence, he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition 
and psychological programs in operation at the school.   Because 
the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value, care 
for its origin, and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients, 
the food <does> taste good. When served in a psychological 
atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from 
what they eat because they are free from tension, a foundation is laid 
for a high level of health that releases the children from physical 
handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments, the 
athletic programs and the most important phase, the educational opportunities.

Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain 
scenery in the country, the school buildings are located amid open 
fields 
and farm lands. These contemporary structures, beautifully adapted to 
a school in the country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen, 
grades four through eight. From fourteen states and three foreign 
countries they come to spend the months from mid-September to June.

The Director, Walter E& Clark, believes that a school 
with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility 
for their welfare. To him this means caring for the whole child, 
providing basic nutrition, and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom 
for the development of the mind. 

#IMPROVED FARMING METHODS#

The 
concept of good nutrition really began with the garden. The school has 
always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school. In a climate 
hostile to agriculture, Mr& Clark has had to keep alert to the 
most productive farm techniques.   Where a growing season may, 
with luck, allow 60 days without frost, and where the soil is poor, 
sandy, quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail. Throughout 
the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear 
ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.   Mr& Clark 
found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing, use of chemical fertilizers 
and insecticides, plus the application of conservation principles 
of rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato 
fields and depreciation of the soil.   "To give up these 
notions required a revolution in thought", Mr& Clark said in reminiscing 
about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began 
reading "Organic Gardening" and "Modern Nutrition" in a 
search for help with his problems.   "Louis Bromfield's writings 
excited me as a conservationist". By 1952 he was convinced he 
would no longer spray. He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it 
still remains. After reading "Plowman's Folly" by Edward H& 
Faulkner, he stopped plowing.   The basis for compost materials 
already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the 
riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage, a beef herd 
and wastes of all kinds. Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for 
coffee grounds and egg shells.   All these materials and supplementary 
manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry 
farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year. It was applied 
with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader. 
Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed 
the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity. Soon after 
the method changed, visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate 
his soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it was the soil treatment 
alone that accomplished this.   To demonstrate the soil 
of his vegetable gardens as it is today, Mr& Clark stooped to scoop 
up a handful of rich dark earth. Sniffing its sweet smell and letting 
it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed to the nearby 
driveway and said, "This soil used to be like that hard packed 
road over there".   "People and soils respond slowly", says 
Walter Clark, "but the time has now come when the gardens produce 
delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program. No 
chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are 
used".   The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas, 
potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the 
root cellar. The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter; 
the cabbage and squash keep until March or April. There is never 
enough corn, peas or strawberries.   Mr& Clark still has 
to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields, but he 
has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued 
use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in 
the 
future. A new project planned is the use of Bio-Dynamic Starter.

New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil 
treatment. "After the soil, the kitchen", says Mr& Clark. The 
first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of 
white bread.   "Adults take a long time to convince and you are 
thwarted if you try to push". At first the kitchen help was tolerant, 
but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves. "You 
can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread", was an early 
complaint. Of course they learned in time that they not only could use 
whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better. 

#HOMEMADE BREAD# 

Mrs& Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and cared for 
the ordering. Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be 
kitchen manager. Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and 
baked into bread. Mr& Clark's studies taught him that the only 
way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the 
flour. Once the grains are ground, vitamin ~E begins to deteriorate 
immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the 
air within one week.   A mill stands in a room off the kitchen. 
Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in 
the state. Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat, oats, and soy 
beans and turns on the motor. She goes on about her work and listens 
for the completion of the grinding. The bread baked from this mixture 
is light in color and fragrant in aroma. It is well liked by the children 
and faculty.   There is one problem with the bread. "Lillian's 
bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here 
that it is hard not to eat too much", said the secretary ruefully eyeing 
her extra pounds. 

#HOT, FRESHLY-GROUND CEREAL#

The school has 
not used cold prepared cereals for years, though at one time that was 
all they ever served. When the chance came, they first eliminated 
cold cereal once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground 
cereal every day.   They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal. 
Occasionally, the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal 
which they call "buckshot". At the beginning of the school year, 
the new students don't eat the cereal right away, but within a short 
time they are eating it voraciously.   When they leave for vacations 
they miss the hot cereal. The school has received letters from 
parents asking, "What happened to Johnny? He never used to like 
any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants. Where can we 
get this cereal he likes so much"?
