He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder 
developments where gas is available.   It would be pretty 
difficult to install a Tri-State system in old neighborhoods, and that's 
an understatement. The job of getting property easements and street 
easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging. 
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch 
the solutions are simple. 

#FUTURE PLANS#

What does Tri-State actually 
want to do, now that it has the meters under franchise and certain 
phases of its piping system in the "patent applied for" stage? 
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including 
its facility in their new home projects, by financing and installing 
the storage, piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years, 
with renewal options, to a strong oil company. It may also work in one 
other way- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters, 
letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.

This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers, 
for the idea has so often been mentioned, somewhat wistfully. 
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights. Only eight of 
the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on 
June 8th; others were building. The big tanks were at the site but 
still sunning themselves. A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches, 
and the town building inspector was paying a friendly, if curious, 
visit.   The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a revival 
of research and development. A primary ingredient in these fields 
is imagination, and Tri-State Pipeline Corporation deserves a 
very good mark.

EVERY YEAR about this time National Gargle Your Cooling 
System week rolls around. It pays in the long (hot) run to take good 
care of the water works. Do it this way for the summer gargle:

@ First, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer. Don't 
save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive "permanent" type. 
The word means it won't boil away easily, nothing else. The rust 
inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year, and you don't want 
to risk the rust that two years' use could mean. Pitch it out.

@ If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good flushing cleaner.

@ Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor. Of 
course, you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.

@ Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections, 
around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals and heater 
fittings.   @ Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat 
opens, and then look for leaks again. Be sure the bugs and 
dirt are blown out of the radiator fins. Use the air hose for this job. 
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.   If you 
use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as "Dowguard" 
be sure to check it. Dow says that the fluid can be used now 
for two years. Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in 
during the summer.   Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid 
those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms 
this summer.   {Don't let your mechanics} pull the thermostats 
out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours. 
Spring and summer may be here officially, but those thermos stay 
in.   The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from 
any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase the fuel consumption, 
reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation 
of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.   If you 
run into excess plug fouling on one truck, check to be sure that the rig 
has a thermostat. The thermostat is important to get your engine up 
to operating temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its most 
efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.

{Are you paying too much} for your truck insurance? There's 
a good chance you are doubling on some coverage, not taking discounts 
coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.

Have a talk with your insurance agent. Be careful that you keep 
adequate coverage, but look for places to save money. First go over the 
type of coverage you now have. Look for these features which may mean 
you can save:   @ Duplicate coverage. Avoid doubling up 
on the same item. For example, don't pay in a truck policy for medical 
coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.

@ Does your policy have a lay-up clause? This means that 
if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days, insurance 
can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to 
you. This applies to repair work or winter storage.   The figure 
five is important in insurance. With many company policies you get 
a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs. This means either cars 
or trucks. Discounts run up to 2% of cost.   Usually premium 
reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability 
plan. For example: If your bodily injury claims start payment after 
the first $250, a 25% premium saving is often made. 
{I}n the period since the end of World War /2,- a period 
coinciding 
with merchandising demands for the colorful, the unusual, and the original 
in signs and displays- plastics have come on so strong that 
today 
they are the acknowledged leaders in the field. The importance of the 
sign industry to the plastics industry, however, is not in terms of 
volume alone. Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing 
approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings 
of other industries. Many of today's developments in thermoforming 
stem from original work done with signs and displays; the art of 
preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers; 
and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons, 
medallions, etc&, owes much to the field, as does the technology 
of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent 
plastics.   There is much that many industries can continue to 
learn from some of the more recent developments described below. The 
concept of trans-illumination (as shown by the photo on p& 92), as just 
one example, offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems- 
no matter what industry is involved. 

#A VOLUME MARKET#

According 
to a recent <Wall Street Journal> survey, plastics units now 
account for more than 50% of all sign sales. Five years ago, they had 
only 10% of the market, with the remainder firmly entrenched in the 
stronghold of neon tubing. And it's far from the end for plastics. 
Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during 
the 1960's will be of plastic construction. Evidence of this 
trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies 
in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co&, Los Angeles, Calif&. 
Four years ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon 
signs; today, 85% is in plastics.   From the volume standpoint, 
the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive. Aggregate 
sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million. Currently, 
there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging from small firms 
with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities 
for production of metal, electrical, and plastic components. 

#WHY 
THE TREND TO PLASTICS?#

What accounts for the rapid growth 
of plastics in the sign and display field? Out of many factors which 
might be cited, five are most important: _1._ Plastics combine 
such properties as built-in color, light weight, optional transparency 
or translucency, resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication. 
_2._ Plastic signs are economical. According to one 
major producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 
25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit. Shipping cost is 
also reduced; a 3-by- 6-ft& plastic sign weighs about 120 lb&, 
compared to 275-300 lb& for neon. The weight advantage, plus greater 
durability of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth 
in shipping. The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings 
are needed. Finally, maintenance costs on plastic signs are 
much lower than on fragile neon signs. _3._ They offer exceptional 
design freedom, making it 
possible to incorporate contours and details 
which give free range to the talents of the designer. Vacuum- and pressure-formed 
sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded 
plastics. Pre-decoration, 
low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large 
and small, thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the 
industry. _4._ Plastics signs work around the clock. Internal 
illumination, protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual 
appeal at night; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command 
attention and interest. _5._ Advances in equipment and fabrication 
techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide 
choice of production techniques, ranging from injection molding for 
intricate, smaller-size, mass-production signs (generally 5000 units is 
the minimum) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited 
runs. Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field 
are expandable styrene molding and blow molding. _WHAT PLASTICS 
TO USE?_ For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its outstanding 
optical characteristics, weather resistance and formability, strongly 
dominates the picture. At present, both the familiar cast acrylic 
and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers, 
with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total. (See 
panel, p& 166, for a comparison.)   Of interest is a recent 
announcement by Du Pont's 
Polychemicals Dept& of a new methyl methacrylate 
monomer designated as Monocite ~H 100, which was developed 
specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and 
lighting industry. Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs 
only one-third as much as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather, 
and will not yellow. Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures, 
resists chipping, cracking, and crazing, according to Du Pont.

Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed 
signs, background panels, and molded or formed letters because of its 
exceptional toughness, ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties. 
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important 
factors. New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which 
the two sheets of the laminate are of different color. Thermoforming 
the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical 
way to produce a two-color sign. (see ~MPl, Mar& 1961, 
p& 
98).   For specialized types of displays, such as large three-dimensional 
units reproducing a product, package, human or animal figures, 
etc&, reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols 
are other materials frequently used.   A relative newcomer 
in 
outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film, now used as a printed overlay 
for trans-illuminated signs (see below).   For outdoor signs and 
displays, where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a 
factor, the choice of plastics is almost unlimited. Here may be found 
regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate and 
cellulose propionate, acrylic, vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene.
