humiliation before Miss Snow's cold, bespectacled wrath. He had 
the hardest pains of growing before him now, as he approached twelve. 
These would be his hardest years, she knew, and he missed his father 
desperately.   She tried to find some way to draw him out, to 
help him. Whenever she found time, she went blackberry picking with 
him, and they would come home together, mouths purple, arms and faces 
scratched, tired enough to forget grief for another day. He tended the 
new 
colts Beau had sired. He helped Kate and Juanita enlarge the flower 
garden in the side yard, where they sometimes sat in the still evenings 
watching the last fat bees working against the summer's purple dusk.

No one went much to the crossroads now except Uncle Randolph. 
They stayed in their own world on the bluff, waiting for letters 
and the peddler, bringing 
the news. Jonathan wrote grimly of the destruction 
of Harpers Ferry before they abandoned it; of their first 
engagement at Falling Waters after Old Jack's First Brigade 
had destroyed all the rolling stock of the ~B+O Railroad. The men 
were restive, he wrote, ready to take the battle to the enemy as Jackson 
wished.   The peddler came bawling his wares and told them 
of the convention in Wheeling, Which had formed a new state government 
by declaring the government at Richmond in the east illegal because 
they were traitors. Dangling his gaudy trinkets before them, he told 
of the Rebel losses in the mountains, at Cheat and Rich mountains 
both, and the Federal march on Beverly.   "Cleaned all them 
Rebs out'n the hills, they did! They won't never git over inter 
loyal western Virginia, them traitors! The Federals is making 
everybody take the oath of loyalty around these parts too", he crowed.

After he had gone, Kate asked Uncle Randolph proudly, "Would 
you take their oath"?   And the old man had given a 
sly and wicked laugh and said, "Hell, yes! I think I've taken 
it about fifty times already"! winking at Joel's look of shock.

Her mother wrote Kate of her grief at the death of Kate's 
baby and at Jonathan's decision to go with the South "And, dear 
Kate", she wrote, "poor Dr& Breckenridge's son Robert 
is now organizing a militia company to go South, to his good father's 
sorrow. Maj& Anderson of Fort Sumter is home and recruiting volunteers 
for the U&S& Army. In spite of the fact that the state 
legislature voted us neutral, John Hunt Morgan is openly flying 
the Confederate flag over his woolen factory"!   Rumor of a 
big battle spread like a grassfire up the valley. Accounts were garbled 
at the telegraph office when they sent old George down to Parkersburg 
for the news.   "All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas 
Junction and it were a <big> fight", the old man told them.

In the next few days they had cause to rejoice. It had been 
a big battle, and the Confederate forces had won. Jonathan and Ben 
were not on the lists of the dead or on that of the missing. Kate and 
Mrs& Tussle waited for letters anxiously. Joel went to the crest 
of a hill behind the house and lit an enormous victory bonfire to celebrate. 
When Kate hurried in alarm to tell him to put it out, she 
saw other dots of flames among the western Virginia hills from the few 
scattered fires of the faithful. They all prayed now that the North 
would realize that peace must come, for Virginia had defended her land 
victoriously.   The week after Manassas the sound of horses 
in the yard brought Kate up in shock from an afternoon's rest when 
she saw the Federal soldiers from her upstairs window. They had already 
lost most of their corn, she thought. Were they to be insulted again 
because of the South's great victory? She remembered McClellan's 
last proclamation as she hurried fearfully down the stairs.

At the landing she saw Juanita, her face flushed pink with excitement, 
run down the hall from the kitchen to the front door. Juanita 
stopped just inside the open door, her hand to her mouth. As Kate 
came swiftly down the stairs to the hall she saw Colonel Marsh framed 
in the doorway, his face set in the same vulnerable look Juanita wore. 
Kate greeted him gravely, uneasy with misgivings at his visit.

"What brings you here again, Colonel Marsh"? she asked, 
taking him and Juanita into the parlor where the shutters were closed 
against the afternoon sun.   "I stopped to say goodbye, Mrs& 
Lattimer, and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby. 
I wish our doctor could have saved her".   "It was a terrible 
loss to me", said Kate quietly, feeling the pain twist again 
at the mention, knowing now that Juanita must have written to him at 
Grafton. "Where will you go now that you're leaving Parkersburg"? 
she asked him, seeing Juanita's eyes grow bleak.   "As 
you know, General McClellan has been occupying Beverly. He has 
notified me that he has orders to go to Washington to take over the 
Army of the Potomac. I am to go to Washington to serve with him".

"When are you to leave"? Kate asked, watching them both 
now anxiously. Their eyes betrayed too much of their emotions, she 
thought sadly.   "Tomorrow. Would you permit Juanita to walk 
about the grounds with me for a short spell, Mrs& Lattimer"?

"Stay here in the parlor where it's cool", she said, trying 
to be calm. It would be better for Joel and Uncle Randolph and 
Mrs& Tussle not to see them.   Kate went back and reminded 
the kitchen women of the supper preparations. Then she took iced lemonade 
to Marsh's young aide where he sat in the cool of the big trees 
around the flower garden. When Marsh called to his aide and the pair 
rode off down the River Road where the gentians burned blue, Juanita 
was shaken and trying not to cry. She sought Kate out upstairs, 
her lips trembling.   "He wants me to go with him tomorrow", 
she told Kate.   "What do you want to do"? Kate asked, 
uneasy at the gravity of the girl's dilemma.   "I could go 
with him. He knows me as your niece, which, of course, I am. But I 
am a slave! You <own> me. It's your decision", said Juanita, 
holding her face very still, trying to contain the bitterness of her 
voice as she enunciated her words too distinctly.   "No, the 
decision is yours. I have held your papers of manumission since I 
married Mr& Lattimer".

The red glow from the cove had died out of the sky. The two in 
the bed knew each other as old people know the partners with whom they 
have shared the same bed for many years, and they needed to say no 
more. The things left unsaid they both felt deeply, and with a sigh they 
fell back on the well-stuffed pillows. Anita put out the remaining 
candles with a long snuffer, and in the smell of scented candlewick, 
the comforting awareness of each other's bodies, the retained pattern 
of dancers and guests remembered, their minds grew numb and then empty 
of images. They slept- Mynheer with a marvelously high-pitched 
snoring, the damn seahorse ivory teeth watching him from a bedside table.

In the ballroom below, the dark had given way to moonlight 
coming in through the bank of French windows. It was a delayed moon, 
but now the sky had cleared of scudding black and the stars sugared 
the silver-gray sky. Martha Schuyler, old, slow, careful of foot, came 
down the great staircase, dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk, 
her jeweled shoe buckles held forward.   "Well, I'm here 
at last", she said, addressing the old portraits on the walls. "I 
don't hear the music. I am getting deaf, I must admit it".

She came to the ballroom and stood on the two carpeted steps that 
led down to it. "Where is everyone? I say, where is everyone? 
Peter, you lummox, you've forgot to order the musicians". 
She stood there, a large old woman, smiling at the things she would 
say to him in the morning, this big foolish baby of a son. There were 
times now, like this, when she lost control of the time count and moved 
freely back and forth into three generations. Was it a birthday ball? 
When Peter had reached his majority at eighteen? Or was it 
her own first ball as mistress of this big house, a Van Rensselaer bride 
from way upstate near Albany, from Rensselaerwyck. And this handsome 
booby, staring and sweating, was he her bridegroom?   Martha 
picked up the hem of her gown and with eyes closed she slowly began 
to dance a stately minuet around the ballroom. ##

David Cortlandt 
was tired beyond almost the limits of his flesh. He had ridden 
hard from Boston, and he was not used to horseback. Now, driving the 
horse and sulky borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler, he felt as if every 
bone was topped by burning oil and that every muscle was ready to dissolve 
into jelly and leave his big body helpless and unable to move.

The road leading south along the river was shaded with old trees, 
and in the moonlight the silvery landscape was like a setting for trolls 
and wood gods rather than the Hudson River Valley of his boyhood 
memories. He slapped the reins on the back of the powerful gray horse 
and held on as the sulky's wheels hit a pothole and came out with 
a jolt and went on. He would cross to Manhattan, to Harlem Heights, 
before morning. There a certain farmhouse was a station for the 
Sons of Liberty. He would send on by trusted messenger the dispatches 
with their electrifying news. And he would sleep, sleep, and never 
think of roads and horses' sore haunches, of colonial wars. 
Strange how everything here fitted back into his life, even if he had 
been away so long. Mynheer, Sir Francis, the valley society, the very 
smell of the river on his right purling along to the bay past fish 
weirs and rocks, and ahead the sleepy ribbon of moon-drenched road. A 
mist was walking on the water, white as cotton, but with a blending 
and merging grace.   Ahead there was a stirring of sudden movement 
at a crossroads. David reached for the pair of pistols in the saddlebags 
at his feet. He pulled out one of them and cocked it. A strange 
wood creature came floating up from a patch of berry bushes. It was 
a grotesque hen, five or six feet tall. It had the features of a man 
bewhiskered by clumps of loose feathers. It ran, this apocalyptic beast, 
on two thin legs, and its wings- were they feathered arms?- 
flapped as it ran. Its groin was bloody. Black strips of skin hung 
from it.   The horse shied at the dreadful thing and flared its 
nostrils. David took a firm hand with it. The creature in feathers 
looked around and David saw the mad eyes, glazed with an insane fear. 
The ungainly bird thing ran away, and to David its croaking sounded 
like the crowing of a tormented rooster. Then it was gone. He drove 
on, wary and shaken. The Sons were out tonight. 

#CHAPTER 10#

New 
York lay bleaching in the summer sun, and the morning fish hawk, flying 
in the heated air, saw below him the long triangular wedge of Manhattan 
Island. It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens 
and laid out into pig-infested streets, mostly around the Battery, going 
bravely north to Wall Street, but giving up and becoming fields 
and farms in the region of Harlem Heights. From there it looked across 
at Westchester County and the Hudson River where the manor houses, 
estates, and big farms of the original (non-Indian) landowners 
began.   On the east side of the island of Manhattan the indifferent 
hawk knew the East River that connected New York Bay with Long 
Island Sound. On the western tip of Long Island protruded Brooklyn 
Heights. It commanded a view over Manhattan and the harbor. 
A fringe of housing and gardens bearded the top of the heights, and 
behind it were sandy roads leading past farms and hayfields. Husbandry 
was bounded by snake-rail fences, and there were grazing cattle. On 
the shores north and south, the fishers and mooncursers- smugglers- 
lived along the churning Great South Bay and the narrow barrier 
of sand, Fire Island.   The morning hawk, hungry for any eatable,
