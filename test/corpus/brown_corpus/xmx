that a government dominated by either party could fairly administer 
elections. The P&D&I& and later the Popular Movement protected 
the Istiqlal's "privileged position" until the fall of 
Balafrej, and then the Istiqlal used the same argument, which it had 
previously ignored, against the pro-U&N&F&P& tendencies 
of the Ibrahim government.   The bulk of the preparation had, 
of course, proceeded under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior, 
whose officials are barred from party activity and probably generally 
disinterested in party politics. Apart from some areas of recurring 
trouble, like Bani Mellal, where inexperienced officials had 
been appointed, there is little evidence that local officials intervened 
in the electoral process. Centrally, however, the administrative 
problem was more complex and the sheer prestige of office was very likely 
an unfair advantage. The King decided to remove Ibrahim a week 
before elections and to institute a non-party Council of Government 
under his personal direction. Although the monarch had frequently asserted 
that the elections were to be without party significance, his action 
was an implicit admission that party identifications were a factor. 
The new Council was itself inescapably of political meaning, which 
was most clearly revealed in the absence of any U&N&F&P& 
members and the presence of several Istiqlal leaders. Since the 
details of the elections were settled the change of government had no 
direct effect on the technical aspects of the elections, and may have 
been 
more important as an indication of royal displeasure with the U&N&F&P&

Voting preparations began in the fall of 1959, 
although the actual demarcation and planning for the rural communes 
was completed in 1958. There were three major administrative tasks: 
the fixing of electoral districts, the registration of voters and the 
registration of candidates. Voter registration began in late November 
1959 and continued until early January, 1960. The government was 
most anxious that there be a respectable response. Periodic bulletins 
of the accomplishment in each province made the registration process 
into a kind of competition among provincial officials. A goal was fixed, 
as given in Table 2, and attention focused on its fulfillment. The 
qualifications to vote were kept very simple. Both men and women of 
twenty-one years of age could register and vote upon presenting proof 
of residence and identification. There were liberal provisions for 
dispensation where documents or records were lacking. The police were 
disqualified along with certain categories of naturalized citizens, criminals 
and those punished for Protectorate activities.   The 
registration figures given in Table 2 must be interpreted with caution 
since the estimate for eligible electors were made without the benefit 
of a reliable census.

Unemployed older workers who have no expectation of securing employment 
in the occupation in which they are skilled should be able to 
secure counseling and retraining in an occupation with a future. Some 
vocational training schools provide such training, but the current 
need exceeds the facilities. _CURRENT PROGRAMS_ The present Federal 
program of vocational education began in 1917 with the passage of 
the Smith-Hughes Act, which provided a continuing annual appropriation 
of $7 million to support, on a matching basis, state-administered 
programs of vocational education in agriculture, trades, industrial skills 
and home economics. Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related 
acts have extended this Federal program. The George-Barden 
Act of 1946 raised the previous increases in annual authorizations to 
$29 million in addition to the $7 million under the Smith Act. The 
Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $5 million for practical nurse 
training.   The latest major change in this program was introduced 
by the National Defense Education Act of 1958, Title /8, of 
which amended the George-Barden Act. Annual authorizations of $15 
million were added for area vocational education programs that meet national 
defense needs for highly skilled technicians.   The Federal 
program of vocational education merely provides financial aid to encourage 
the establishment of vocational education programs in public 
schools. The initiative, administration and control remain primarily 
with the local school districts. Even the states remain primarily in 
an assisting role, providing leadership and teacher training.   Federal 
assistance is limited to half of the total expenditure, and the 
state or local districts must pay at least half. The state may decide 
to encourage local programs by paying half of the cost, or the state 
may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it. 
Throughout the history of the program, state government expenditures 
in the aggregate have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures, 
while local districts all together have spent more than either 
Federal or state governments. Today, Federal funds account for only 
one-fifth of the nation's expenditures for vocational education. The 
greatest impact of the matching-fund principle has been in initially 
encouraging the poorest states and school districts to spend enough 
to obtain their full allocation of outside funds.   National defense 
considerations have been the major reason behind most Federal 
training expenditures in recent decades. During World War /2, about 
7.5 million persons were enrolled in courses organized under two special 
programs administered by state and local school authorities: (1) 
Vocational Education for National Defense, and (2) War Production 
Training. The total cost of the five-year program was $297 million. 
For the Smith-Hughes, George-Barden, and National Defense 
Act of 1958, the cumulative total of Federal expenditures in 42 years 
was only about $740 million.   No comparable measures are available 
of enrollments and expenditures for private vocational education 
training. There are a great number and variety of private commercial 
schools, trade schools and technical schools. In addition, many large 
corporations operate their own formal training programs. A recent study 
indicated that 85 per cent of the nation's largest corporations 
conducted educational programs involving some class meetings and examinations.

Most skilled industrial workers, nevertheless, still 
acquire their skills outside of formal training institutions. The National 
Manpower Council of Columbia University has estimated that 
three out of five skilled workers and one out of five technicians have 
not been formally trained.   There is little doubt that the students 
benefit from vocational education. Employers prefer to hire youth 
with such training rather than those without, and most graduates of 
vocational training go to work in jobs related to their training. Vocational 
educators do not claim that school training alone makes skilled 
workers, but it provides the essential groundwork for developing skills.

In most states, trade and industrial training is provided 
in a minority of the high schools, usually located in the larger cities. 
In Arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high schools offer trade 
and industrial courses. In Illinois about 13 per cent of the schools 
have programs, and in Pennsylvania 11 per cent.   An important 
recent trend is the development of area vocational schools. For 
a number of years Kentucky, Louisiana and several other states have 
been building state-sponsored vocational education schools that serve 
nearby school districts in several counties. These schools are intended 
to provide the facilities and specialized curriculum that would not 
be possible for very small school districts. Transportation may be 
provided from nearby school districts. Courses are provided mainly for 
post high school day programs; but sometimes arrangements also are 
made for high school students to attend, and evening extension courses 
also may be conducted.   The Title /8, program of the National 
Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur to this trend toward 
area schools. By 1960 there were such schools in all but 4 states. 
They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas of chronic labor 
surplus and in 10 of the minor areas. An extension of this program into 
the other distressed areas should be undertaken. _RELATION TO NEW 
INDUSTRY_ Some of this trend toward area vocational schools has been 
related to the problems of persistent labor surplus areas and their 
desire to attract new industry.   The major training need of a new 
industrial plant is a short period of pre-employment training for a 
large number of semi-skilled machine operators. A few key skilled workers 
experienced in the company's type of work usually must be brought 
in with the plant manager, or hired away from a similar plant elsewhere. 
A prospective industry also may be interested in the long-run 
advantages of training programs in the area to supply future skilled workers 
and provide supplementary extension courses for its employees.

The existence of a public school vocational training program in 
trade and industry provides a base from which such needs can be filled. 
Additional courses can readily be added and special cooperative programs 
worked out with any new industry if the basic facilities, staff 
and program are in being. Thus, besides the training provided to youth 
in school, the existence of the school program can have supplementary 
benefits to industry which make it an asset to industrial development 
efforts.   Few states make effective use of their existing vocational 
education programs or funds for the purpose of attracting new 
industry. The opportunity exists for states to reserve some of their 
vocational education funds to apply on an <ad hoc> flexible basis 
to subsidize any local preemployment training programs that my be quickly 
set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant. _LOCAL FOCUS 
OF PROGRAMS_ The major weakness of vocational training programs in 
labor surplus areas is their focus on serving solely local job demands. 
This weakness is not unique to labor surplus areas, for it is inherent 
in the system of local school districts in this country. 
Planning of vocational education programs and courses is oriented to 
local employer needs for trained workers. All the manuals for setting 
up vocational courses stress the importance of first making a <local> 
survey of skill needs, of estimating the growth of <local> jobs, 
and of consulting with <local> employers on the types of courses and 
their content.   Furthermore, there is a cautious conservatism 
on the part of those making local skill surveys. Local jobs can be seen 
and counted, while opportunities elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical.

While the U& S& Department of Labor has a 
program of projecting industry and occupational employment trends and 
publishing current outlook statements, there is little tangible evidence 
that these projections have been used extensively in local curriculum 
planning. The U& S& Office of Education continues to stress 
local surveys rather than national surveys.   This procedure is 
extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus areas with a long history 
of declining employment. Elaborate studies have been made in labor 
surplus areas in order to identify sufficient numbers of local job 
vacancies and future replacement needs for certain skills to justify 
training programs for those skills. No effort is made in the same studies 
to present information on regional or national demand trends in these 
skills or to consider whether regional or national demands for other 
skills might provide much better opportunities for the youth to be 
trained.   Moreover, the current information on what types of training 
are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary. There 
simply is not enough material available on the types of job skills that 
are in demand and the types of training programs that are required 
or most suitable. Much of the available information comes not from the 
Federal government but from an exchange of experiences among states. 
_PROPOSALS_ State and local agencies in the vocational education 
field must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook on future job opportunities. 
There is a need for an expanded Federal effort to provide 
research and information to help guide state education departments and 
local school boards in existing programs.   A related question 
is whether unemployed workers can be motivated to take the training provided. 
There is little evidence that existing public or private training 
programs have any great difficulty getting students to enroll in 
their programs, even though they must pay tuition, receive no subsistence 
payments, and are not guaranteed a job. However, there always is 
some limit to the numbers who will spend the time and effort to acquire 
training. Again, one major difficulty is the local focus.   A 
training program in a depressed area may have few enrollees unless there 
is some apparent prospect for better employment opportunities afterwards,
