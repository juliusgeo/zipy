double shotgun, and its trigger pull is light and sharp. The 240-grain 
bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 ~fps, which gives it all the smash 
needed at woods ranges. With five shots at the immediate command 
of the hunter's trigger finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.

The second really new development this year was a revolver 
handling a different sort of varmint load- the .22 Remington Jet 
Magnum Center Fire. At present it's available in one model, the 
fine and familiar Smith + Wesson Magnum revolver (about $110), 
long a top-quality handgun among target arms. The velocity of this .22-caliber, 
40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 ~fps, and it's 
the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range 
rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range. This is a varmint load, 
pure and simple; it's much too explosive for small edible game. 
It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry 
of feathers.   The most intriguing aspect of the ~S+W Magnum 
chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard .22 rim-fires 
by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers. You may therefore 
convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm, although the difference 
in the point of impact (Jet vs& rim-fire) can be somewhat disconcerting. 
The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine; I tested 
it in my scoped ~S+W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a 
chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun 
steadily. 

#HUNTING RIFLES, '61#

The fact that the Deerstalker 
and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't 
mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers. 
Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of hunting rifles have been 
introduced for the first time. Here are the brands (in alphabetical 
order) and the new models.   Newcomers to the American hunter 
are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles. They have 
fine ~FN actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal 
and the stock wood. Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various 
calibers available, and these include the standard bores (about $165) 
plus the Magnums (around $170); the latter include the .264, .300 
~H+H, .338, .375 and .458. Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard 
on all of the Magnums except the .264. Stock designs are excellent 
for use with scopes.   Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are 
all made with Sako actions, regardless of caliber. The .222's have 
the short action; the .243 and .308, the medium action, and the .270, 
**f and the Magnums, the long action (about $135 for the Standard 
Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version). Previously, ~FN actions 
were used for the larger cartridges.   High standard has 
introduced a .22 auto, the Sport-King, in two grades- field and special 
(less than $45 and just over $45, respectively). It's a streamlined 
rifle, fast and well-made.   Among .22 Magnum Rim-Fire 
rifles, 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader 
(around $60). Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given 
this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the 
260 is the first autoloader to handle .22 Magnum rim-fires.

Marlin 
has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings. The 
Model 99 (under $45) is a light-weight, streamlined .22 rim-fire auto 
with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles. It's extremely 
accurate for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely 
trouble-free in functioning. The 989 (about $40) is an even newer .22 
auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.   Once again the 
Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared, but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun 
combination. The bore is unrifled but is provided with an 
insert tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives pretty fair 
accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long. You can unscrew 
this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with .22 shotshells- 
to break the little Targo clay targets. A trap for throwing 
these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can 
throw his own targets. A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular 
hand trap are also available. You can have your choice of a seven-shot 
repeater, the ~340TR (about $40) or a single-shot, the ~320TR 
($10 less).   The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting 
or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks 
to run up a score on the clay birds. They'll travel 50 feet or 
more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to 
break one after it passes the 35-foot mark. The combination of thin 
pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds, 
right now!   Big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line 
for 1961, with the addition of the .375 and .458 to the list of Model 
725's. These are made on special order only, in Kodiak grade 
(about $310), with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads; 
they weigh around nine pounds.   A shortened version of the 
highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961. This 
carbine (under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade) has an 18-1/2-inch 
barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's 
Model 760 pump with a short-barrel. This design is hard to beat 
for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard. Presently, 
the ~742C is available in **f.   The latest versions of the famous 
Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight (about $125) and the 
99 Deluxe (under $135), which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger 
design. The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will 
make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new 
safety is easier and faster to operate. 

#BEGINNERS' GUNS, '61# 

A fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're 
good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to 
get for a youngster. The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 (about 
$20, $5 for a saddle scabbard)- a lever-action single-shot patterned 
after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western 
look. Because of its traditional lines, it probably has more kid 
appeal than any other model. The action is a drop-block, handling all 
the standard .22 rim-fires.   Marlin's latest is also designed 
for the beginning shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty 
of barrel weight and ample stock. This is the Model 122 (about 
$20); it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety- 
i&e&, the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun 
cocked for the next shot. Stock design is excellent, and this model 
is a good first gun. Another boy's model is the .22 single-shot Remington 
~514C (around $20), which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a 
short- 12-1/2-inch- stock; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.

A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year. 
The single-barrel Stevens ~940Y (under $35) is made with a side lever 
rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong 
enough to operate a top tang to open a gun- and the side lever does 
indeed open very easily. This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is 
available in either 20 or .410 gauge. There's another addition to 
the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in .410 (under $75), which 
you may or may not consider a kid's gun; many experienced hunters 
like this gauge and type of scattergun too. 

#SHOTGUNS, '61#

Although 
there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year, 
a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit 
the market. For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed 
over/under, the Broadway (from $350 up, depending on grade), differs 
from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore 
end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast 
sighting.   The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the Standard 
or Custom Pump Model (about $90 and $150, respectively) in 
12, 16 and 20.   Firearms International has introduced another 
import, this one from Finland. It's the Valmet (about $170), a 12-gauge 
over/under very much like the old Remington 32- which was 
so fine 
a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.   High 
Standard has also added two models to its line. The Supermatic Trophy 
(prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional 
features) is a 12-gauge auto. The Flite-King Trophy (beginning at 
just over $85) is a pump gun in 12 or 16. Either model is a very good 
dollar value.   Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is 
the Model 500 (from $73.50); this is an improved version of the old 
Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun. See page 24 for a complete 
report on it. 

#HANDGUNS, '61#

Aside from the .22 Jet- which 
I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two 
biggest developments- few significant innovations appeared among 
1961's handguns.

LIVERY STABLE- J& VERNON, PROP"& Coaching had declined 
considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there, near the old 
Wells Fargo building in San Francisco, creaking in the fog as it 
had for thirty years. John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared 
for- he had prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom. Coaching 
was in his blood. He had two interests in life: the pleasures 
of the table and driving. Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the 
Santa Cruz road, upland and through the redwood forest, with orchards 
below him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the other. The 
journey back he made along the coast road, traveling hell-for-leather, 
every lantern of the tallyho ablaze.   The southward route 
was the classic run in California, and the most fashionable. His patronage 
on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans- regulars, 
most of them, and trenchermen like himself. They did not complain 
at the inhuman hour of starting (seven in the morning), nor of the 
tariff, which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco. 
Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in the 
mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa 
Cruz.   Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring, so 
halts were contrived between meals. Then the Chinese hostler, who rode 
with Vernon on the box, would break open a hamper and produce filets 
of smoked bass or sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree 
to be heated over a spirit lamp.   In spring and in autumn 
the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend 
of mine. They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and bits of 
resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which exists only on a forty-five 
mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains. In the Spanish 
days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense. 
It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar. 
Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips, but he could 
arrange no schedule with the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped 
off, and the botanists began to motor out by themselves. 
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular 
tallyho run. This was an honor, like dining with a captain at his private 
table. Vernon's office adjoined the stable, and the walls were 
adorned with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of the period. 
They advertised harness polish, liniments, Ball's Rubber Boots, 
Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla, patent medicines, 
shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.   The hostler would have the 
table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove; then a porter 
from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head. 
It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster 
salt roast and a mound of corn fritters. Vernon was consummately fond 
of oysters, and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil 
War. Oyster salt roast- oysters on the half shell, cooked on a bed
