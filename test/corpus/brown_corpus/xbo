or professional achievement.   In the above mentioned report of 
the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University 
Professors, the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges 
very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see 
it: "Even with the best of intentions he (the President of the 
university) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to 
a group the membership of which, considered (as it must be by him) in 
individual terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying 
temperament, interests and capabilities. It is natural that he should 
turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization 
which actually owns the university and whose goals are, in 
their opinion, identified with its highest good and (to use that oft-repeated 
phrase) 'the attainment of excellence'".   The pattern 
here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame: it is simply 
that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution 
by "the organization which actually owns" it, becomes more obvious 
where there is a larger and more distinguished "outside" faculty. 
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report 
should refer to "the organization which actually owns the university": 
this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more 
to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension. But 
in any case, one does not have to read very closely between the lines 
to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy 
one. "Outside" faculty members want to be considered partners in 
the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.

There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with 
this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university. 
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber 
personnel. Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession, 
much given to attending meetings and conferences. Expressions 
of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member 
has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype. In 
the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or 
a boycott: all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines 
to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions 
at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.

To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should be realized 
that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security, 
that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does 
in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service. Much has 
been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee 
firm tenure. This is a significant advance but its import should not 
be exaggerated. When a man invests a block of his years at a university 
without gaining the coveted promotion, not only is he faced with the 
problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in 
the market value of his services. A man does not make that kind of 
gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure 
positions is being reserved for members of the "family". ##

JUST 
AS IT is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new 
tenure practices, it is also possible to exaggerate the significance 
of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions. 
Adequate compensation is indispensable. Yet adequate compensation- 
and particularly <merely> adequate compensation is no substitute 
for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his 
earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place. Broadly 
speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible 
but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature 
responsibility in the total work of the university. Religious who 
derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious 
community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate 
both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this 
identification.   There is no need here to spell out the conditions 
of creative teaching except to point out that, at the college 
level, the sense of community and of community responsibility is even 
more necessary than it is at other levels. The college teacher needs 
the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also 
needs to feel that such communication, even informal debates over the 
luncheon table, are a contribution to the total good of the institution. 
But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from 
the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.

The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy 
between faculty members who are part of the "in-group" that owns and 
operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees, is, 
therefore, the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself. 
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary 
and tenure. Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive 
resolution of the problem of ownership and control, there are nevertheless 
certain suggestions which seem to be in order.   The first 
is a negative warning: there is no point in the creation of faculty 
committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real 
authority. In the case of academic personnel the "feeling" of 
participation can hardly be "faked". Competent teachers are well 
versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without 
destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own 
decisions. Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar 
with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to 
be taken in by "busy-work" and <ersatz> decision making. 
In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of 
participation are what is called for at all. In the Notre Dame report, 
reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced 
to "luncheon-table communication". In itself there is nothing wrong 
with this form of "participation": the only difficulty on the 
Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position 
to implement policy, i&e&, members of the religious community which 
owns and administers the institution, have their own eating arrangements. 
SEN& JOHN L& McCLELLAN of Arkansas and Rep& David 
Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions 
under the anti-monopoly laws. Once more the fallacious equation is advanced 
to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly 
laws, there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions: 
the law must treat everybody equally. Or, in the words of Anatole 
France, "The law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich, 
as well as the poor, from begging in the streets and sleeping under 
bridges".   The public atmosphere that has been generated which 
makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute 
into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr& McClellan's 
hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and, later, 
into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations 
at the missile sites. The Senator was shocked by stoppages over 
allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program. In addition, 
disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess 
of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation 
on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill. 
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages, but 
he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes 
to fight a strike. <Business Week> (Aug& 9, 1961) reports that 
the United Aircraft Company, against which the International Association 
of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep its plants 
operating. The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable 
to four factors: advertising to attract new employees, hiring 
and training them, extra overtime, and defective work performed by 
the new workers. The company has billed the United States Government 
for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation 
allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and 
necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business.   Rep& 
Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the 
attention of the Armed Services Committee. The committee remains unresponsive. 
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator McClellan 
been heard from on the matter; they are preoccupied with ending labor 
abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions. ##

THE 
RECENT publicity attending the successful federal prosecution 
of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers 
has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified 
neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained. The 
anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete, but along completely 
undefined lines; it must play a game in which there never is 
a winner. The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully 
cannot follow the law. Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a 
foolish public policy.   Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods 
industry in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number of 
other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy 
to rig prices and allocate the market. The industry is so structured 
that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way 
overhead charges are allocated- whether marginal or average pricing 
is applied.   The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise 
is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods 
in addition to the heavy electrical equipment. Accounting procedures 
can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price. Naturally, 
enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to 
structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors 
can be forced to the wall in a very short time. Should these giants 
really flex their competitive muscles, they would become the only 
survivors in the industry. Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating 
a monopoly by "unfair competition". But if they show self-restraint, 
they don't get the orders.   Under the circumstances, 
the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage 
in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter 
were convicted. Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy 
by the giants. The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by 
the demand of the government, after the conviction, that General Electric 
sign a wide-open consent decree that <it would not reduce prices 
so low as to compete seriously with its fellows>. In other words, 
the anti-trust laws, designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer 
on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. And which theory would 
govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday? ##

THE QUESTION 
might be asked: "Don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods 
manufacturers know these facts? Why did they engage in a 
flood of <mea culpas>, throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise 
to be good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence in 
the laws"?   The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to 
management was explained by Thurman Arnold, in <The Folklore of Capitalism>, 
back in 1937. He wrote: "(P& 211) **h the anti-trust 
laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need 
of great organizations, and at the same time had to deny them a place 
in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure. (P& 214) 
**h anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled 
business dictatorship. (P& 215) **h when corporate abuses were attacked, 
it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked 
rather than control. **h In this manner, every scheme for direct 
control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust 
laws. (Pp& 228-229) **h in any event, it is obvious that the anti-trust 
laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial 
empires the world has ever known, held together by some of the most 
fantastic ideas, all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation 
is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control 
by the government".   This escape from control has led to management's 
evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as 
worth while. A plea of <nolo contendere>, followed by a nominal fine, 
after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license. (The 
penalties handed out in the electrical case, which included jail
