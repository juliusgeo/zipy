have to pay- from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present 
law to as little as 192 million dollars.   Congressman Wilbur D& 
Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, asked 
the department of justice for its views on these legislative proposals 
as they related to anti-trust law enforcement. The attorney general 
responded by letter dated July 19. Copies of this letter were made 
avaliable to the press and public.   In this letter, Mr& Kennedy 
made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration- 
what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust 
judgments. There are a number of other considerations besides 
this one but it is for the Congress, not the department of justice, 
to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.

Yet your editorial said: "Now the attorney general 
writes that no considerations 'justify any loss of revenue of this 
proportion'". What Mr& Kennedy, in fact, wrote was: "It 
is the department's view that no <anti-trust enforcement> considerations 
justify any loss of revenue of this proportion".   The 
editorial, by omitting the words <anti-trust enforcement>, totally 
distorted Mr& Kennedy's views. The headline is offensive, particularly 
in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial. @ 

#CONGRESSWOMAN 
CHURCH#


_WILMETTE, AUG& 7_- I concur most heartily 
with today's letter on the futility of writing to Sen& Dirksen 
and Sen& Douglas.   But when you write to Congresswoman 
Church, bless her heart, your letter is answered fully and completely. 
Should she disagree, she explains why in detail. When she agrees, 
you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged.   I think 
we have the hardest working, best representative in Congress. 

#HARMFUL 
DRINKS#


_DOWNERS GROVE, AUG& 8_- A recent news story 
reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane 
passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks.

They do our country great harm by such actions. Those in the public 
eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad.

The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra 
and Martin to guzzle. @ 

#TOWARD SOCIALISM#


_PROVIDENCE, 
AUG& 5_- Overt socialism means government ownership and management 
of a nation's main industries. In covert socialism- toward 
which America is moving- private enterprise retains the ownership 
title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive 
regulations actually controls them.   In order to attract 
new industries, 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build 
government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise. This 
is a step toward overt socialism.   Issuing bonds for plant construction 
has brought new industries to certain regions. 
#"WORKERS OF THE PARTY"#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- We are 
writing in reference to a recent "suggestion" made to the staff 
of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City (registered 
professional nurses with college background and varying experiences). 
The day before Election Day, to which we are entitled as a legal holiday, 
we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as "workers 
of the party".   Being ethical and professional people 
interested in community health and well-being, we felt this wasn't 
a function of our position. Such tactics reek of totalitarianism! 
As we understand, this directive was given to all city and county employes.

To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed 
because of political affiliation. We, therefore, considered the "suggestion" 
an insult to our intelligence, ethics, Bill of Rights, 
etc&. Our only obligation for this day is to vote, free of persuasion, 
for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.

This is our duty- not as nurses or city employes- but as citizens 
of the United States. @ #"PLUS-ONE" SHELTERS#


_TO THE 
EDITOR:_ Sir- I read of a man who felt he should not build 
a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to 
sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters. Does this man live in 
a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves, 
but ready to demand that "the community" help and protect them?

Community shelters are, of course, necessary for those 
having 
no space for shelter. If in a town of 2,000 private homes, half of 
them have shelters, the need for the community shelters will be reduced 
to that extent.   In designing his home fallout shelter there 
is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants, 
"plus-one"- so he will be able to take in a stranger. I 
hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes 
will have a change of heart, will get busy and be the first member of 
our "plus-one" shelter club. @ 

#ESCAPE#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ 
Sir- People continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer 
space. It's simple enough from my point of view. I am for it.

It is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's 
world. @ 

#SUPPORTS KATANGA#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- When 
the colonies decided upon freedom from England, we insisted, through 
the Declaration of Independence, that the nations of the world recognize 
us as a separate political entity. It is high time the United 
States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set forth 
in that document are applicable today to Katanga.   In the United 
Nations Charter, the right of self-determination is also an essential 
principle. This, again, applies to Katanga. The people of Katanga 
had fought for, and obtained, their freedom from the Communist 
yoke of Antoine Gizenga, and his cohorts. By political, economic, geographic 
and natural standards, they were justified in doing so.

The United States and the U&N& denounce their own principles 
when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge 
the right of self-determination of the Katangans. @ 

#COUNTY 
COLLEGE COSTS#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Permit me to commend 
your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county 
colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers 
have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit 
them to.   The bill which passed the Assembly last May and 
is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny. The procedure 
for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges 
and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.

Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county 
college will be appointed; none will be elected. The trustees 
will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board 
of school estimate. This board will consist of two of the trustees 
of the college, and the director and two members of the board of freeholders. 
It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college 
and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders, which "shall 
appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made 
by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed, levied 
and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes".

The approval of only three members of the board of 
school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted 
to the college. Since two of these could be trustees of the college, 
actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected 
official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue. 
This is taxation without representation. @ 

#TAXING IMPROVEMENTS#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Your editorial, 
"Housing Speedup", is certainly not the answer to our slum problems. 
The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary 
case of slum conditions.   Change our taxing law so that no tax 
shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties. 
Then see what a boom in all trades, as well as slum clearance 
at no cost to taxpayers, will happen. Our entire economy will have 
a terrific uplift. @ #"NATURAL CAUSES"#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ 
Sir- An old man is kicked to death by muggers. The medical examiner 
states that death was due to "natural causes".   I once 
heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New York, 
it is listed as "death due to natural causes". @ 

#PRAISES 
EXHIBIT#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- Every resident of this city 
should visit the Newark Museum and see the exhibit "Our Changing 
Skyline in Newark". It will be at the museum until March 30.

It is a revelation of what has been done, what is being done 
and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects' plans, models 
and pictures. It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and 
certainly make every Newarker proud of this city.   It should 
also make him desire to participate actively in civic, school and religious 
life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live 
up to the challenge presented by this exhibit. @
