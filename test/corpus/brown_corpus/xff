proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic 
order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world. 
Here, Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism- 
producing music for the masses.   It is at this point in his life 
that the mature Prokofieff emerges. One might have expected that 
such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative 
flair of a composer, especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.

But no: Prokofieff grew. He accepted the environment 
of his destiny- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his 
early promise. By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his 
people: "I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom, but at 
the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the 
accepted methods of harmony and melody. This is precisely what makes 
lucid, straightforward music so difficult to compose- the clarity must 
be new, not old". How right he was; how clearly he saw the cultural 
defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not 
or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism. And 
with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words- with 
torrents of powerful music. Compare the vast difference in scope and 
beauty between his neat and witty little <Classical> Symphony and 
his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth Symphony; or the 
<Love for Three Oranges> (gay as it is) with the wonderful, imaginative, 
colorful, and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet, 
<The Stone Flower>. This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is 
the gaiety of dancing people: earthy, salty and humorous.   Of 
course, these works are not comparable, even though the same brain conceived 
them. The early works were conceived for a sophisticated, international 
audience; the later works were conceived to affirm a way 
of life for fellow citizens. However, in all of Prokofieff's music, 
young or mature, we find his profile- his "signature"- his 
craftsman's attitude. Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the 
cause of experimentation <per se>. In orchestration, he stretches 
the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination 
for color. His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable. 
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and 
love songs is captivating: witty, clever, adroit, and subtle. His 
counterpoint is pertinent, skillful, and rarely thick.   Also, 
it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic 
modulations, the brilliant orchestrations, the adroitness for evading 
the heaviness of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint 
were not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular historical 
dramas of the stage and cinema, where a large, dramatic canvas of sound 
was required. That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes 
seem professionally routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that 
he was less of an "original" than we prefer to believe. Need for 
novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability. 
Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero, who, by the force of 
his creative life, helped preserve the main stream of tradition, to which 
the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually 
added and integrated.   At this date, it seems probable that the 
name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History, 
as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware of the lure and danger 
of experimentation, and used it as it served his purpose; yet 
was never caught up in it- never a slave to its academic dialectics. 
Certainly, it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared 
him to the Western World- not his experimentations.   So 
Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a 
rich reward from them. Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would 
have done better, or even as well, under different circumstances. 
His fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not. Why did 
Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while Stravinsky (who leaped 
into fame like a young giant) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness? 
I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words: 
"the clarity must be new, not old". When Prokofieff forged his 
new clarity of "lucid, straightforward music, so difficult to compose", 
he shaped his talents to his purpose.   When Stravinsky 
shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons, 
many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself 
into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures. 
Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own 
people- by the compass of their national ideas. But Stravinsky 
was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting. In 
all his miscalculations, Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder 
of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations- 
representing many peoples, time periods and styles- into his own 
music by warping the harmony, melody, or form, to verify his own experiments. 
Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic 
materials, and his flair for orchestrations- his brilliant <Petruchka,> 
his savage <Sacre du Printemps,> his incisive <Les Noces>- 
the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical 
direction for which his native talents were predisposed.   But 
time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear 
that he will never find <terra firma>. His various aesthetic postulates 
remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself: Supra-Expressionism, 
Neo-Paganism, Neo-Classicism, Neo-Romanticism, 
Neo-Jazz, Neo-Ecclesiasticism, Neo-Popularism, and most recently, 
Post-Serialism- all competing with each other within one composer! 
What a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations! Meager 
and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty 
protagonist; 
a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem (<The 
Star-Spangled Banner>); a poor attempt to write an idiomatic 
jazz concerto; a circus polka for elephants; his hopes that the tunes 
from his old music might be used for popular American commercial 
songs! Stravinsky, nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic 
bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another, searching for 
a home.   How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded. Prokofieff 
was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing 
world without losing his particular force and direction. In the process, 
his native endowments were stretched, strengthened and disciplined 
to serve their human purpose.   With a large and circumspect 
20th-Century technique, he wove the materials of national heroes and 
events, national folklore and children's fairy tales- Slavic dances 
and love songs- into a solid musical literature which served his 
people well, and is providing much enjoyment to the World at large.

Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical 
feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind 
him; time and economic security; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet 
companies; choruses, chamber music ensembles; soloists; recordings; 
broadcastings; television; large and eager audiences. It 
must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many 
of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive: economic 
security and cultural opportunities, incisive idioms, social fermentations 
for a new national ideology- a sympathetic public and a large 
body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.   Thus 
in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced 
one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century. That his moods, 
even in his early years, are those of his people, does him honor, 
as his music honors those who inspired it. That he mastered every aspect 
of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary 
judgments, is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous 
pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture; 
and perhaps of even greater significance- his music is strong 20th-Century 
evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution, based on a broad 
Traditionalism for the creative art of music.

April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history- 
indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States. 
On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund, organized to furnish 
employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the 
depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes 
in the stock market crash, observed its 30th anniversary. 
ROY MASON IS ESSENTIALLY A LANDSCAPE PAINTER whose style and direction 
has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth 
century, especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell 
Cotman. And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects 
in large, simplified masses which, though they seem effortless, are 
in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough 
distillation of the natural form that inspired them.   As a 
boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the 
out-of-doors, its tang of weather, its change of seasons, its variable 
moods. His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape 
painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted 
to them his knowledge and love of nature. Out of this background of 
hunting and fishing, it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects 
he knew best: hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream, ducks 
and geese on the wing- almost always against a vast backdrop of 
weather landscape. It is this subject matter that has brought Mason 
a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional 
performance with this motif that commends him to artists and 
discerning collectors.   Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting 
himself exclusively to painting. Like many others, he had to work 
hard, long hours in a struggling family business which, though it was 
allied to art of a kind- the design and production of engraved seals- 
bore no relation to the painting of pictures. But it did teach 
Roy the basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for twelve years, 
he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia. 
On the death of their father, they returned to their home 
in Batavia, New York. After more years of concentrated effort, Roy 
and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business 
at the old stand.   During all this time Roy continued to paint, 
first only on weekends, and then, as the family business permitted, 
for longer periods. Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether, 
and for the past thirty years, he has worked independently as a painter, 
except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions. But even 
on these, the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off!

Except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey Ryder 
who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had- and 
this was limited to a few lessons, though the two artists often went on 
painting trips together- Roy developed his art by himself. In the 
best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then to draw with accuracy 
and assurance, and then to paint. He worked in oil for years before 
beginning his work in watercolor, and his first public recognition 
and early honors, including his election to the Academy, were for 
his essays in the heavier medium. Gradually watercolor claimed his greater 
affection until today it has become his major, if not exclusive, 
technique.   It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason 
on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia. More often 
than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at 
a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature 
into a composed, not imitative, painting. What I have observed 
time and time again is a process of integration, integration that begins 
as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form; color 
patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition; 
and that over-all, amazing control of large washes which is the Mason 
stylemark. Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the 
job is done. Inspiring- yes; instructive- maybe; duplicable- 
no!   But for the technical fact, we have the artist's 
own testimony:   "Of late years, I find that I like best to 
work out-of-doors. First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in 
quarter scale (approximately **f inches) in which I pay particular attention 
to the design principles of three simple values- the lightest 
light, the middle tone, and the darkest dark- by reducing the forms 
of my subject to these large patterns. If a human figure or wild life 
are to be part of the projected final picture, I try to place them 
in the initial sketch. For me, these will belong more completely to 
their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though
