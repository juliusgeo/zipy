suits from Simpson's in New York. Mantle, more concerned with 
dress, buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas and 
pays as much as $250 each. 

#LIGHT READING:#

Neither Mantle nor 
Maris need fear being classified an intellectual, but lately Mantle 
has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's 
"Tropic of Cancer". Mantle so appreciated Miller's delicate 
literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive 
passages aloud during road trips.   Mantle is not normally 
given to public speaking- or, for that matter, to private speaking. 
"What do you and Mickey talk about at home"? a reporter asked 
Maris recently.   "To tell you the truth", Maris said, "Mickey 
don't talk much".   This is no surprising trait for 
a ballplayer. What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris, 
under constant pressure from writers and photographers, are trying 
to be cooperative.   Of the two, Mantle is by nature the less 
outgoing, Maris the more outspoken. But last week, when a reporter 
was standing near Mantle's locker, Mickey walked up and volunteered 
an anecdote. "See that kid"? he said, pointing to a dark-haired 
11-year-old boy. "That's [Yogi] Berra's. I'll never 
forget one time I struck out three times, dropped a fly ball, and we 
lost the game. I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real low, 
and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says: 'You stunk'".

Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer all questions 
candidly and fully, but on rare occasions, he shuns newsmen. "When 
I've made a dumb play", he says, "I don't want to talk to 
anyone. I'm angry".   By his own confession, Maris is an 
angry young man. Benched at Tulsa in 1955, he told manager Dutch Meyer: 
"I can't play for you. Send me where I can play". (Meyer 
sent him to Reading, Pa&.) Benched at Indianapolis in 1956, 
he told manager Kerby Farrell: "I'm not learning anything on 
the bench. Play me". (Farrell did- and Maris led the team to victory 
in the Little World Series.) "That's the way I am", 
he says. "I tell people what I think. If you're a good ballplayer, 
you've got to get mad. Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll 
give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of 
ten times". 

#IDOLS' IDOLS:#

One good indication of the two 
men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes. 
Maris's was Ted Williams. "When I was a kid", Maris 
told a sportswriter last week, "I used to follow Williams every day 
in the box score, just to see whether he got a hit or not".

"When you came up to the majors, did you seek out Williams for advice"?

"Are you kidding"? said Maris. "You're 
afraid to talk to a guy you idolize".   Mantle's hero was Joe 
DiMaggio. "When Mickey went to the Yankees", says Mark Freeman, 
an ex-Yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver, "DiMaggio 
still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker, 
just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man, this 
hero of his. But DiMaggio never said a word. It crushed Mickey. 
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star, this 
never would be said of him". Mantle has kept the vow. Among all 
the Yankees, he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.   Neither 
Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else. 
If laying ties on a railroad track, which he once did for $1 an hour, 
paid more than playing right field for the Yankees, Maris would 
lay ties on a railroad track. If working in a zinc mine, which he once 
did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than playing center field for 
the Yankees, Mantle would work in a zinc mine. But since railroading 
and mining are not the highest paid arts, Mantle and Maris concentrate 
on baseball. They try to play baseball the best they can.

Each is a complete ballplayer. Mantle, beyond any question, can 
do more things well. ("One of the reasons they get along fine", 
says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men, "is that both 
realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris".) Hitting, 
Mantle 
has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed, 
Maris only left-handed. They both possess near classic 
stances, 
dug in firmly, arms high, set for fierce swings. Mantle is considerably 
better hitting for average (.332, fourth in the league, to .280 
for Maris so far this year).   Both are good bunters: Maris 
once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues; Mantle 
is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base. Both have brilliant 
speed: Mantle was timed from home plate (batting left-handed) to 
first base in 3.1 seconds, faster than any other major leaguer; Maris 
ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a 
race against Luis Aparicio, the swift, base-stealing shortstop of the 
White Sox. Both are good, daring fielders: Mantle covers more 
ground; Maris's throwing arm is stronger.   Yet with all their 
skills, the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one 
basic: The home run. With this ultimate weapon, the two Yankees 
may have saved baseball from its dullest season. (American League expansion 
created, inevitably, weaker teams. Only two teams in each league 
[the Yankees and Detroit, the Dodgers and Cincinnati] are battling 
for first place.   Appropriately, the emphasis on the home 
run, at a peak this year, came into being at baseball's lowest moment. 
In 1920, as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired 
to lose the World Series leaked out, fans grew disillusioned 
and disinterested in baseball. Something was needed to revive interest; 
the something was the home run.

Into Washington on President-elect John F& Kennedy's 
Convair, the <Caroline>, winged Actor-Crooner {Frank Sinatra} 
and his close Hollywood pal, Cinemactor Peter Lawford, Jack 
Kennedy's brother-in-law. Also included in the entourage: a dog 
in a black sweater, Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission: to stage 
a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's 
National Guard Armory. Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas, as 
he had hinted upon his arrival: "It's really tremendous when you 
think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia. I could talk to 
you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans"! 
As the plans were laid, some several thousand fat cats were to 
be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced 
at $10,000 each. The biggest single act would doubtless be staged 
by Frankie himself: his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by 
Hollywood Couturier Don Loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles. 
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered 
"two of everything" just "in case he spills anything", Frankie 
got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch 
of Loper clothing. @ ##

A year after he was catapulted over 
nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps, 
General {David M& Shoup} delivered a peppery annual report 
in the form of a "happy, warless New Year" greeting to his 
Pentagon staff. Said Leatherneck Shoup: "A year ago I took the 
grips of the plow in my hands. After pushing an accumulation of vines 
and weeds from the moldboard, I lifted the lines from the dust and 
found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on. Little 
geeing and hawing have been necessary". But Shoup also gave 
the Corps a tilling in spots. Speaking of "pride", he deplored 
the noncommissioned officer "whose uniform looks like it belonged to 
someone who retired in 1940; the officer with the yellow socks or 
the bay window. A few of these people are still around". @ ## 

Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U&S& Senate, then 
went their respective ways. At a reception for new members of Congress, 
Oregon Democrat {Maurine Neuberger}, taking the Senate seat 
held by her husband Richard until his death last March, got a brotherly

Ambassador-designate to the U&N&. Meanwhile, after 24 years 
in the Senate, Rhode Island's durable Democrat {Theodore 
Francis Greene}- having walked, swum and cerebrated himself to 
the hearty age of 93- left that august body (voluntarily, because he 
could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November), 
as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate. @ ##

The 
most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is 
a current bobby-sox idol, Dreamboat Cacophonist {Fabian} (real 
name: Fabian Forte), 17, and last week it developed that he will remain 
an undergraduate for a while. The principal of the school announced 
that- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia- 
Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics. 
Lacking his needed credits in those subjects, Fabian will not 
graduate with his old classmates next week. South Philadelphia High's 
principal added that the current delay was caused by the "pressure" 
of a movie that the toneless lad was making. @ ##

Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand

"I'm a slob", he announced. "My taste is gaudy. I'm

One of Nikita 
Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers, the U&S&S&R&'s 
daily <Izvestia>, enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian 
{Charlie Chaplin} at his Swiss villa, where he has been in 
self-exile since 1952. Chaplin, 71, who met K& when the Soviet boss 
visited England in 1956, confided that he hopes to visit Russia 
some time this summer because "I have marveled at your grandiose experiment 
and I believe in your future". Then Charlie spooned out 
some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed: "I was captivated 
by his humor, frankness and good nature and by his kind, strong 
and somewhat sly face".

G& David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards
