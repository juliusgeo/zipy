Styka studied his captain. He almost broke into tears. To him, Andrei 
Androfski had always been the living symbol of a Polish officer. 
His captain was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots were worn 
and shabby.   "Remember to call me Jan", Andrei said.

Styka nodded and sniffed and blew his nose vociferously. "When 
that woman found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy 
since before the war".   "I'm lucky that you were still 
living in Lublin".   Styka grumbled about fate. "For a time 
I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces, but one thing 
led to another. I got a girl in trouble and we had to get married. 
Not a bad girl. So we have three children and responsibilities. I 
work at the granary. Nothing like the old days in the army, but I 
get by. Who complains? Many times I tried to reach you, but I never 
knew how. I came to Warsaw twice, but there was that damned ghetto 
wall **h"   "I understand".   Styka blew his nose 
again.   "Were you able to make the arrangements"? Andrei 
asked.   "There is a man named Grabski who is the foreman in 
charge of the bricklayers at Majdanek. I did exactly as instructed. 
I told him you are on orders from the Home Army to get inside Majdanek 
so you can make a report to the government in exile in London".

"His answer"?   "Ten thousand zlotys".

"Can he be trusted"?   "He is aware he will not live 
for twenty-four hours if he betrays you".   "Good man, Styka".

"Captain **h Jan **h must you go inside Majdanek? 
The stories **h Everyone really knows what is happening there".

"Not everyone, Styka".   "What good will it really 
do"?   "I don't know. Perhaps **h perhaps **h there 
is a shred of conscience left in the human race. Perhaps if they know 
the story there will be a massive cry of indignation".   "Do 
you really believe that, Jan"?   "I have to believe it".

Styka shook his head slowly. "I am only a simple soldier. 
I cannot think things out too well. Until I was transferred into 
the Seventh Ulanys I was like every other Pole in my feeling about 
Jews. I hated you when I first came in. But **h my captain might 
have been a Jew, but he wasn't a Jew. What I mean is, he was a 
Pole and the greatest soldier in the Ulanys. Hell, sir. The men of 
our company had a dozen fights defending your name. You never knew about 
it, but by God, we taught them respect for Captain Androfski".

Andrei smiled.   "Since the war I have seen the way 
the Germans have behaved and I think, Holy Mother, we have behaved 
like this for hundreds of years. Why"?   "How can you 
tell an insane man to reason or a blind man to see"?   "But 
we are neither blind nor insane. The men of your company would not 
allow your name dishonored. Why do we let the Germans do this"?

"I have sat many hours with this, Styka. All I ever wanted 
was to be a free man in my own country. I've lost faith, Styka. 
I used to love this country and believe that someday we'd win our 
battle for equality. But now I think I hate it very much". 
"And do you really think that the world outside Poland will care 
any more than we do"?   The question frightened Andrei.

"Please don't go inside Majdanek".   "I'm still 
a soldier in a very small way, Styka".   It was an answer that 
Styka understood.   Grabski's shanty was beyond the bridge 
over the River Bystrzyca near the rail center. Grabski sat in a sweat-saturated 
undershirt, cursing the excessive heat which clamped an uneasy 
stillness before sundown. He was a square brick of a man with a 
moon-round face and sunken Polish features. Flies swarmed around the 
bowl of lentils in which he mopped thick black bread. Half of it dripped 
down his chin. He washed it down with beer and produced a deep-seated 
belch.   "Well"? Andrei demanded.   Grabski 
looked at the pair of them. He grunted a sort of "yes" answer. "My 
cousin works at the Labor Bureau. He can make you work papers. 
It will take a few days. I will get you inside the guard camp as a 
member of my crew. I don't know if I can get you into the inner camp. 
Maybe yes, maybe no, but you can observe everything from the roof 
of a barrack we are building".   Grabski slurped his way to the 
bottom of the soup bowl. "Can't understand why the hell anyone 
wants to go inside that son-of-a-bitch place".   "Orders from 
the Home Army".   "Why? Nothing there but Jews".

Andrei shrugged. "We get strange orders".   "Well- 
what about the money"?   Andrei peeled off five one-thousand-zloty 
notes. Grabski had never seen so much money. His broad flat 
fingers, petrified into massive sausages by years of bricklaying, snatched 
the bills clumsily. "This ain't enough".   "You 
get the rest when I'm safely out of Majdanek".   "I ain't 
taking no goddamned chances for no Jew business".   Andrei 
and Styka were silent.

She was getting real dramatic. I'd have been more impressed 
if I hadn't remembered that she'd played Hedda Gabler in her 
highschool dramatics course. I didn't want her back on that broken 
record.   "Nothing's free in the whole goddam world", was 
all I could think of to say. When I'd delivered myself of that 
gem there was nothing to do but order up another drink.   "I 
am", she said.   I'd forgotten all about Thelma and the Kentucky 
Derby and how it was Thelma's fifty dollars I was spending. 
It was just me and Eileen getting drunk together like we used to in 
the old days, and me staring at her across the table crazy to get my 
hands on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck because she was 
so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch. Drunk 
or sober she was the most attractive woman in the world for me. I was 
crazy about her all over again. It was the call of the wild all right.

That evening turned out to be hell like all the others. We 
moved down Broadway from ginmill to ginmill. It was the same old routine. 
Eileen got to dancing, just a little tiny dancing step to a hummed 
tune that you could hardly notice, and trying to pick up strange 
men, but each time I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she'd 
pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet 
husky voice about the good times and the happiness we'd had together 
and there I was back on the hook.   I did have the decency to 
call up Thelma and tell her I'd met old friends and would be home 
late.   "I could scratch her eyes out", Eileen cried and stamped 
her foot when I came back from the phone booth. "You know I 
don't like my men to have other women. I hate it. I hate it".

She got so drunk I had to take her home. It was a walk up on 
Hudson Street. She just about made me carry her upstairs and then 
she clung to me and wouldn't let me go.   There was a man's 
jacket on the chair and a straw hat on the table. The place smelt of 
some kind of hair lotion these pimplike characters use. "What about 
Ballestre"? I had to shake her to make her listen. "Precious. 
What about him"?   Suddenly she was very mysterious and dramatic. 
"Precious and I allow each other absolute freedom. We are 
above being jealous. He's used to me bringing home strange men. I'll 
just tell him you're my husband. He can't object to that".

"Well I object. If he pokes his nose in here I'll slug 
him".   "That really would be funny".   She began 
to laugh. She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling 
her on the bed. After all I'm made of flesh and blood. I'm 
not a plaster saint.   Waking up was horrible. Never in my life 
have I felt so remorseful about anything I've done as I did about 
spending that night with my own wife.   We both had hangovers. 
Eileen declared she couldn't lift her head from the pillow. She 
lay under the covers making jabbing motions with her forefinger telling 
me where to look for the coffeepot. I was stumbling in my undershirt 
trying to find my way around her damn kitchenette when I smelt that 
sickish sweet hairtonic smell. There was somebody else in the apartment.

I stiffened. Honest I could feel the hair stand up on the 
back of my neck like a dog's that is going to get into a fight. I 
turned around with the percolator in my hand. My eyes were so bleary 
I could barely see him but there he was, a little smooth olivefaced 
guy in a new spring overcoat and a taffycolored fedora. Brown eyes, 
eyebrow mustache. Oval face without an expression in the world.

We didn't have time to speak before Eileen's voice was screeching 
at us from the bed. "Joseph Maria Ballestre meet Francis Xavier 
Bowman. Exboyfriend meet exhusband". She gave the nastiest laugh 
I ever heard. "And don't either of you forget that I'm not 
any man's property. If you want to fight, go down on the sidewalk". 
She was enjoying the situation. Imagine that.   Eileen 
was a psychologist all right. Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard 
I found myself having a fellowfeeling for him. Maybe he felt the 
same way. I never felt such a lowdown hound in my life. First thing 
I knew he was in the kitchenette cooking up the breakfast and I was 
handing Eileen her coffeecup and she was lying there handsome as a 
queen among her courtiers.   I couldn't face Thelma after that 
night. I didn't even have the nerve to call her on the telephone. 
I wrote her that I'd met up with Eileen and that old bonds had proved 
too strong and asked her to send my clothes down by express. Of 
course I had to give her Eileen's address, but she never came near 
us. All she did was write me a pleasant little note about how it was 
beautiful while it lasted but that now life had parted our ways and 
it was goodbye forever. She never said a word about the fifty dollars. 
She added a postscript begging me to be careful about drinking. I 
must know that that was my greatest weakness underlined three times.

Afterwards I learned that Eileen had called Thelma on the telephone 
and made a big scene about Thelma trying to take her husband 
away. That finished me with Thelma. Trust Eileen to squeeze all the 
drama out of a situation.   And there I was shacked up with Eileen 
in that filthy fourth floor attic on Hudson Street. I use the 
phrase advisedly because there was something positively indecent about 
our relationship. I felt it and it ate on me all the time, but I 
didn't know how right I was till later.   What I did know was 
that Precious was always around. He slept in the hall bedroom at the 
head of the stairs. "Who do you think pays the rent? You wouldn't 
have me throw the poor boy out on the street", Eileen said when 
I needled her about it. I said sure that was what I wanted her 
to do but she paid no attention. Eileen had a wonderful way of not listening 
to things she didn't want to hear. Still I didn't think 
she was twotiming me with Precious right then. To be on the safe side 
I never let Eileen get out of my sight day or night.   Precious 
had me worried. I couldn't make out what his racket was. I'd 
thought him a pimp or procurer but he didn't seem to be. He was smooth 
and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under 
his selfeffacing manner. Still he let Eileen treat him like a valet. 
Whenever the place was cleaned or a meal served it was Precious 
who did the work.   I never could find out what his business was. 
He always seemed to have money in his pocket. The phone had been 
disconnected but telegrams came for him and notes by special messenger. 
Now and then he would disappear for several days. "Connections" 
was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile when I put leading 
questions. "Oh he's just an international spy", Eileen would 
shout with her screechy laugh.   Poor devil he can't have been 
too happy either. He got no relief from drink because, though sometimes 
Precious would buy himself a drink if he went out with us in the 
evening, he'd leave it on the table untouched.   When I was in
