everybody. And when they spoke they spoke to each other and not 
to me. And after I brought them sandwiches and coffee I had to go back 
to my place in the kitchen and wait.   Sitting in the kitchen 
I recalled every word Mrs& Salter said that could have been a sign 
to me. "If I am not to be Mrs& Salter then I am nothing". 
Why didn't that alarm me then? And when she returned from taking 
her guests back to New York she had said, "All they talked about 
was Harvie **h Harvie this, Harvie that **h When they know the 
truth will they drop away from me, will I become a nothing"? And 
then I remembered a few years before after their return from a short 
trip to Rome I had heard her boast, over and over again, "On the 
boat people liked me for myself".   I had made a habit of calling 
her at night from my cottage, just to check. The last night I 
had called, but the line was always busy and it reassured me. I assumed 
it was one of those hour-long conversations with Dolly or Constance, 
she comfortable in bed. But it seemed not from what they were saying. 
Then was it a final desperate plea from her, to whom? **h hanging 
on and on past any man's patience **h some final stab of conclusion? 
@   She was found the day after at the bottom of the cliff. 
I tried to believe that what must have happened was that, restless, 
disturbed by this telephone call or whatever, she walked out in the 
night, as she had a habit of doing. Sometimes she took the path that 
winds up around my cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff. It's 
so romantic up there, she used to say, with the broad river gleaming 
in its moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sounds of 
the night, so poetic. With all that warm rain and the fog it might have 
been as simple as a loosened rock, a misstep.   But I didn't 
really think it was as simple as that, nor did anyone else. When a 
fisherman brought her up in his arms, still, small, as if she were a 
child asleep, I began to shudder with a terrible excitement, almost triumphant, 
that I still cannot account for. Was it a hysterical release 
from the long strain of vigilance of those weeks? that at last the 
vigilance, the will gives way? Or what was it that, before Via, 
Sonny, Walter and all, I began almost to dance with shuddering and 
cry out, "I knew she'd do it! I knew"!   Everyone stared 
at me and drew back. Their eyes turned cold and accusing, even 
Via's. And they have never changed.   At the same time that 
I thought 
I understood her at long last and pitied her, underneath this knowing 
had there burned unquenched by my pity a fire of hate, an enduring 
envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry? Was that what had given 
way in me? Even now I am appalled at how little anyone knows 
of what they really are. It is absurd of course to say that that one 
exclamation estranged me from the family I considered my very own, but 
there it hangs, a cooling void that broke our close connection with 
each other. At the time I was filled with self-pity at this separation, 
but in the years since I have come to understand that the sight 
of me was painful to them after that outcry. In my person they would 
always remember that last long time of me alone with her, so if they 
told themselves that I could have prevented it, I can understand that 
by now and love them still, because everyone must justify, have a scapegoat 
for what is not to be borne.   It is not their avoidance 
that rankles; it is when I meet someone who was a close friend of 
the 
family, and therefore of mine, and they nod to me so coolly and walk 
away, 
that it hurts. I could tell them, but no one ever asked, why I had 
cried out so triumphantly at the sight of her body. No, I forget 
Mrs& Mathias, who had been away visiting a married daughter when 
it happened. She haunted me; she persisted in explaining how and why 
she had advised Mrs& Salter to return to the country.   "We 
all feel guilty", I turned away from her coldly. "It was nobody's 
fault. She overplayed her hand".   "What do you mean"? 
she frowned.   "Why put such a high value on being top 
dog"? I added. It was coarse, almost insulting, this harsh appraisal, 
and she has never come to see me since.   But suppose she 
had not taken Mrs& Mathias' advice and lived on like thousands 
of women in towns, dispossessed of love, hanging on to makeshifts, and 
altogether and finally arid. If she chose, and in that final decision 
discarded, what, above all, all of us value, life itself, must she 
not have risen to her fullest height, and transcending her murky self, 
felt at last the passion of a great moral decision? If they say I 
could have stopped her it is because they are ignorant of her last weeks 
of self-examination, her search into herself and its conclusions.

Yes, I had cried out that I knew she'd do it, but without 
my fully realizing it at the time, it was a cry of triumph for her, praise 
at her deliverance from pettiness and greed- and guilt. She was 
finally at rest in truth, of her own proud free choice. At rest with 
my darling Ellen, the first Mrs& Salter. ##

MR& SALTER 
came home. The funeral service was in the house, the Methodist minister, 
how clean and glistening his eyeglasses and his neat body standing 
beside that coffin with that doll inside, a stranger speaking to 
strangers the old sacred words, and the rain drumming incessantly in 
accompaniment, seven days of relentless rain that turned the ground to 
mud so the burial had to be postponed. I waited. Then Via called to 
say they had decided to cremate her- as they had Ellen, the thought 
leaped to my mind- and did I want to meet her at the funeral home 
the next morning.   The coffin stood on trestles in a corner of 
the long low dimly lit funeral parlor, on its dark shining surface the 
sheaf of white roses I had ordered. I knelt, just for decency I 
thought at the time, but found myself whispering, "Our Father which 
Art in Heaven **h" And it was only after that that something unlocked 
in me and I felt a grief.   Via was in the parking lot when 
I went outside. Together we waited in her car until the hearse moved 
out and we followed it down into the heavy traffic of New Jersey.

By the time we arrived and entered the building sacred music 
was already swelling out into the chapel-like auditorium with its discreet 
symbols of religious faiths. Again I felt impelled to kneel, 
and reached back and pulled Via down. Something would come into her 
heart **h if nothing else the sounds of Bach would give her some healing. 
"I had a rather small place of my own. A nice bachelor apartment in 
a place called the Lancaster Arms".   "Uhhu", she said, 
hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid.   "And then 
I had another place farther downtown I used as a studio". 
"Uhhu".   "I'm not a man who has many close intimate friends, 
Carla", he said, wanting her to know all about him. "Oh, 
I'd drink with newspaper people. I think I was what you might call 
a convivial man, and yet it was when I was alone in my studio, doing 
my work, that I really felt alive. But I think a man needs at least 
one intimate friend to communicate with". Pausing, he waited for 
her to turn, to ask a question. She showed no interest at all in the 
life he had led back home, and it hurt him a little. "Well, what 
about you, Carla"?   "Me"? she asked, turning slowly. 
"What about me"?   "Did you make friends easily"?

"Umm, uhhu".   "Somehow I imagine that as you grew 
up you were alone a lot. How about it"?   "I guess so", 
she said taking a Kleenex from her purse. When she had wiped some 
of the lipstick from her mouth, she stared solemnly at her image in the 
mirror.   "Are your people still alive"? he asked, trying 
to touch a part of her life Alberto hadn't discussed; so he 
could 
have something of her for himself. "You talk so well, Carla", 
he went on. "You seem to have read so much, you have a natural gift 
for words", he added, trying to flatter her vanity. "You must have 
been good at history at school. Where did you go to school"?

"What is this"? she asked, turning suddenly. "Don't 
you know all about me by this time? My name's Carla Caneli. This 
is my town. I sleep with you. You know something more about me every 
day, don't you? Would you be happier if I made up some stories 
about my life, told you some lies? Why are you trying to worry 
me"?   "I'm not trying to worry you".   "Well, 
all right then".   The cleansing tissues she had been using had 
been falling on the floor, and he got up and picked up one, then another, 
hoping she would notice what he was doing. At home he had been 
a clean orderly man, and now he had to hide his annoyance. Was she just 
naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance? he 
wondered. Would he have to clean up after her every day, clean the 
kitchen, the bathroom, and get down on his knees and scrub the kitchen 
floor, then hang up her dresses, pick up her stockings, make the bed 
while she lay around? He straightened up, ready to vent his exasperation, 
then grew afraid. If he dwelt on the indignities he suffered 
he would lose all respect for her, and without the respect he might lose 
his view of her, too.   "What's the matter"? she asked 
suddenly.   "Nothing. Nothing at all", he said quietly. "Let's 
go out".   "Are those the only shoes you have, Sam"?

"What's the matter with them"?   "The 
heavy thick soles. Look at them".   "They're an expensive 
English shoe for walking around a lot. I like them".   "Sam, 
no one around here wears such heavy soles. Can't you get another 
pair"?   "Maybe I could", he said, surprised that she 
could turn from herself and notice anything about him. "I'll get 
an elegant pair of thin-soled Italian shoes tomorrow, Carla".

"And I don't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit", 
she said, making a face.   "What's the matter with it"? 
He had put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slacks and the 
fawn-colored shirt he had worn that first night in Rome when he had 
encountered her on the street.   "Oh, Sam. You look like a tweedy 
Englishman. Can't you wear something else and look a little 
more as though you belonged"?   "I don't mind at all", 
he said, delighted with her attention. Changing his clothes, he put 
on his dark-blue flannel suit, and laid away the gray jacket with the 
feeling that he might be putting it aside for good. But it was a hopeful 
sign, he told himself. She no longer wanted anything about him to 
remind her of the circumstances of their meeting that first night in 
Parioli.   That day they loafed around, just getting the feel 
of the city. They looked at the ruins of the old Roman wall on the lower 
Via Veneto, then they went to the Farnese Gardens. She had some 
amusing scandal about the Farneses in the old days. Then they took 
a taxi to Trastevere. "There's a church you should see", she 
said. And when they stood by the fountain in the piazza looking at 
Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face, not letting on he had been 
there with Alberto. He let her tell him all about the church. Then 
they had dinner. All evening she was eloquent and pleased with herself. 
When they got home at midnight she was tired out. And in the morning 
when he woke up at ten the church bells were ringing.   He 
had never heard so many bells, and as he lay there listening, he thought 
of her scolding him for his remarks when he had looked up at the 
obelisk and the church at the top of the Spanish Steps. It was a good 
thing that she clung to her religion, he thought. She might like to 
take him to St& Peter's.   "Carla, wake up", he said 
shaking her. "It's ten o'clock. Aren't you going out to mass? 
You could take me to St& Peter's".   "Uhhu", she 
muttered.   "Come on, you'll be late".   "I think 
I'll sleep in this morning", she said drowsily, and as she snuggled 
against him, he wondered if she ever went to church. Why did he 
want her to go to church? he wondered **h Probably because it was 
a place where she might get a feeling of certainty and security. It would 
be good for her. It was too bad he had no feeling himself for church. 
Not his poor mother's fault. She would have been better off 
if she had stuck to her Bible. As for himself, he just didn't have 
the temperament for it. From the time he had been at college he had 
achieved a certain tranquility and composure by accepting the fact that
