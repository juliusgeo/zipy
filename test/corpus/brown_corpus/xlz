along the base of each figure, or more precisely by referring to the 
original data in the appropriate tables.   The difference between 
the sequence of Onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering 
sequence in Figures 3 and 4. This difference is readily clarified 
by referring to Table 1. For example, arrow 17 in Figure 3 portrays 
the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34, whereas the same epiphysis 
for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in Figure 4. For the boy, 
this epiphysis was markedly delayed at Onset but near the mean at Completion. 
Thus, the Span of its ossification was shortened and the center's 
ability to "catch up" in ossification is demonstrated. In 
contrast, for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at Onset 
and delayed at Completion. Obviously, the slowing for her may have 
occurred at any point between Onset and Completion. The Skeletal 
Age curve in the lower portion of Figure 2 shows that slowing may have 
occurred for her during the prepubescent period. Length of the shaft 
of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation 
values for each center in Table 1.   We have attempted to simplify 
the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of 
each child- more than 1700 values for the entire group- by constructing 
figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 
boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center. 
Figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for 
each growth center. Forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the 
original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this 
monograph have been included in the Appendix.   The principles 
used in making each arrow for Figures 3 and 4 were applied to the 
construction of Figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the Appendix. 
One growth center in a short bone- distal phalanx of the second 
finger- was chosen as an example for discussion here, primarily because 
epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion, the maturity indicator for Completion 
in long and short bones, occurs in this center for girls near the 
menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage. Its Completion 
thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include 
in studies of growth, dietary patterns, and health during adolescence.

The following summary, based on Figures 5 and 6, is an 
example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset 
ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the 
appropriate mean age for each growth center. At the top of Figure 5, 
for example, the Onset range and Completion range lines for the chosen 
growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and 
standard deviation values in Table 1. The 34 arrows, denoting onset 
age plus completion age deviations, have been arrayed in an Onset 
sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest Onset of the 
34 girls. The growth center depicted here, in the distal phalanx of the 
second finger, is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones. 
The mean onset age was 25.3 months (Table 1), and the average 
Span of the osseous stage was 133 months. The correlation (Table 2) 
between onset age and completion age was +.50, and that between onset 
age and Span was -.10. With due consideration for the limits of precision 
in assessing, expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 
2 years, and the known variations in rate of ossification of these 
children as described in our preceding paper in the Supplement, each 
arrow with a "shaft length" of four months or less was selected as 
indicating "same schedule" at Onset and Completion, for this particular 
epiphysis. Accordingly, girls 31, 29, 33, 21, 26, 13, 3, 4, 
14, 32, 24, 25, 34, 23, 6, 15, 22, and 16 may be said to have the "same 
schedule" at Onset and Completion.   It seems clear, from 
the counter-balanced shape of the series of arrows in Figure 5 that 
there was about an equal number of early and late Onsets and Completions 
for the 34 girls. Accordingly, if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion 
occurs in this phalanx near menarche, early and late menarches might 
have been forecast rather precisely at the time of Onset of ossification 
for the 18 girls with "same schedule". As an example of the interpretation 
of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft 
length in conjunction with its position in the figure: girl 2 had 
a delayed Onset and further delayed Completion. It is of interest 
that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls 
in this group.   A similar analysis of Figure 6 for the 34 boys 
would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value 
of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage. 
Boys 32, 23, 31, 17, 30, 19, and 24 had "same schedule" at Onset 
and Completion; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage 
would appear possible for only seven boys. Boy 34, like girl 2, did not 
have "same schedule"; his arrow crosses the line denoting the 
mean. The "dot" on his arrow indicates early Onset and the "tip" 
indicates relatively later Completion.   After the 42 figures 
had been drawn like Figures 5 and 6, classifications of the onset 
ages and completion ages were summarized from them. 
Interestingly enough, the effect of the digitalis glycosides is inhibited 
by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and 
is enhanced by the absence of potassium (Wolff, 1960). _B. ORGANIFICATION 
OF IODINE_ The precise mechanism for organification of iodine 
in the thyroid is not as yet completely understood. However, the formation 
of organically bound iodine, mainly mono-iodotyrosine, can be 
accomplished in cell-free systems. In the absence of additions to the 
homogenate, the product formed is an iodinated particulate protein (Fawcett 
and Kirkwood, 1953; Taurog, Potter and Chaikoff, 1955; 
Taurog, Potter, Tong, and Chaikoff, 1956; Serif and Kirkwood, 
1958; De Groot and Carvalho, 1960). This iodoprotein does not 
appear 
to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid, and there 
is no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro 
by cell-free systems. In addition, the iodoamino acid formed in largest 
quantity in the intact thyroid is di-iodotyrosine. If tyrosine 
and a system generating hydrogen peroxide are added to a cell-free homogenate 
of the thyroid, large quantities of free mono-iodotyrosine can 
be formed (Alexander, 1959). It is not clear whether this system 
bears any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism, and a system 
generating peroxide has not been identified in thyroid tissue. On chemical 
grounds it seems most likely that iodide is first converted to 
**f and then to **f as the active iodinating species. In the thyroid 
gland it appears that proteins (chiefly thyroglobulin) are iodinated 
and that free tyrosine and thyronine are not iodinated. Iodination of 
tyrosine, however, is not enough for the synthesis of hormone. The mono- 
and di-iodotyrosine must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine and 
thyroxine. The mechanism of this coupling has been studied in some detail 
with non-enzymatic systems in vitro and can be simulated by certain 
di-iodotyrosine analogues (Pitt-Rivers and James, 1958). There 
is so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this coupling is 
under enzymatic control.   The chemical nature of the iodocompounds 
is discussed below (pp& 76 et seq&). _C. THYROGLOBULIN SYNTHESIS_ 
Little is known of the synthetic mechanisms for formation of 
thyroglobulin. Its synthesis has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems, 
nor has its synthesis by systems with intact thyroid cells in 
vitro been unequivocally proven. There is some reason to think that thyroglobulin 
synthesis may proceed independently of iodination, for in 
certain transplantable tumours of the rat thyroid containing essentially 
no iodinated thyroglobulin, a protein that appears to be thyroglobulin 
has been observed in ultracentrifuge experiments (Wolff, Robbins 
and Rall, 1959). Similar findings have been noted in a patient with 
congenital absence of the organification enzymes, whose thyroid tissue 
could only concentrate iodide. In addition, depending on availability 
of dietary iodine, thyroglobulin may contain varying quantities of 
iodine. _D. SECRETION_ Since the circulating thyroid hormones are 
the amino acids thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine (cf& Section C), 
it is clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for their 
release from proteins before secretion. The presence of several proteases 
and peptidases has been demonstrated in the thyroid. One of 
the proteases has ~pH optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 
(McQuillan, Stanley and Trikojus, 1954; Alpers, Robbins and Rall, 
1955). The finding that the concentration of one of these proteases 
is increased in thyroid glands from ~TSH-treated animals suggests 
that this protease may be active in vivo. There is no conclusive 
evidence yet that either of the proteases has been prepared in highly 
purified form nor is their specificity known. A study of their activity 
on thyroglobulin has shown that thyroxine is not preferentially released 
and that the degradation proceeds stepwise with the formation 
of macromolecular intermediates (Alpers, Petermann and Rall, 1956). 
Besides proteolytic enzymes the thyroid possesses de-iodinating enzymes. 
A microsomal de-iodinase with a ~pH optimum of around 8, and requiring 
reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity, has been 
identified in the thyroid (Stanbury, 1957). This de-iodinating enzyme 
is effective against mono- and di-iodotyrosine, but does not de-iodinate 
thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine. It is assumed that the iodine released 
from the iodotyrosines remains in the iodide pool of the thyroid, 
where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin. The thyroxine 
and tri-iodothyronine released by proteolysis and so escaping 
de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream. It has been 
shown that thyroglobulin binds thyroxine, but the binding does not appear 
to be particularly strong. It has been suggested that the plasma 
thyroxine-binding proteins, which have an extremely high affinity for 
thyroxine, compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine (Ingbar and Freinkel, 
1957). _E. ANTITHYROID DRUGS_ Antithyroid drugs are of two 
general types. One type has a small univalent anion of the 
thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoroboride 
type. This ion inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis 
by interfering with iodide concentration in the thyroid. It does 
not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism as such. The other 
group of antithyroid agents or drugs is typified by thiouracil. These 
drugs have no effect on the iodide concentrating mechanism, but they 
inhibit organification. The mechanism of action of these drugs has not 
been completely worked out, but certain of them appear to act by reducing 
the oxidised form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin 
(Astwood, 1954). On the other hand, there are a few antithyroid drugs 
of this same general type, such as resorcinol, possessing no reducing 
activity and possibly acting through formation of a complex with molecular 
iodine. Any of the antithyroid drugs, of either type, if given 
in large enough doses for a long period of time will cause goitre, owing 
to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis, with production of hypothyroidism. 
The anterior lobe of the pituitary then responds by an increased 
output of ~TSH, causing the thyroid to enlarge. The effect 
of drugs that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteracted 
by addition of relatively large amounts of iodine to the diet. 
The antithyroid drugs of the thiouracil type, however, are not antagonised 
by such means. Besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol 
types, certain antithyroid drugs have been found in naturally occurring 
foods. The most conclusively identified is L-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone, 
which was isolated from rutabaga (Greer, 1950). It is presumed 
to occur in other members of the Brassica family. There is some 
evidence that naturally occurring goitrogens may play a role in the development 
of goitre, particularly in Tasmania and Australia (Clements 
and Wishart, 1956). There it seems that the goitrogen ingested by 
dairy 
animals is itself inactive but is converted in the animal to an active 
goitrogen, which is then secreted in the milk. _F. DIETARY INFLUENCES_ 
Besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet, the level of 
iodine itself in the diet plays a major role in governing the activity 
of the thyroid gland. In the experimental animal and in man gross 
deficiency in dietary iodine causes thyroid hyperplasia, hypertrophy and 
increased thyroid activity (Money, Rall and Rawson, 1952; Stanbury, 
Brownell, Riggs, Perinetti, Itoiz, and Del Castillo, 1954). 
In man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary 
to prevent development of goitre is about 100 ~|mg per day. With 
lower levels, thyroid hypertrophy and increased thyroid blood-flow 
enable the thyroid to accumulate a larger proportion of the daily intake 
of iodine. Further, the gland is able to re-use a larger fraction 
of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally. In the presence of 
a low iodine intake, thyroglobulin labelled in vivo with **f is found 
to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal, the amounts of di-iodotyrosine
