
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants, it's 
time to set them out where they are to remain. Every time you transplant 
a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller. The moral is: 
don't transplant it any oftener than you must. As soon as they 
are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches apart where they are 
to bloom. I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed 
bone meal into each hole with the plant. That encourages rooting, and 
the better developed the roots, the larger and more plentiful the flowers.

Pansies are gluttons. I doubt if it is possible to overfeed 
them. I spade lots of compost into their bed; lacking that, 
decayed manure spread over the bed is fine. One year I simply set the 
plants in the remains of a compost pile, to which a little sand had 
been added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my, or any of my 
neighbors' experience. In addition to the rich soil they benefit by 
feedings of manure water every other week, diluted to the color of weak 
tea. As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved in water 
to half the strength in the directions, may be used.   They 
need mulch. We put a light mulch over the seedlings; now we must use 
a heavy one. Three inches of porous material will do a good job of 
keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.   When winter comes 
be ready with additional mulch. I like hay for this and apply it 
so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost. That 
keeps in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate 
freezing and thawing.   Don't miss the pansies that appear 
from time to time through the winter. Whenever there is a thaw or 
a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or 
two. If those aren't enough for you, why not grow some just for winter 
blooming? The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February 
during a particularly cold winter. I started the seed in a flat 
in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame. (An unheated 
greenhouse would have been better, if I had had one.) The plants 
took zero nights in their stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over 
the glass to protect them. In response to the lengthening days of February 
they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers. That 
cold frame was my morale builder; its mass of bright bloom set in a 
border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it. Like 
strawberries in December, pansies are far more exciting in February 
than in May. Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold 
and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.

The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your plants becoming 
"leggy", running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms. 
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth, using a bobby 
pin to hold it there. Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and 
each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little 
plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season. As soon as an experimental 
tug assures you that roots have taken over, cut it off from 
the mother plant.   A second and also good practice is to shear 
off the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each 
branch. These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time 
and will behave just as they did in early spring. I like to shear half 
my plants at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while the 
second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.   Probably 
no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to 
let the blossoms go to seed. Nature's aim, different from ours, is 
to provide for the coming generation. That done, her work is accomplished 
and she ignores the plant.   Here is a word of advice when 
you go shopping for your pansy seeds. Go to a reputable grower, preferably 
a pansy specialist. It is no harder to raise big, healthy, blooming 
plants than weak, sickly little things; in fact it is easier. But 
you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.   Many 
people think that pansies last only a few weeks, then their period 
of growth and bloom is over. That is not true. If the plants are cared 
for and protected over the winter, the second year is more prolific 
than the first.   Would you like to grow exhibition pansies? 
Remove about half the branches from each plant, leaving only the strongest 
with the largest buds. The flowers will be huge.   Pansies 
have character. They stick to their principles, insist upon their 
due, but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it. Treat 
them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except 
the frigid ones. Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and more 
food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.

A SALAD WITH 
greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition 
to a meal, but add an avocado and you have something really special. 
This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past 
thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible 
to ship avocado anywhere in the United States. It has a great 
many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part 
of your diet yet, you really should.   You will find that avocado 
is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted. It is roughly shaped 
like a large pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin covers 
a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe 
Bartlett pear, but oily. The avocado should have a "give" to it, 
as you hold it, when it is ripe. The flavor is neither sweet, like 
a pear, nor tart like an orange; it is subtle and rather bland, nut-like. 
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to- not 
because it is unpleasant, but because the flavor is hard to define in 
the light of our experience with other fruits. Sometimes it takes several 
"eatings" of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste 
that has made it such a favorite throughout the world. Once you become 
an avocado fan, you will look forward to the season each year with 
eager anticipation. 

#NATURALLY DORMANT AND NO SPRAY DANGER#

Today, 
refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible 
to any place in the world. The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, 
but it is still firm at this point. It is brought to packing houses, 
cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed in protective 
excelsior. The fruit is then cooled to 42`F&, a temperature at which 
it lapses into a sort of dormant state. This cooling does not change 
the avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening of 
the fruit until a grovelike temperature (room temperature) is restored. 
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.   One 
of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require 
processing of any kind. There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing 
needed. If the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado will delay 
its ripening until needed. And unlike other fruits, one cannot eat 
the skin of the avocado. It is thick, much like an egg plant's skin, 
so that poison sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the 
consumer. 

#NUTRITIOUS AND A CHOLESTEROL REDUCER#

Good taste and 
versatility, 
plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend 
the frequent use of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were 
limited. Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients. Their main 
asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining 
the good health of the circulatory system. Aside from this, 
the average portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount of vitamins 
~A and ~C- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement, 
and about a third of the official vitamin ~E requirement. The 
~B vitamins are well represented, especially thiamin and riboflavin. 
Calcium, phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts, 
and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts. 
None of these values is destroyed, not significantly altered by refrigeration 
storage.   Dr& Wilson C& Grant, of the Veterans' 
Administration Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University 
of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if avocados, 
because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids, would reduce 
the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients. The study comprised 
16 male patients, ranging in age from 27 to 72. They were put 
on control diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal cholesterol 
level of their blood. Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados 
per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.

FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, FIRE! The tremendous energy 
released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than 
it can be heard. The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the 
pit of your stomach.   Never before has the introduction of a weapon 
caused so much apprehension and fear. Nuclear weapons are fearsome, 
but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless 
swiftness which is much more terrifying.   A great many writers 
are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker 
would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear 
rockets. It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that 
an attacker, in possession of such absolute power, would simultaneously 
destroy his opponent's cities and people. With a nation defenseless 
before it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people? 
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical 
act of complete subjugation? The nation would be utterly devastated. 
The will of its people, so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.

Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction 
in hours or days; and now rockets have given it the means 
to destroy itself in minutes. At this point it should be painfully obvious 
that cities, being "soft", and the people within them are ideally 
suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.   However, because 
this vulnerability is mutual, it is to the advantage of neither side 
to destroy the opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent 
has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal. It should be appallingly 
apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.

~ICBMs have given us a capability which could be used in 
two different ways. They could be used to attack a nation's people 
(which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people), 
or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military 
force.   If our national interest lies in being able to 
fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide, then we must 
take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles. We must 
determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves. We must make 
certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job 
to the missile.   Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they 
also have their too little known limitations.   Because of a missile's 
ballistic trajectory, the location of a fixed target must be 
known quite accurately. Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads, 
highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them with 
passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range 
ballistic missiles today- the extreme difficulty of destroying 
a mobile or moving target with such weapons. One must first <detect> 
a fleeting mobile or moving target, <decide> that it is worthy of 
destruction, <select> the missile to be fired against the target, 
<compute> ballistics for the flight, and <prepare> the missile for 
firing.   Even if all these operations could be performed <instantaneously>, 
the ~ICBM still has a time of flight to the target 
of about 30 minutes. Therefore, if the target can significantly change 
its location in something less than 30 minutes, the probability of 
having destroyed it is drastically lowered.   Because of this, 
it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic 
missiles will seek self-protection in mobility- at least until missile 
defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.

In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving, or imprecisely
