people rather sharply. _ISSUE NO& 4. WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS TO 
SCHOOLS 
THAT DENY CHILDREN ON ACCOUNT OF RACE._ This is the Powell Amendment, 
which in 1957 divided even a "liberal" group like the American 
Veterans Committee (~AVC). Should we support a clause in Federal 
school construction or school assistance legislation that would 
deny Federal funds to a school district that denies admission to a 
child on account of his race? This is softer than earlier Powell amendments 
which would have denied funds to all segregated school districts. 
There is nonetheless considerable argument against the clause, 
softened though it be, on the grounds that Federal aid is so necessary 
to the public schools. The Federal funds limitation enlists the support 
of many, the opposition of quite a few. _ISSUE NO& 5. 
REQUIRED 
PUBLIC EDUCATION._ Should a political subdivision, state or county 
or municipality, be required to furnish public education? For the 
school year, 1959-1960, the Prince Edward County (Virginia) Board 
of Supervisors voted not to provide funds for public education, and 
the school board therefore could provide no public education- for white 
or Negro children. Is public education in this American democracy 
of such importance that no child should be denied public education? 
Or is this subject a matter of self-determination, a matter of states 
rights or county rights? If people don't want to provide public 
education, should they be forced to do so? Even if we marshal substantial 
agreement behind mandatory public education, we likely cannot 
expect that all the states will enact the legislation. Should the 
requirement, which must therefore be Federal in nature, be legislated 
by the United States Congress? Or must it become law by amendment 
of the United States Constitution? We actually have two issues 
in this question- goal and method. _ISSUE NO& 6. FEDERAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
FOR EDUCATION OF THE CITIZENS._ If the above issue is settled 
by requiring public education for all citizens, Issue No& 6 may 
be moot. If, on the other hand, it is not settled, or while it is being 
debated and resolved, does the Federal government have a responsibility 
in situations like that in Prince Edward County? Nearly 
half the children still receive no education. Must or should the Federal 
government help? Should the government directly provide education 
for the children who want public education?

The next question is whether board members favor their own social 
classes in their roles as educational policy-makers. On the whole, 
it appears that they do not favor their own social classes in an explicit 
way. Seldom is there an issue in which class lines can be clearly 
drawn. A hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment 
of a free public junior college in a community where there already 
was a good private college which served the middle-class youth adequately 
but was too expensive for working-class youth. In situations 
of this sort the board generally favors the expansion of free education. 
Campbell studied the records of 172 school board members in twelve 
western cities over the period of 1931-40 and found "little or no 
relationship between certain social and economic factors and school 
board competence", as judged by a panel of professional educators who 
studied the voting records on educational issues.   The few cases 
of clear favoritism along social-class lines are as likely as not 
to involve representatives of the working class on the school board who 
favor some such practice as higher wages for janitors rather than pay 
increases for teachers, and such issues are not issues of educational 
policy.   In general, it appears that trustees and board members 
attempt to represent the public interest in their administration of 
educational policy, and this is made easier by the fact that the dominant 
values of the society are middle-class values, which are generally 
thought 
to be valid for the entire society. There have been very few cases 
of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any 
other class in the field of educational policy. If there were more such 
cases, it would be easier to answer the question whether the policy-makers 
favor their own social classes.   There is currently a major 
controversy of public education in which group interests and values 
are heavily engaged. This is the issue of segregated schools in the 
South. In this case it is primarily a matter of conflict of racial 
groups rather than social-class groups. Thus, the white middle and 
lower classes are arrayed against the Negro middle and lower classes. 
This conflict may be resolved in a way which will suit white middle-class 
people better than it suits white lower-class people. If this happens, 
there may be some class conflict in the South, with school boards 
and school teachers taking the middle-class position. 

#THE EDUCATIONAL 
PROFESSION#

The members of the educational profession have 
a major voice in the determination of educational policy, their position 
being strongest in the universities. They are mostly upper-middle- 
and lower-middle-class people, with a few in the upper class. Do they 
make class-biased decisions?   In a society dominated by middle-class 
values and working in an institution which transmits and strengthens 
these social values, it is clear that the educational profession 
must work for the values which are characteristic of the society. 
There is no problem here. The problem arises, if it does arise, when 
the educator has to make a choice or a decision within the area of his 
professional competence, but which bears some relation to the social 
structure. For instance, in giving school grades or in making recommendations 
for the award of a college scholarship, does he consciously 
or unconsciously favor students of one or another social class? Again, 
in deciding on the content and method of his teaching, does he favor 
a curriculum which will make his students stronger competitors in the 
race for higher economic status, or does he favor a curriculum which 
strengthens students in other ways?   The answers to questions 
such as these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator's 
own social-class position and also upon his social history, as well as 
upon his personality and what he conceives his mission to be as an educator. 
In a set of case studies of teachers with various social-class 
backgrounds, Wattenberg illustrates a variety of approaches to students 
and to teaching which depend upon the teacher's personality as 
well as on his social-class background. One upward-mobile teacher may 
be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupils because she wants them to 
develop the attitudes and skills that will enable them to climb, while 
another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with 
lower-class pupils because he knows their disadvantages and deprivations 
at home, and he hopes to encourage them by friendly treatment.

One social-class factor which plays a large part in educational policy 
today is the fact that a great many school and college teachers are 
upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class families. 
Their own experience in the social system influences their work and 
attitudes as teachers. While this influence is a complex matter, depending 
upon personality factors in the individual as well as upon his 
social-class experience, there probably are some general statements about 
social-class background and educational policy that can be made with 
a fair degree of truth.   Teachers who have been upward mobile 
probably see education as most valuable for their students if it serves 
students as it has served them; that is, they are likely to favor 
a kind of education that has vocational-advancement value. This does 
not necessarily 
mean that such teachers will favor vocational education, 
as contrasted with liberal education, but they are likely to favor 
an approach to liberal education which has a maximal vocational-advancement 
value, as against a kind of "pure" liberal education that 
is not designed to help people get better jobs.   There is no doubt 
that higher education since World War /2, has moved away from 
"pure" liberal education toward greater emphasis on technology and 
specialization. There are several causes for this, one being rapid economic 
development with increasing numbers of middle-class positions 
requiring engineering or scientific training. But another cause may 
lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty members with their 
own use of education as a means of social advancement.   Compared 
with the college and university faculty members of the period from 
1900 to 1930, the new postwar faculty members consist of more children 
of immigrants and more children 
of urban working-class fathers. Their experience is quite in contrast 
with that of children of upper- and upper-middle-class native-born 
parents, who are more likely to regard education as good for its own 
sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum. 

#THE 
"PUBLIC INTEREST" GROUPS#

Educational policies are formed by 
several groups who are officially or unofficially appointed to act in 
the public interest. Legislators are one such group, and state legislators 
have major responsibility for educational legislation. They generally 
vote so as to serve their own constituency, and if the constituency 
should be solidly middle class or solidly lower class, they might 
be expected to vote and work for middle- or for lower-class interests 
in education. However, there are relatively few such political constituencies, 
and, as has been pointed out, there is seldom a clear-cut distinction 
between the educational interests of one social class and those 
of another.   Another public interest group is the commission 
of laymen or educators which is appointed to study an educational problem 
and to make recommendations. Generally these commissions work 
earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society, as they conceive 
it. Nevertheless, their conclusions and recommendations cannot 
please everybody, and they often represent a particular economic or political 
point of view. For instance, there have been two Presidential 
Commissions on higher education since World War /2,. President 
Truman's Commission on Higher Education tended to take a liberal, 
expansionist position, while President Eisenhower's Committee 
on Education Beyond the High School was slightly more conservative. 
Both Commissions consisted of upper-middle- and upper-class people, 
who attempted to act in the public interest.   An example of a 
more definite class bias is noted in proceedings of the Commission on 
the Financing of Higher Education sponsored by the Association of 
American Universities and supported by the Rockefeller Foundation 
and the Carnegie Corporation. This Commission recommended against 
the use of federal government funds for the assistance of private universities 
and against a broad program of government-supported scholarships. 
This might be said to be an upper- or an upper-middle-class bias, 
but the Commission published as one of its staff studies a book by 
Byron S& Hollingshead entitled <Who Should Go to College?> 
which recommended a federal government scholarship program. Furthermore, 
the Commission set up the Council for Financial Aid to Education 
as a means of encouraging private business to increase its support 
of private higher education. Thus, the Commission acted with a 
sense of social responsibility within the area of its own convictions 
about the problem of government support to private education.   Then 
there are the trustees and officers of the great educational foundations, 
who inevitably exert an influence on educational decisions by 
their support or refusal to support various educational programs, experiments, 
and demonstrations. These people are practically always upper- 
or upper-middle-class persons, who attempt to act in what they regard 
as the interest of the entire society.   Finally there are 
the parent organizations and the laymen's organizations such as the 
National Association of Parents and Teachers, and the Citizens Committee 
on Public Schools. These have an upper-middle-class leadership 
and a middle-class membership, with rare exceptions, where working-class 
parents are active in local P&-T&A& matters. Like 
the 
other policy-making groups, these are middle class in their educational 
attitudes, and they attempt to act in the general public interest,
