{AS A MORAL SHOCKER} 
it is a dud. But this doesn't detract from its merit as an 
interesting, if not great, film. The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker 
summed it up neatly:   "This is a long picture and a controversial 
one, but basically it is a moral, enthralling and heartbreaking 
description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps 
Rome has from her traditional political, cultural and religious 
glories".   <And when they sell it to television in a couple 
of years, it can be shown without editing>. #@#

THE WEEK WENT along briskly enough. I bought a new little 
foreign bomb. It is a British bomb. Very austere yet racy.

It is very chic to drive foreign cars. With a foreign car you must 
wear a cap- it has a leather band in the back. You must also wear 
a car coat.   The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive. 
But we couldn't really get along without it. #@#

"WHERE 
DO YOU put the lighter fluid, ha, ha"? asked the gas station 
man. The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor.

Gas station people are very debonair about small cars. 
When I drove a car with tail fins, I had plenty status at the wind-and-water 
oases. My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth.

This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.   When 
I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome, the 
gas people were happy to see me.   "<Tires> OK? <Check 
the oil and water, sir?>"   They polished the windshield. 
They had a loving touch. #@#

THE MAN STUCK the nozzle 
in the gas tank. "What kind of car is it"? he asked gloomily.

"It is a British Austin, the smallest they make". 
"Get much mileage"?   "About 35".   The gas station 
man sighed unhappily.   "What I always say is what if 
somebody clobbers you in a little car like that? Crunch, that's all 
she wrote".   "I will die rich".   "That will be 
$1.80", said the gas station man. "The windshield looks pretty 
clean". #@#

AH, THE FAIR-WEATHER friends of yesteryear! 
When I wheeled about, finned fore and aft, I was the darling of the 
doormen. Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps 
politely.   With a small bomb, I tuck it between Cadillacs. 
(The last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself. High 
blood pressure can get the best of any of us.)

AT LAST the White House is going to get some much-copied 
furniture by that master American craftsman, Duncan Phyfe, whose 
designs were snubbed in his lifetime when the U& S& Presidents 
of the 19th Century sent abroad for their furnishings.   The American 
Institute of Decorators has acquired a rare complete set of 
sofas 
and chairs which are to be placed in the Executive Mansion's library. 
The suite has been in the same family since the early 1800's. 
The gift is being presented by "heirs and descendants of the Rutherford 
family of New Jersey, whose famous estate, 
"Tranquility", 
was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover, N& J&.

Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon, 
although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned 
after the style trends he set 150 years ago. This acquisition is 
a 
matched, perfect set- consisting of two sofas six feet long, plus six 
sidechairs and two armchairs.   THE ~AID HAS undertaken 
the redecoration of the White House library as a project in 
connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's 
Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential 
home. It is the ~AID's intention to create in the 
library "a miniature museum of Americana" before completed refurbishing 
is unveiled early this fall.   The room will also feature 
another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the 
Duncan Phyfe furniture. The ~AID has found a mantlepiece attributed 
to Samuel McIntyre of Salem, Mass&, an architect and woodcarver 
who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792.

The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and 
is being fitted over the White House library fireplace. It will be 
painted to match the paneling in the room.   The ~AID committee's 
chairman in charge of the redecoration, Mrs& Henry Francis 
Lenygon, was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff 
members on the project. Mrs& Lenygon's committee associates, 
announced formally yesterday by the ~AID in New York, include Mrs& 
Allen Lehman McCluskey and Stephen J& Jussel, both wellknown 
Manhattan decorators. Regional representatives appointed to serve 
from each section of the country include Frank E& Barnes of 
Boston.

PRESIDENT KENNEDY couldn't stay away from his desk for 
the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn 
yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard, 
N& C&. But he left the doors to his office open so he 
could hear the music.   At 4 p& m& the President left the White 
House to welcome the young musicians, students from the ages of 
12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp, 
and to greet the 325 crippled, cardiac and blind children from the 
District area who were special guests at the concert.   It was 
the first in the series of "Concerts for Young People by Young 
People" to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the 
White House. She was not present yesterday, however, to enjoy the 
music or watch the faces of the delighted audience.   She is vacationing 
at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port, Mass&, and in 
his welcoming remarks, the President said he was representing her.

As he approached the open bandstand, erected facing the South 
entrance to the Executive Mansion, the band struck up the "Star Spangled 
Banner" and followed it with "Hail to the Chief".

"I think they played Hail to the Chief better than the Marine 
Corps Band, and we are grateful to them", President Kennedy remarked 
after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor 
James Christian Pfohl.   AFTER PAYING tribute to the conductor 
and his white-clad youthful students, President Kennedy said, 
"As an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that 
is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States- 
schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested 
young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music".

He added "**h I think that sometimes in this country 
we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that 
is being done in this field".   Displaying his knowledge of 
music, the New England-born President remarked that "probably the 
best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans- 
and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary 
musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated all across 
the United States.   "This is a great national cultural asset, 
and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing 
as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today at the 
White House".   As he left the bandstand to return to his office, 
the slender, sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to 
shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming 
the first row under the field tent set up for the guests.   He 
expressed surprise to learn that pretty, blonde Patricia Holbrook, 16, 
of Mount Rainier, 
had attended the Joseph P& Kennedy School 
for the Handicapped in Boston. "The nuns there do a wonderful work", 
the President commented. Patricia now attends the C& Melvin 
Sharpe Health School in the District.   Each of the children 
invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red, white and 
blue ribbon. They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during 
the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White 
House staff.   MANY of the music-loving members of the President's 
staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the 
rapt attention given by the young seated audience. And it turned out 
to be more of a family affair than expected. Henry Hall Wilson, a 
student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's 
staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives, turned 
guest conductor for a Sousa march, the "Stars and Stripes Forever".

Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs& 
Kennedy's Social Secretary, Letitia Baldrige, told about 
plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony 
Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring.   He said he contacted 
a friend, Henry Hall Wilson, on the President's staff and 
asked whether his orchestra could play, in the series. A flow of correspondence 
between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation 
to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert.

ONE OF THE MOST interested "students" on the tour which 
the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following 
their concert at the White House, was Letitia Baldrige, social 
secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.   "I was an art 
major in college", Miss Baldrige explained. "I've been here 
so many times I couldn't count them". She turned out to be a fan, 
too, of Margaret Bouton, the Gallery's associate curator of education.

Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went 
on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 
p& m&. 
The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p& m&, remaining 
for about 45 minutes.   The Brevard visitors had very little 
to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later. They decided 
that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look "sad"**h 
they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's
