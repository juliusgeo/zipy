by day-after-day allegations in memos, written charges of serious consequence 
**h.   "This is a distressing thing. Supposing you or 
I were being accused in this manner, and yet we were doing our level 
best to carry on our work. No organization can carry on like that.

"I've been in government and I can tell some pretty hairy 
stories 
about personnel difficulties, so I know what a problem he was".

"What I'd like you to comment on is the criticism leveled 
at your Committee".   "What do you mean"? 
"For instance, regarding the fact that the Gross Committee issued 
two interim announcements to the press during its investigation. You 
know Bang-Jensen was told the Committee was 'to convey its views, 
suggestions and recommendations to the Secretary General'. In his 
own words, Bang-Jensen 'took it for granted that the Group would 
report to the Secretary General privately and not in public'. He 
claimed that the release of the preliminary findings was 'prejudicial 
to his position'".   Gross bristled. For an instant he 
glared speechless at Marshall. "Listen", he said. "I thought 
the entire report was going to be confidential from beginning to end. 
But you know Bang-Jensen launched an active campaign against us in 
the press. It was getting so that we, the Committee, were being tried. 
You can find it in the papers".   "Well, as a matter of 
fact, I've looked through back-issue files of New York papers for 
December, 1957, and haven't found a great deal"-   Gross 
shot another look at Marshall. "It wasn't necessarily all here 
in New York. Don't forget the foreign press".   "Then 
what about the second interim public announcement? This cited Bang-Jensen's 
'aberrant conduct'".   "The reason for that 
report was to settle the matter of the list. As far as I'm concerned, 
it was a separate matter from the general Committee study of Bang-Jensen's 
conduct. The January fifteen report recommended that 
Bang-Jensen be instructed to burn the list- the papers- in the presence 
of a U&N& Security Officer".   "How about your 
press conference three days later- what was the reason for that? 
Bang-Jensen said you told correspondents that you had checked in advance 
to make sure the term 'aberrant conduct' was not libelous. 
He claimed you made other slanderous allegations".   Gross paused 
and repeated himself. "The entire object of the press conference 
was to clarify the problem of the list, since many in the press were 
querying the U&N& about it. What was the list? I don't know. 
Bang-Jensen never explained what the documents or papers were that 
he had in his possession.   "It was foolish of him to keep 
them, whatever they were. He could have been blackmailed, or his family 
might have been threatened. Of course the matter caught the public's 
attention. We attempted to conclude this, and did so by having 
the papers burned.   Hammerskjold didn't like the way it was 
carried out. It was a sort of Go^tterda^mmerung affair. Hammarskjold 
believes the U&N& is an organization that settles matters 
in a procedural way **h".   Peter Marshall reflected. If Hammarskjold 
had not wanted the list disposed of in this manner, and if 
Bang-Jensen had not wanted it- who had ordered it?   "Mr& 
Gross, concerning the formation of your Committee, there's the 
fact that you have been a legal adviser to the U&N& in the past; 
as I understand it, Mr& Hammarskjold wanted <outside> advice. 
Could you comment on that"?   "I've served as a counsel 
for the U&N& for some years, specializing particularly in real 
estate matters or other problems that the regular U&N& legal 
staff might not be equipped to handle. Mr& Stavropoulos is the U&N& 
legal chief and a very good man, but he is not fully versed on 
some technical points of American law".   "What did you think 
about Bang-Jensen's contention of errors and omissions in the 
Hungarian report"? Marshall asked.   "Those"! Gross 
answered. "Why, Mick Shann went over and over the report with Alsing 
Andersen, trying to check them out. Even after the incident between 
Bang-Jensen and Shann in the Delegates' Lounge **h and this 
was not the way the <Chicago Tribune> presented it".   Gross 
reached in his desk and pulled out two newspaper clippings. One 
was an article on the U&N& by Alice Widener from the <Cincinnati 
Enquirer>. The other was by Chesly Manley in the <Chicago 
Daily Tribune>.   Gross pointed to the Manley story. "I 
know Ches, he's a friend of mine. He probably didn't mean to write 
it this way, or maybe he did. There wasn't any 'violent argument' 
between Bang-Jensen and Shann, as the <Tribune> puts it. That 
implies that Shann was on the enemy side. You see what I mean? 
How it's phrased there- the word 'violent'.   "The 
case was that Bang-Jensen came up to Shann claiming he had found further 
errors in the report. 'I've found errors and I want you to 
look them over'. So once again Shann had to argue with him about 
this. But it wasn't a violent discussion. And after all this, Shann 
went over all that Bang-Jensen had brought up".   (Shann's 
own report, Peter Marshall reflected, describes the encounter as 
"immoderate". Bang-Jensen was in "hysterical condition".)

Gross stopped briefly, then went on. "Shann was responsible 
for the report. He has felt terrible about all this. It was a good 
report, he did all he could to make it a good report. When I speak 
of how Shann felt, I know well. Don't forget, I am an old member 
of the club, a former delegate. I think you are being unfair to take 
these things up now.   "You know, this hits in many areas. It 
appeals to those who were frustrated in the outcome of the Hungarian 
situation. Don't forget, the U&N& did no more than the United 
States did **h it takes a great deal of sophisticated thought to 
get the impact of this fact". 

#CHAPTER 22#

FROM THE HOME 
of his friend, Henrik Kauffmann, in Washington, D&C&, Paul 
Bang-Jensen sent a telegram dated December 9, 1957, to Ernest Gross. 
It said in part:   "**h the matters to be considered are 
obviously of a grave character, and I therefore respectfully request 
that the hearing be postponed for two weeks in order that I might make 
adequate preparation".   Ernest Gross replied the next day, 
putting the suspended diplomat's fears to rest. "This reveals some 
misunderstanding on your part. The group conducting the review is 
not holding formal hearings. It wished to pursue, in the course of this 
review, questions arising from the body of material already in its 
possession **h".   It sounded like a fair enough invitation, 
Peter Marshall reflected, and Bang-Jensen must have thought so too, 
because on the thirteenth, he met the group of three on the thirty-sixth 
floor of the U&N&. There, Ernest Gross further assured him:

"We were requested by the Secretary General, as I understand 
it, to discuss with you such matters as appear to us to be relevant, 
and we are not of course either a formal group or a committee 
in the sense of being guided by any rules or regulations of the Secretariat. 
<The only rules which I think we shall follow will be those 
of common sense, justice, and fairness">.   Peter Marshall 
noted that Bang-Jensen had later referred to his two interviews with 
the Gross group as "unfortunate experiences", and after his second 
meeting on the sixteenth the Dane refused to attend further hearings 
without legal counsel. Marshall pondered the reason for this, and 
pondered too the replacement of one member of the three-man group.

J& A& C& Robertson, after serving Gross one week, left 
for England. 
Fortunately the hole was found at last and plugged. Another week passed 
and even the missionaries were enjoying the voyage. The sickness 
was gone and, after all, the two young couples were on their honeymoon.

The only lasting difficulty was the food. In spite of Pickering 
Dodge's explicit instructions regarding variation of meals, the 
food did not seem the same as at home. "Everything tasted differently 
from what it does on land and those things I was most fond of at 
home, I loathed the most here", Ann noted. At last they concluded 
that the heavy, full feeling in their stomachs was due to lack of exercise. 
Walking was the remedy, they decided, but a deck full of chicken 
coops and pigpens was hardly suitable. Skipping was the alternative. 
A rope was found and, like children in school, the missionaries 
skipped for hours at a time. Finally, tiring of so monotonous a form 
of exercise, they decided to dance instead. It was much more fun, reminding 
the girls of their old carefree days in the Hasseltine frolics 
room at Bradford. The weather turned warmer and with it came better 
appetites, although Harriet was still a little off-color. She could 
not face coffee or tea without milk, and was always craving types of 
food that were not available aboard a sailing ship. By now she was sure 
she was going to have a baby, deciding it would be born in India 
or Burma that November. She was more excited than frightened at the 
prospect of having her first child in a foreign land.   The crew 
of the <Caravan> never failed to amaze Ann, who during her stay 
in Salem must frequently have overheard strong sailorly language. She 
wrote in her journal, "I have not heard the least profane language 
since I have been on board the vessel. This is very uncommon".

She was now enjoying the voyage very much. Even the first wave 
of homesickness had passed, although there were moments when Captain 
Heard pointed out on his compass the direction of Bradford that she 
felt a little twinge at her heart. As for Adoniram, she found him 
to be "the kindest" of husbands.   On Sundays, with the permission 
of Captain Heard, who usually attended with two of his officers, 
services were held in the double cabin. Sometimes a ship would be 
sighted and the <Caravan> pass so close that people could easily 
be seen on the distant deck. Captain Heard did not communicate with 
any strange vessels because of the possibility of war between the United 
States and Britain. As warmer temperatures were encountered Ann 
and Harriet were introduced to the pleasures of bathing daily in salt 
water.   When May came the <Caravan> had already crossed 
the Equator. They were sailing round the Cape of Good Hope; the 
weather had turned wet and cold. At this time Harriet wrote in a letter 
which after their finally landing in India was sent to her mother:

"I care not how soon we reach Calcutta, and are placed 
in a still room, with a bowl of milk and a loaf of Indian bread. I 
can hardly think of this simple fare without exclaiming, oh, what a luxury. 
I have been so weary of the excessive rocking of the vessel, and 
the almost intolerable smell after the rain, that I have done little 
more than lounge on the bed for several days. But I have been blest 
with excellent spirits, and to-day have been running about the deck, 
and <dancing> in our room for <exercise>, as well as ever".

While studying at the seminary in Andover, Adoniram had been working 
on a New Testament translation from the original Greek. He 
had brought it along to continue during the voyage. There was one particular 
word that troubled his conscience. This was the Greek word most 
often translated as "baptism".   Born a Congregationalist, 
he had been baptized as a tiny baby in the usual manner by having 
a few drops of water sprinkled on his head, yet nowhere in the whole of 
the New Testament could he find a description of anybody being baptized 
by sprinkling. John the Baptist used total immersion in the River 
Jordan for believers; even Christ was baptized by this method. 
The more Adoniram 
looked at the Greek word for baptism, the more unhappy 
he became over its true meaning.   As was only natural he 
confided his searchings to Ann, conceding ruefully that it certainly 
looked as if their own 
Congregationalists were wrong and the Baptists right.

Ann was very troubled. By this time she had learned that
