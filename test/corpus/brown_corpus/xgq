yet a while longer. Prosperity is a worthy objective; but if providing 
higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient 
guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and 
denials will have to be made. It may be, of course, that such objectives 
can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism; 
my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be 
resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant 
world- the absence of Soviet Communist power. 

#THE USES OF 
POWER#

This much having been said, the question remains whether we 
have the resources for the job we have to do- defeat Communism- 
and, if so, how those resources ought to be used. This brings us squarely 
to the problem of <power,> and the uses a nation makes of power. 
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that 
it always has been, that it always will be. And I suggest further 
that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of 
American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership 
in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously. 
In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting 
the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them 
into proper focus. One was demonstrably false; the other, for the 
most part, true.   The first was that America had become- or 
was in danger of becoming- a second-rate military power. I know I 
do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention. You 
may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment- 
I certainly do- but you know any comparison of over-all American 
strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States 
not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the 
development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent 
feature of U&S&-Soviet relations for the foreseeable future.

I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority 
on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr& Jameson 
Campaigne has done it well in his new book <American Might and Soviet 
Myth>. Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we 
were in the Soviets' position: "There would be more than 2,000 
modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases 
in Mexico and the Caribbean. Overwhelming Russian naval power would 
always be within a few hundred miles of our coast. Half of the population 
of the U&S& would be needed to work on arms just to feed 
the people". Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where 
oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity. 
Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would 
severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the 
missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.   If 
we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's 
nightmarish worries- or, at least, of the worries he might have if 
his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage. 

#U&S& "PRESTIGE"# 

The other charge was that America's political position 
in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years. The 
contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it 
ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to 
see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.

The argument was typically advanced in terms of U&S& "prestige". 
Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem; and 
even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading. Prestige 
is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill. But contrary 
to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important 
for its own sake. Only the vain and incurably sentimental among 
us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed 
by our strength as they ought to be. The thing to lose sleep over 
is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are 
likely to do about it.   The evidence suggests that foreign peoples 
believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and 
is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead. This ignorant 
estimate, I repeat, is not of any interest in itself; but it becomes 
very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically 
do- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be 
the winning side. To the extent, then, that declining U&S& prestige 
means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on 
an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet 
intimidation, there is reason for concern.   Still, these guesses 
about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the 
actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves. Here 
I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and 
overwhelming but of political power- of influence, if you will- 
about which the relevant questions are: Is Soviet influence throughout 
the world greater or less than it was ten years ago? And is Western 
influence greater or less than it used to be? 

#COMMUNIST GAINS# 

In answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether 
Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy 
before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform 
are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded: 
the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend 
on such spectacular and definitive conquests. Success may mean merely 
the displacement of Western influence.   Communist political 
warfare, we must remember, is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages. 
Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they 
could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where 
the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant- in backwoods guerrilla 
skirmishes, 
in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine 
meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, 
on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences- preferably at 
the highest level.   The Soviets understand, moreover, that the 
first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against 
the West. Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover 
is to "neutralize" a country. The second stage is to retain the 
nominal classification of "neutralist", while in fact turning the 
country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy. And 
this may be as far as the process will go. The Kremlin's goal is 
the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States- 
and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade 
under a "neutralist" mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries 
of the Soviet Foreign Office.   To recite the particulars of 
recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring.   Six years ago 
French Indochina, though in troubie, was in the Western camp. Today 
Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist; Laos is teetering between 
Communism and pro-Communist neutralism; Cambodia is, for all 
practical purposes, neutralist.   Indonesia, in the early days of 
the Republic, leaned toward the West. Today Sukarno's government 
is heavily besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its "neutralist" 
pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.   Ceylon 
has moved from a pro-Western orientation to a neutralism openly 
hostile to the West.   In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and 
Egypt were, a short while ago, in the Western camp. Today the Nasser 
and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent 
for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel; 
in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.

A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve. Never 
mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination: 
the point is that in the struggle for the world that 
vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West. Today, 
Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging, 
it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.   Latin America was once 
an area as "safe" for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon. Today 
it is up for grabs. One Latin American country, Cuba, has become 
a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast. In some countries 
the trend has gone further than others: Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela 
are displaying open sympathy for Castroism, and there is no country- 
save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently 
arranged- where Castroism and anti-Americanism does not prevent 
the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause.

Only in Europe have our lines remained firm- and there only on the 
surface. The strains of neutralism are running strong, notably in 
England, and even in Germany. 

#OPPORTUNITIES MISSED#

What have 
we to show by way of counter-successes? We have had opportunities- 
clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron 
Curtain. There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised 
and mourned, but did nothing about. There was the Polish Revolution 
which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable 
to Soviet interests. There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended 
did not exist. Only in one instance have we moved purposively 
and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power: in Guatemala. 
And contrary to what has been said recently, we did not wait for "outside 
pressures" and "world opinion" to bring down that Communist 
government; we moved decisively to effect an anti-Communist 
<coup 
d'etat>. We served our national interests, and by so doing we 
saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.

THE FIRST RATTLE of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening, 
roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.   "Sounds 
exactly like last time". The young man spoke steadily enough, 
but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven. The middle-aged man 
said over and over, "Why did I come here, why did I come 
here". 
Then he was sick. Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons, 
I heard the thumping of mortars. Then the lights went out.

This was my 
second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of 
Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave. Where was my flashlight? 
Where should I go? To my room? Better stay in the hotel lobby, 
where the walls looked good and thick.   Chinese and Indian 
merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters. Hotel 
attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby. A woman with a small 
boy slipped in between them. "Please", she said, "please". 
She held out her hand to show that she had money.   The American 
newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office. But what 
was the story? Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this 
far? Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane?   "Let's 
play hero", I said. "Let's go to the roof and see". 

#GUNFIRE 
SAVES THE MOON#

By 7:50 the answer was plain. There had 
been an eclipse of the moon. A traditional Lao explanation is that 
the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all 
possible noise, ideally with firearms.   The din was successful, 
too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had 
begun 
to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.   How
