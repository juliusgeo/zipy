and I carried you in. I gave you a drink and then you went to sleep".

"Oh". She stared at him, her eyes wide as she thought 
about what he had said; then she murmured: "You're very kind, 
Mr& Morgan. Do you take in all the strays who come by"?

"I don't have many strays coming to my front door", he said. 
"Think you can walk to the table"?   "Of course".

She got to her feet, staggered, and almost fell. He caught her 
by an arm and helped her into the kitchen. She sat down at the table, 
shaking her head. "I'm sorry, Mr& Morgan. I'm usually a 
very strong woman, but I'm awfully tired".   "And hungry", 
he said. "Start in. It's not much of a meal, but it's what 
I eat".   "Not much of a meal"? the girl cried. "Mr& 
Morgan, it's the best-looking food I ever saw".   He 
told himself he had never seen two people eat so much. When they were 
finally satisfied, Jones said, "I think he's going to give us work".

The grateful way she looked at Morgan made him ashamed 
of himself. When he saw the expression in her eyes, he knew he couldn't 
send them on. She said, "I guess the Lord looks out for fools, 
drunkards, and innocents".   Morgan laughed. "Which are 
you"?   "We're not drunkards", she said. "That's 
all I'm sure of".   She helped him with the dishes, then 
he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark. He carried 
the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the 
wall. He said: "You'll feel a lot better after you have a bath. 
Your feet are in bad shape, Mrs& Jones. You'll have to go to 
town to see the doc".   "No, she'll be all right", Jones 
said quickly. "I mean, we don't have any way to get there and 
we can't expect you to quit work just to take us to town". 
"We'll see", Morgan said.   "Could you find me a needle 
and thread"? the girl asked. "My dress needs some work on it".

He nodded and, going into the bedroom, brought a needle, 
thread, and scissors. He said: "I'm going to bed". He nodded 
at the door in front of him. "That's my spare bedroom. The bed 
isn't made, but you'll find plenty of blankets there".   "You're 
awfully kind", the girl said. "We'll pay you back if 
you'll let us. Some way".   "It's all right", he said. 
"I get up early. You'd better sleep".   Jones followed 
him into the front room, closing the door behind him. He said: "If 
it's all right with you, Mr& Morgan, I'll sleep out here 
on the couch. We haven't slept together since we started. I just 
can't take any chances on getting her pregnant, and if we were sleeping 
together **h"   He stopped, embarrassed, and Morgan said, 
"I understand that, but I don't savvy why you'd go off and leave 
your jobs in the first place".   "We got fired", Jones 
said. "We had to do something".   They were a pair of lost, 
whipped kids, Morgan thought as he went to bed.

Gavin paused wearily. "You can't stay here with me. It's 
late and you said they'd be here by dawn".   "You can't 
make me go".   Gavin sank down again into his chair and began 
to rock. He was thinking of Rittenhouse and how he had left him 
there, to rock to death on the porch of the Splendide. It was the only 
thing in his life for which he felt guilt. Beneath his black shirt 
his frail shoulders shook and croaks of pain broke from his throat, the 
stored pain shattering free in slow gasps, terrible to see. Clayton 
tried to call back the face of the man he had known. Against that other 
man he could rally his anger; against this bent man in the chair 
he was powerless.   Gavin's lips moved so that Clayton had 
to stoop to catch the words. "Do you remember Big Charlie"? he 
whispered. "He stuck with me all these years. Just a half-breed 
'pache, never said much, never meant anythin to me, but he stuck with 
me. He got into a fight with Tom English, your brother's son. 
It was a fair fight, the boy provoked it- Big Charlie told me so. 
I believed him. They killed Big Charlie, dumped his body in my rose 
garden two nights ago. My men, they all left me. Just cleared out. 
I didn't understand why, Clay. They just all cleared out. I treated 
them fair **h"

He wiped his lips with a sleeve, then stared 
at Clayton in a childish kind of wonder. "Do you mean"- he 
asked almost shyly- "you want me to go with you, wherever you're 
goin"?   "Yes".   "You don't hate me any more"?

Clayton choked, shook his head, murmuring, "No".

"Come here". The old man beckoned with one finger and Clayton 
went forward to him. Gavin slipped his arms around his chest and 
hugged him fiercely. "All my life", he said, "I tried. I tried. 
I saw you driftin away- but I tried. And you wanted no part 
of me when I had so much to give. Now there's nothin left of me. 
Laurel is gone, my men are gone, Ed is dead- and you come to me, to 
help me. Oh! God in Heaven, I can't refuse you now. That would 
mock me too much! Can't let you go way from me again **h" He 
closed his eyes, ashamed of his tears.   "I'll go, Clay".

Clayton freed himself from the embrace and stepped back. The 
eyes followed him fearfully. "The horses. There isn't much time. 
I'll saddle the horses and bring them round. You get ready".

He burst from the hot confinement of the room into the cold 
night air. Gavin's stallion was in the barn and he tightened the cinches 
over the saddle blanket, working by touch in the darkness, comforting 
the animal with easy words. When he had finished he led him and 
the mare to the porch. The stallion had smelled the mare coming into 
heat and began to paw the turf, shaking his head. Clayton looped the 
reins in a 
knot over the veranda post and patted the warm flesh of his 
neck. The mare had backed away. "You take it easy, boy", Clayton 
whispered. "She doesn't want you now. You take it easy, your time 
will come".   Gavin stood on the porch, a thin figure. He 
had taken a carbine down from the wall and it trailed from his hand, 
the stock bumping on the wood floor. Clayton called to him and he came 
slowly down the steps.   "Clay", he said, "where are we 
goin"?   "To a ranch in the valley. There's someone there 
I have to see. We may take her with us- to California. I don't 
know yet, it's crazy; I have to think about it. But California 
is where we're goin".   "California". Gavin began to 
nod. "That's a new land. A man could make a mark there. two men, 
together like us, we could do somethin fine out there, maybe find a 
place where no one's ever been. Start out fresh, the two of us, like 
nothin had ever happened".   "Yes, like a father and son".

"I made you what you are", Gavin whispered. "I made 
you so you could stand up. I made you a man".   "Yes, Gavin, 
you did".   He approached the horse and laid a hand on the 
stallion's quivering neck. "Help me up, Clay. Help me up, I 
feel kind of stiff". Clayton lifted him gently into the saddle, like 
a child. "I hate to leave my garden", Gavin said. "They'll 
trample it down. I loved my garden".   "It will grow again- 
in California".   "I loved this valley", he whispered 
huskily. 
"Lived alone here for three years, before any man came. Lived 
alone by the river. It was nice then, so peaceful and quiet. There 
was no one but me. I don't want to leave it".   Clayton 
swung into the saddle and whacked the stallion's rump. The two horses 
broke from the yard, from the circle of light cast by the lamp still 
burning in the house, into the darkness. 

#THIRTY-FIVE#

THEY 
RODE at a measured pace through the valley. Dawn would come soon 
and the night was at its coldest. The moon had sunk below the black crest 
of the mountains and the land, seen through eyes that had grown accustomed 
to the absence of light, looked primeval, as if no man had ever 
trespassed before. It looked as Gavin had first seen it years ago, 
on those nights when he slept alone by his campfire and waked suddenly 
to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon's 
wind- a savage land, untenanted and brooding, too strong to be 
broken by the will of men. Gavin sighed bitterly. In that inert landscape 
the caravan of his desires passed before his mind. He saw them 
ambushed, strewn in the postures of the broken and the dying. In vain 
his mind groped to reassemble the bones of the relationships he had 
sought so desperately, but they would not come to life. The silence oppressed 
him, made him bend low over the horse's neck as if to hide 
from a wind that had begun to blow far away and was twisting slowly through 
the darkness in its slow search.   They passed ranches that 
were framed dark gray against the black hills. Then at last the darkness 
began to dissolve. A bold line of violet broke loose from the 
high ridge of the mountains, followed by feathers of red that swept the 
last stars from the sky. The wan light spread over the ground and the 
valley revealed in the first glimmer the contours of trees and fences 
and palely shadowed gullies. ##

THEY HAD been seen as soon 
as they left the ranch, picked out of the darkness by the weary though 
watchful eyes of two men posted a few hundred yards away in the windless 
shelter of the trees. The two men whipped their horses into town 
and flung themselves up the steps of the saloon, crying their intelligence.

The men in Pettigrew's were tired from a night's 
drinking, their faces red and baggy. But the liquor had flushed their 
courage. They greeted the news angrily, as though they had been cheated 
of purpose. Lester heard their muttering, saw their eyes reveal their 
desire. He worked his tongue round and round in the hollow of his 
cheek and his voice came out of his throat, dry and cracked. "He's 
leavin. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Clayton is with 
him, takin him out of the valley. You can't"-   "Keep out 
of this", Purvis snarled. "He's not your brother, he's Gavin's 
son. 
You see, he lied to us when he said he was leavin alone".

Joe Purvis was thinking back many years. First he thought of 
the time he had ridden to Gavin and told him how his cattle were being 
rustled at the far end of the valley. He remembered Gavin's smirk, 
his own cringing feeling, his impotence. Then he thought of a time 
when Clayton's horse had fallen lame in the Gap. His wife had 
said to him: "Nellie is in love with Clayton Roy. He wouldn't 
even dance with her at Gavin's party. He treats her like she was 
dirt. And you stand by like a fool and let him do it **h"   He 
remembered Clayton's mocking smile in the saloon when he had asked 
him what he would do if they brought their cattle to water. It was 
the night Clayton had tricked them in the poker game. "You're Gavin's 
son", Joe Purvis had said.   He turned to Lester. 
"You brought him back to this valley thinkin he would help you find 
your boy. He meant to help Gavin all the time. He made a fool of 
you, Lester". He swung round to the other men- "We can catch 
him easy! There are plenty of fresh horses halfway at my place. If 
we let them go, they won't stay away, they'll find men to ride with 
them and they'll be back. There's only one way they can get out 
now and that's through the Gap- if we ride hard we can take them".

Lester's hand fluttered to Cabot's shoulder. The 
boy jerked away.   "He killed Tom- do you understand that"? 
Cabot turned back to the men and he was drunk with the thing they
