time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation 
of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation. The section 
is violated whether or not actual restraints or monopolies, or the substantial 
lessening of competition, have occurred or are intended **h". 
353 U& S&, at 589.   Thus, a finding of conspiracy to 
restrain trade or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court's 
decision. Indeed, as already noted, the Court proceeded on the assumption 
that the executives involved in the dealings between du Pont 
and General Motors acted "honorably and fairly" and exercised 
their business judgment only to serve what they deemed the best interests 
of their own companies. This, however, did not bar finding that du 
Pont had become pre-eminent as a supplier of automotive fabrics and 
finishes to General Motors; that these products constituted a "line 
of commerce" within the meaning of the Clayton Act; that General 
Motors' share of the market for these products was substantial; 
and that competition for this share of the market was endangered 
by the financial relationship between the two concerns: "  The 
statutory policy of fostering free competition is obviously furthered 
when no supplier has an advantage over his competitors from an acquisition 
of his customer's stock likely to have the effects condemned 
by the statute. We repeat, that the test of a violation of @ 7 is 
whether, at the time of suit, there is a reasonable probability that 
the acquisition is likely to result in the condemned restraints. The 
conclusion upon this record is inescapable that such likelihood was proved 
as to this acquisition **h". 353 U& S&, at 607.   On 
the basis of the findings which led to this conclusion, the Court remanded 
the case to the District Court to determine the appropriate 
relief. The sole guidance given the Court for discharging the task committed 
to it was this: "  The judgment must therefore be reversed 
and the cause remanded to the District Court for a determination, 
after further hearing, of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate 
in the public interest to eliminate the effects of the acquisition 
offensive to the statute. The District Courts, in the framing 
of equitable decrees, are clothed 'with large discretion to model 
their judgments to fit the exigencies of the particular case'. <International 
Salt Co&> 
v& <United States,> 332 U& S& 392,

course of the proceedings in the District Court. #/2,.#

This 
Court's judgment was filed in the District Court on July 18, 
1957. The first pretrial conference- held to appoint <amici curiae> 
to represent the interest of the stockholders of du Pont and General 
Motors and to consider the procedure to be followed in the subsequent 
hearings- took place on September 25, 1957. At the outset, the 
Government's spokesman explained that counsel for the Government 
and for du Pont had already held preliminary discussions with a view 
to arriving at a relief plan that both sides could recommend to the court. 
Du Pont, he said, had proposed disenfranchisement of its General 
Motors stock along with other restrictions on the du Pont-General 
Motors relationship. The Government, deeming these suggestions inadequate, 
had urged that any judgment include divestiture of du Pont's 
shares of General Motors. Counsel for the Government invited 
du Pont's views on this proposal before recommending a specific program, 
but stated that if the court desired, or if counsel for du Pont 
thought further discussion would not be profitable, the Government 
was prepared to submit a plan within thirty days.   Counsel for 
du Pont indicated a preference for the submission of detailed plans by 
both sides at an early date. No previous antitrust case, he said, had 
involved interests of such magnitude or presented such complex problems 
of relief. The submission of detailed plans would place the issues 
before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture 
or disenfranchisement in the abstract. The Court adopted this procedure 
with an appropriate time schedule for carrying it out.   The 
Government submitted its proposed decree on October 25, 1957. The 
plan called for divestiture by du Pont of its 63,000,000 shares of General 
Motors stock by equal annual distributions to its stockholders, 
as a dividend, over a period of ten years. Christiana Securities Company 
and Delaware Realty + Investment Company, major stockholders 
in du Pont, and the stockholders of Delaware were dealt with specially 
by provisions requiring the annual sale by a trustee, again over 
a ten-year period, of du Pont's General Motors stock allocable to 
them, as well as any General Motors stock which Christiana and Delaware 
owned outright. If, in the trustee's judgment, "reasonable 
market conditions" did not prevail during any given year, he was to 
be allowed to petition the court for an extension of time within the 
ten-year period. In addition, the right to vote the General Motors 
stock held by du Pont was to be vested in du Pont's stockholders, 
other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware; 
du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring 
stock in or exercising control over General Motors; du Pont, 
Christiana, and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director 
or officer in common with General Motors, and vice versa; and 
General Motors and du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement 
that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified 
percentage of its requirements of any du Pont manufactured product, 
or for the grant of exclusive patent rights, or for a grant by General 
Motors to du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any 
chemical discovery of General Motors, or for the maintenance of any 
joint commercial enterprise by the two companies.   On motion of 
the <amici 
curiae,> the court directed that a ruling be obtained from 
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as to the federal income tax 
consequences of the Government's plan. On May 9, 1958, the Commissioner 
announced his rulings. The annual dividends paid to du Pont 
stockholders in shares of General Motors stock would be taxable as ordinary 
income to the extent of du Pont's earnings and profits. The 
measure, for federal income tax purposes, of the dividend to individual 
stockholders would be the fair market value of the shares at the time 
of each annual distribution. In the case of taxpaying corporate stockholders, 
the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value 
of the shares or du Pont's tax basis for them, which is approximately 
$2.09 per share. The forced sale of the General Motors stock owned 
by or allocable to Christiana, Delaware, and the stockholders of 
Delaware, and deposited with the trustee, would result in a tax to those 
parties at the capital gains rate.   Du Pont's counterproposal 
was filed on May 14, 1958. Under its plan du Pont would retain 
its General Motors shares but be required to pass on to its stockholders 
the right to vote those shares. Christiana and Delaware would, 
in turn, be required to pass on the voting rights to the General Motors 
shares allocable to them to their own stockholders. Du Pont would 
be enjoined from having as a director, officer, or employee anyone 
who was simultaneously an officer or employee of General Motors, and 
no director, officer, or employee of du Pont could serve as a director 
of General Motors without court approval. Du Pont would be denied 
the right to acquire any additional General Motors stock except 
through General Motors' distributions of stock or subscription rights 
to its stockholders.   On June 6, 1958, General Motors submitted 
its objections to the Government's proposal. It argued, <inter 
alia,> that a divestiture order would severely depress the market 
value of the stock of both General Motors and du Pont, with consequent 
serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent 
investors, among them thousands of small trusts and charitable institutions; 
that there would be a similar decline in the market values of 
other automotive and chemical stocks, with similar losses to the stockholders 
of those companies; that the tremendous volume of General 
Motors stock hanging over the market for ten years would hamper the efforts 
of General Motors and other automobile manufacturers to raise 
equity capital; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect 
on the entire stock market and on general business activity. General 
Motors comprehensively contended that the Government plan would 
not be "in the public interest" as required by the mandate of this 
Court.   The decrees proposed by the <amici curiae> were filed 
in August of 1958. These plans, like du Pont's contained provisions 
for passing the vote on du Pont's General Motors shares on 
to the ultimate stockholders of du Pont, Christiana, and Delaware, 
except that officers and directors of the three companies, their spouses, 
and other people living in their households, as well as other specified 
persons, were to be totally disenfranchised. Both plans also prohibited 
common directors, officers, or employees between du Pont, Christiana, 
and Delaware, on the one hand, and General Motors on the 
other. 
It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude "unnourished by sense" 
to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such 
a risk, or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger 
the confidentiality of the marriage relationship. While it is easy 
enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas of the Crown 
from a metaphysical point of view, the concept of the "oneness" 
of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between 
husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be 
regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage. 
By 
making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which 
Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship, the Court today 
continues in the path charted by the recent decision in <Wyatt> 
v& <United States>, 362 U&S& 525, where the Court held that, 
under the circumstances of that case, a wife could be compelled to 
testify against her husband over her objection. One need not waver in 
his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other 
things in American life which are also of great importance, and to which 
even law enforcement must accommodate itself. One of these is the 
solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage. The Court's 
opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine 
does not in fact protect this relationship, and that hence the doctrine 
"enthrone[s] an unreality into a rule of law". I am not 
easily persuaded that a rule accepted by so many people for so many centuries 
can be so lightly dismissed. But in any event, I submit that 
the power to depose belongs to Congress, not to this Court. I dissent. 
Petitioner, who claims to be a conscientious objector, was convicted 
of violating @ 12 (a) of the Universal Military Training and Service 
Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces. He claims 
that he was denied due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment, 
because (1) at a hearing before a hearing officer of the Department 
of Justice, he was not permitted to rebut statements attributed 
to him by the local board, and (2) at the trial, he was denied the right 
to have the hearing officer's report and the original report of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation as to his claim. <Held>: 
On the record in this case, the administrative procedures prescribed 
by the Act were fully complied with; petitioner was not denied due 
process; and his conviction is sustained. Pp& 60-66. _(A)_ Petitioner 
was not denied due process in the administrative proceedings, 
because the statement in question was in his file, to which he had access, 
and he had opportunities to rebut it both before the hearing officer 
of the Department of Justice and before the appeal board. Pp& 
62-63. _(B)_ 
Petitioner was not entitled to have the hearing officer's 
notes and report, especially since he failed to show any particular 
need for them and he did have a copy of the Department of Justice's 
recommendation to the appeal board. Pp& 63-64. _(C)_ 
Petitioner was not entitled, either in the administrative hearing at 
the Department of Justice or at his trial, to inspect the original report 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, since he was furnished 
a resume of it, did not challenge its accuracy, and showed no particular 
need for the original report. Pp& 64-66.   <Haydn C& 
Covington> argued the cause and filed a brief for petitioner.

<Daniel M& Friedman> argued the cause for the United States. 
On the brief were <Solicitor General Rankin, Assistant Attorney 
General Wilkey, Beatrice Rosenberg> and <J& F& Bishop>.
