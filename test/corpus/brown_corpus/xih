progressed, the speed of military vehicles has increased, the range of 
missiles has been extended, the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles 
has been adopted, and the range and breadth of message sending 
has increased. Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision 
making, network structure seems to be paramount, and without monitoring 
no network has value.   On the parade ground the net may be similar 
to that shown in Figure 3. The monitoring is the highest and 
most restrictive of any organization in existence. No questions, statements, 
or explanations are permitted- only commands. Commands go only 
from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank. The same command 
is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to 
corporal. All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and 
terminate with action of the men in the ranks. Even the officer in charge, 
be it a captain (for small display) or a general, is restrained 
by monitoring. This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the 
hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility. 
The commands are specified by the military regulations; are 
few in number, briefly worded, all different in sound; and are combinable 
into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be 
desired on a parade ground. This monitoring is necessary because, on 
a parade ground, everyone can hear <too much>, and without monitoring 
a confused social event would develop.   With troops dispersed 
on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground, it may seem that 
a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines 
of communication. Years ago this was true, but with the replacement 
of wires or runners by radio and radar (and perhaps television), these 
restrictions have disappeared and now again <too much> is heard.

In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even 
in the field, are more formal. In the extreme and oversimplified example 
suggested in Figure 3, the organization is more easily understood 
and more predictable in behavior. A military organization has an objective 
chosen by the higher command. This objective is adhered to throughout 
the duration of the action. The connective system, or network, 
is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore 
not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated 
unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college, 
or a rural village.   The assumptions upon which the example 
shown 
in Figure 3 is based are: (a) One man can direct about six subordinates 
if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not 
need too much personal coaching, indoctrinating, etc&. (b) A message 
runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more 
than about six consecutive times. (c) Decisions of a general kind 
are made by the central command. And (d) all action of a physical kind 
pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower 
rank. These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the 
top, six directly under him, six under each of these, and so on until 
there are six levels of personnel. The number of people acting as one 
body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of **f 55,987 
men.   This organizational network would be of no avail if there 
were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent. Of types 
of message listed in Table 1, commands and statements are the only 
ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3. A further 
regulation is that commands always go <down>, unaccompanied by statements, 
and statements always go <up>, unaccompanied by commands. Questions 
and, particularly, exclamations are usually channeled along informal, 
horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried 
beyond the nearest neighbor.   It will readily be seen that 
in this suggested network (not materially different from some of the 
networks in vogue today) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than 
is usually put into practice. Furthermore, the network in Figure 
3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics 
and the like are interlaced.   Not discussed here are some 
military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare, where the 
surveillance, sending, transmitting, and receiving are all so inadequate 
that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks. Such 
problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much 
like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall 
grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they 
could teach. _A TEAM FOR USEFUL RESEARCH._ This is an unsolved 
problem which probably has never been seriously investigated, although 
one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient <specialists> 
of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss, for example, 
in precision machinery and mathematics, or the Finns in geochemistry. 
We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have 
not enough <generalists> who can see the over-all picture and combine 
our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes. This problem 
of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and 
specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis. Since 
the difficulty of drawing the net is great, we will merely discuss 
it.   First, we realize that a pure specialist does not exist. But, 
for practical purposes, we have people who can be considered as such. 
For example, there are persons who are in physical science, in the 
field of mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only X-rays, 
applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction, to clay 
minerals only, and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating 
on the montmorillonites; or persons in the social sciences in the 
field of anthropology, studying the lung capacity of seven Andean 
Indians. So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more 
about less and less as he develops, as contrasted to the generalist, 
who knows less and less about more and more. 
AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC THOUGHT, pointed up the relation between the 
Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social 
religion, which he called the American Democratic Faith. Those familiar 
with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the 
democratic faith at around 1850. And he describes it as a balanced polarity 
between the notions of the free individual and what he called 
the fundamental law.   I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called 
fundamental law. But first I want to quote him on the relationship 
that he found between religion and politics in this country and 
what happened to it. He points out that from the time of Jackson on 
through World War /1,, evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence 
in the social and political life of America. He terms this 
early enthusiasm "Romantic Christianity" and concludes that its 
similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that "the doctrine 
of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical 
Protestantism". Let me quote him even more fully, for his 
analysis is important to my theme.   He says: "Beside the 
Protestant philosophy of Progress, as expressed in radical or conservative 
millenarianism, should be placed the doctrine of the democratic 
faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United 
States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted 
the beacon of democracy". He specifies, "In the middle period 
of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism, 
in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism. But in 
every period it has been humanism". And let me add, utopianism, also.

Some fourteen or fifteen years ago, in an essay I called 
<The Leader Follows- Where?> I used his polarity to illustrate 
what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call 
Progressivism. It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the 
balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law 
in the common man. That is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been 
so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor 
law any more. It is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never 
seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been 
cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy. And 
with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel 
called Christian supernaturalism. And the common man was developing 
mythic power, or charisma, on his own.   During the decade 
that followed, the common man, as that piece put it, grew uncomfortable 
as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow (Wilson) 
only to learn from Science, to his shocked relief that after all there 
was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow- 
that there was a chemical formula for him, and that too much couldn't 
be expected of him.   The socialism implicit in the slogan 
of the Roosevelt Revolution, freedom from want and fear, seems a 
far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution, 
or of the Jacksonian frontier. What had happened to the common 
man?   French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence 
in this country before the days of Popularism. The riotous onrush 
of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general 
secular drift to the Religion of Humanity, however, prepared 
the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring 
of one sort of another. The first of which to find important place 
in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson. 
Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s, the 
dislocations of the Depression, the common ethos of Materialism everywhere, 
all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced 
Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy 
of the Little People.   However, it is important to trace the 
philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the 
common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence 
of the latter on the former. That John Locke's philosophy of 
the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration 
of Independence, I believe, we generally accept. Yet, after 
Rousseau had given the <social contract> a new twist with his notion 
of the General Will, the same philosophy, it may be said, became 
the idea source of the French Revolution also.   The importance 
of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us, however. This 
notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in 
the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship. And it 
is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle, in his remarkable long 
essay, <The Heresy of Democracy>, and in a more general way by 
Voegelin, in his <New Science of Politics>, that this same Rousseauan 
idea, descending through European democracy, is the source of 
Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is important 
to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves 
in after World War /2, and our great democratic victory 
that brought no peace.   The long road that had taken liberals in 
this country into the social religion of democracy, into a worship of 
man, led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under 
a Socialist State. And the ~USSR existed as the revolutionary 
experiment in radical socialism, the ultimate exemplar. And by the 
time the war ended, liberal leadership in this country was spiritually 
Marxist.   We will recall that the still confident liberals of 
the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in 
San Francisco to set up the legal framework, finally and at last, to 
rationalize war- to rationalize want and fear- out of the world: 
the United Nations. We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace 
and rehabilitation. Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle 
of another fight, an irrational, an indecent, an undeclared and immoral 
war with our strongest (and some had thought noblest) ally.

During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly 
backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal. During 
the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in 
the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative 
policy of Containment- and the bitterest irony- enforced and enforceable 
only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste 
for but could not abandon: the atom bomb. In 1952, it will be remembered, 
the G&O&P& without positive program campaigned on the 
popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly.

All of this, I know, is recent history familiar to you. But 
I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common 
man, to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership.

A perceptive journalist, Sam Lubell, has phrased it in the
