a winter sun as "God-curst".   The details of the setting 
of "Neutral Tones" are not, strictly speaking, metaphorical, but 
they combine to create a mood which is appropriate both to a dismal 
winter day and to the end of love, and in this way love and weather, the 
emotions and the elements, symbolize each other in a way that is common 
to many of Hardy's best poems ("Weathers", "The Darkling 
Thrush", and "During Wind and Rain", for example) and to 
some moving passages in the novels as well (<Far From the Madding 
Crowd> is full of scenes constructed in this way).   "Neutral 
Tones" is an excellent example of Hardy's mature style, drawn 
from his earliest productive period; I cite it as evidence that he 
did not develop through new styles as he grew older (as Yeats did), 
but that he simply learned to use better what he already had. In the 
poem we recognize and acknowledge one man's sense of the world; if 
it is somber, it is also precise, and the precision lends authority to 
the vision. In "Revulsion", on the other hand, the pessimism is 
a case not proven; the poem offers nothing to persuade us of the speaker's 
right to speak as he does. In the 1860-70 decade there are 
many poems like "Revulsion", but there is only one "Neutral Tones". 
Hardy was not Hardy very often.   The "Poems of 1912-13" 
offer a good example of Hardy's style as it was manifested 
in the later productive decade. These are the poems Hardy wrote after 
the death of his first wife; they compose a painful elegy to what 
might have been, to a marriage that began with a promise of happiness, 
and ended in long years of suffering and hatred. Hardy obviously felt 
that these poems were peculiarly personal and private; he sometimes 
called them "an expiation", and he would not allow them to be published 
in periodicals. They are the only poems that he rearranged as 
a group between their first appearance (in <Satires of Circumstance>) 
and the publication of the <Collected Poems>.   The elegiac 
tone is Hardy's natural tone of voice, and it is not surprising 
that the 1912-13 poems are consistently and unmistakably his. The 
view is always toward the past; but the mood is not quite nostalgic- 
Hardy would not allow sentiment to soften his sense of the irredeemable 
pastness of the past, and the eternal deadness of the dead. The 
poems are, the epigraph tells us, the "traces of an ancient flame"; 
the fire of love is dead, and Hardy stands, as the speaker does 
in the last poem of the sequence, over the burnt circle of charred sticks, 
and thinks of past happiness and present grief, honest and uncomforted. 
Critically invisible, modern revolt, like X-rays and radioactivity, 
is perceived only by its effects at more materialistic social levels, 
where 
it is called delinquency.   "Disaffiliation", by the way, 
is the term used by the critic and poet, Lawrence Lipton, who has 
written several articles on this subject, the first of which, in the 
<Nation,> quoted as epigraph, "We disaffiliate **h"- John L& 
Lewis.   Like the pillars of Hercules, like two ruined Titans 
guarding the entrance to one of Dante's circles, stand two 
great dead juvenile delinquents- the heroes of the post-war generation: 
the great saxophonist, Charlie Parker, and Dylan Thomas. If 
the word deliberate means anything, both of them certainly deliberately 
destroyed themselves.   Both of them were overcome by the horror 
of the world in which they found themselves, because at last they 
could no longer overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical 
art. Both of them were my friends. Living in San Francisco I saw 
them seldom enough to see them with a perspective which was not distorted 
by exasperation or fatigue. So as the years passed, I saw them 
each time in the light of an accelerated personal conflagration.

The last time I saw Bird, at Jimbo's Bob City, he was so 
gone- 
so blind to the world- that he literally sat down on me before he 
realized I was there. "What happened, man"? I said, referring 
to the pretentious "Jazz Concert". "Evil, man, evil", he 
said, and that's all he said for the rest of the night. About dawn 
he got up to blow. The rowdy crowd chilled into stillness and the fluent 
melody spiraled through it.   The last time I saw Dylan, 
his self-destruction had not just passed the limits of rationality. It 
had assumed the terrifying inertia of inanimate matter. Being with 
him was like being swept away by a torrent of falling stones. 
Now Dylan Thomas and Charlie Parker have a great deal more in common 
than the same disastrous end. As artists, they were very similar. 
They were both very fluent. But this fluent, enchanting utterance had, 
compared with important artists of the past, relatively little content. 
Neither of them got very far beyond a sort of entranced rapture 
at his own creativity. The principal theme of Thomas's poetry was 
the ambivalence of birth and death- the pain of blood-stained creation. 
Music, of course, is not so explicit an art, but anybody who knew 
Charlie Parker knows that he felt much the same way about his own 
gift. Both of them did communicate one central theme: Against the 
ruin of the world, there is only one defense- the creative act. This, 
of course, is the theme of much art- perhaps most poetry. It is 
the theme of Horace, who certainly otherwise bears little resemblance 
to Parker or Thomas. The difference is that Horace accepted his theme 
with a kind of silken assurance. To Dylan and Bird it was an agony 
and terror. I do not believe that this is due to anything especially 
frightful about their relationship to their own creativity. I believe 
rather that it is due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity 
seemed to be the sole value. Horace's column of imperishable 
verse shines quietly enough in the lucid air of Augustan Rome. Art 
may have been for him the most enduring, orderly, and noble activity 
of man. But the other activities of his life partook of these values. 
They did not actively negate them. Dylan Thomas's verse had to 
find endurance in a world of burning cities and burning Jews. He was 
able to find meaning in his art as long as it was the answer to air 
raids and gas ovens. As the world began to take on the guise of an immense 
air raid or gas oven, I believe his art became meaningless to him. 
I think all this could apply to Parker just as well, although, because 
of the nature of music, it is not demonstrable- at least not 
conclusively.   Thomas and Parker have more in common than theme, 
attitude, life pattern. In the practice of their art, there is an 
obvious technical resemblance. Contrary to popular belief, they were 
not great technical innovators. Their effects are only superficially 
startling. Thomas is a regression from the technical originality and 
ingenuity of writers like Pierre Reverdy or Apollinaire. Similarly, 
the innovations of bop, and of Parker particularly, have been vastly 
overrated by people unfamiliar with music, especially by that ignoramus, 
the intellectual jitterbug, the jazz aficionado. The tonal novelties 
consist in the introduction of a few chords used in classical music 
for centuries. And there is less rhythmic difference between progressive 
jazz, no matter how progressive, and Dixieland, than there is 
between two movements of many conventional symphonies.   What Parker 
and his contemporaries- Gillespie, Davis, Monk, Roach (Tristano 
is an anomaly), etc&- did was to absorb the musical ornamentation 
of the older jazz into the basic structure, of which it then became 
an integral part, and with which it then developed. This is true 
of the melodic line which could be put together from selected passages 
of almost anybody- Benny Carter, Johnny Hodges. It is true of 
the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shifts continuously, or at least 
is continuously sprung, so that it becomes ambiguous enough to allow 
the pattern to be dominated by the long pulsations of the phrase or 
strophe. This is exactly what happened in the transition from baroque 
to rococo music. It is the difference between Bach and Mozart.

It is not a farfetched analogy to say that this is what Thomas 
did to poetry. The special syntactical effects of a Rimbaud or an Edith 
Sitwell- actually ornaments- become the main concern. The metaphysical 
conceits, which fascinate the Reactionary Generation still 
dominant in backwater American colleges, were embroideries. Thomas's 
ellipses and ambiguities are ends in themselves. The immediate 
theme, if it exists, is incidental, and his main theme- the terror of 
birth- is simply reiterated.   This is one difference between 
Bird and Dylan which should be pointed out. Again, contrary to popular 
belief, there is nothing crazy or frantic about Parker either musically 
or emotionally. His sinuous melody is a sort of nai^ve transcendence 
of all experience. Emotionally it does not resemble Berlioz 
or Wagner; it resembles Mozart. This is true also of a painter 
like Jackson Pollock. He may have been eccentric in his behavior, 
but his paintings are as impassive as Persian tiles. Partly this difference 
is due to the nature of verbal communication. The insistent talk-aboutiveness 
of the general environment obtrudes into even the most 
idyllic poetry. It is much more a personal difference. Thomas certainly 
wanted to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world. 
Parker and Pollock wanted to substitute a work of art for the world.

Technique pure and simple, rendition, is not of major importance, 
but it is interesting that Parker, following Lester Young, was 
one of the leaders of the so-called saxophone revolution. In modern 
jazz, the saxophone is treated as a woodwind and played with conventional 
embouchure. Metrically, Thomas's verse was extremely conventional, 
as was, incidentally, the verse of that other tragic enrage, Hart 
Crane.   I want to make clear what I consider the one technical 
development in the first wave of significant post-war arts. Ornament 
is confabulation in the interstices of structure. A poem by Dylan 
Thomas, a saxophone solo by Charles Parker, a painting by Jackson 
Pollock- these are pure confabulations as ends in themselves. Confabulation 
has come to determine structure. Uninhibited lyricism should 
be distinguished from its exact opposite- the sterile, extraneous 
invention of the corn-belt metaphysicals, or present blight of poetic 
professors.   Just as Hart Crane had little influence on anyone 
except very reactionary writers- like Allen Tate, for instance, 
to whom Valery was the last word in modern poetry and the felicities 
of an Apollinaire, let alone a Paul Eluard were nonsense- so Dylan 
Thomas's influence has been slight indeed. In fact, his only 
disciple- the only person to imitate his style- was W& S& Graham, 
who seems to have imitated him without much understanding, and 
who has since moved on to other methods. Thomas's principal influence 
lay in the communication of an attitude- that of the now extinct 
British romantic school of the New Apocalypse- Henry Treece, J& 
F& Hendry, and others- all of whom were quite conventional 
poets.   Parker certainly had much more of an influence. At one 
time it was the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school 
band in America to blow like Bird. Even before his death this influence 
had begun to ebb. In fact, the whole generation of the founding 
fathers of bop- Gillespie, Monk, Davis, Blakey, and the 
rest- 
are just now at a considerable discount. The main line of development 
today goes back to Lester Young and by-passes them.   The point 
is that many of the most impressive developments in the arts nowadays 
are aberrant, idiosyncratic. There is no longer any sense of continuing 
development of the sort that can be traced from Baudelaire to 
Eluard, or for that matter, from Hawthorne through Henry James to 
Gertrude Stein. The cubist generation before World War /1,, and, 
on a lower level, the surrealists of the period between the wars, both 
assumed an accepted universe of discourse, in which, to quote Andre 
Breton, it was possible to make definite advances, exactly as in the 
sciences. I doubt if anyone holds such ideas today. Continuity exits, 
but like the neo-swing music developed from Lester Young, it is 
a continuity sustained by popular demand.   In the plastic arts, 
a very similar situation exists. Surrealists like Hans Arp and Max 
Ernst might talk of creation by hazard- of composing pictures by 
walking on them with painted soles, or by tossing bits of paper up in 
the air. But it is obvious that they were self-deluded. Nothing looks 
anything like an Ernst or an Arp but another Ernst or Arp. Nothing 
looks less like their work than the happenings of random occasion. 
Many of the post-World War /2, abstract expressionists, apostles 
of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard, look alike, and do look 
like accidents. The aesthetic appeal of pure paint laid on at random 
may exist, but it is a very impoverished appeal. Once again what has 
happened is an all-consuming confabulation of the incidentals, the accidents
