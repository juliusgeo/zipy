wagons, roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms are braced 
and waiting.   I hope it can be said without boasting that 
no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty 
of scene, such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and 
such decent, far-flung over-night accommodations.   Maybe motel-keeping 
isn't the nation's biggest industry, but it certainly looks 
that way from the highway.   There are motels for all purposes 
and all tastes. There are even motels for local weather peculiarities, 
as I discovered in Shamrock, Tex&. There the Royal Motel 
advertises "all facilities, vented heat, air conditioned, carpeted, 
free ~TV, storm cellar". 

#MANY WITH POOLS#

Innumerable motels 
from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ("swim at your 
own risk" is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools). 
Some even boast two pools, one for adults and one for children. But 
the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort 
and security of a storm cellar.   Motorists like myself who 
can remember the old "tourists accommodated" signs on farm houses 
and village homes before World War /2, can only marvel at the great 
size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business. 

#ALL FOR $14!#

At the Boxwood Motel in Winchester, 
Va&, we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with 
wall-to-wall carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade 
chairs, 24-inch ~TV and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels. 
All for $14.   That made up for the "best" motel in Norman, 
Okla&, where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when 
we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.

"A Night in New Orleans" is the gayety planned by members 
of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club. 
The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different 
and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition. 
Mrs& H& J& Grinsfelder is chairman.   The Louisiana 
city is known, of course, for its fine food, good music and its colorful 
hospitality "and, 
when guests arrive at Philmont that night", 
says Mrs& Grinsfelder, "that is exactly what we expect to offer 
them. We've been working for weeks. The prospects look great. 
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats. But we can't 
tell it all now and then have no new excitement later". 

#BASIN STREET 
BEAT#

But she does indicate festivities will start early, that 
a jazz combo will "give with the Basin Street beat" during the 
cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take 
over during the dancing.   As for food, Mrs& Henry Louchheim, 
chairman of this phase, 
is a globetrotter who knows good food. "New 
Orleans"? she says, "of course I've had the best. It 
is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no ~R's, 
so no oysters. But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties. 
I know they will be good. We've tried them out on the club chef- 
or say, he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best". 

#SCENIC EFFECTS#

Guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic 
effects. There will be masses of flowers, reproductions of the 
handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are 
typical of New Orleans. Mrs& Harry K& Cohen is chairman of this 
phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A& Van Hollander, 
display director of Gimbel Brothers.   The gala is the Thrift 
Shop's annual bundle party and, as all Thrift Shop friends 
know, that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition, 
contributions of household equipment, bric-a-brac and such to 
stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters at 1213 Walnut St&. 

#BUNDLE CENTERS#

For the convenience of guests bundle centers 
have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations 
may be deposited between now and the date of the big event. In addition 
to the bundles, guests pay the cost of their dinners. Members 
of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing 
time are welcomed.   The Thrift Shop, with Mrs& Bernhard 
S& Blumenthal as president, is one of the city's most successful 
fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies. Some idea 
of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made 
by them during the past 25 years that totals $840,000. 

#IT'S BIG 
BUSINESS#

"Big business, this little Thrift Shop business", 
say the members. For most of the 25 years the operation was under feminine 
direction. In the past few years the men, mostly husbands of members, 
have taken an interest. Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's 
committee that, among other jobs, takes over part of the responsibility 
for staffing the shop during its evening hours.   Mrs& Theodore 
Kapnek is vice chairman of the committee for the gala. Mrs& 
Richard Newburger is chairman of hostesses.   Mrs& Arthur 
Loeb is making arrangements for a reception; Mrs& Joan Lichtenstein, 
for publicity; Mrs& Harry M& Rose, Jr&, for secretarial 
duties; Mrs& Ralph Taussig, for junior aides; Mr& and 
Mrs& B& Lewis Kaufnabb, for senior aides, and Mrs& Samuel 
P& Weinberg, for the bundles.   In addition, Mr& and Mrs& 
Allan Goodman are controllers, Mrs& Paul Stone is treasurer 
and Mrs& Albert Quell is in charge of admittance for the dancing 
at 9 P& M&.   Besides the bundle centers where contributions 
may be made there will be facilities at Philmont Country Club 
for those who would like to bring the bundles on the night of the party.

The women's committee of St& David's Church will hold 
its annual pre-Fair pink parade, a dessert bridge and fashion show at 
1 P& M& on Monday, April 17, in the chapel assembly room, Wayne.

Mrs& Robert O& Spurdle is chairman of the committee, 
which includes Mrs& James A& Moody, Mrs& Frank C& Wilkinson, 
Mrs& Ethel Coles, Mrs& Harold G& Lacy, Mrs& 
Albert W& Terry, Mrs& Henry M& Chance, 2d, Mrs& Robert 
O& Spurdle, Jr&, Mrs& Harcourt N& Trimble, Jr&, Mrs& 
John A& Moller, Mrs& Robert Zeising, Mrs& William 
G& Kilhour, Mrs& Hughes Cauffman, Mrs& John L& Baringer 
and Mrs& Clyde Newman.   The fashion show, by Natalie 
Collett will have Mrs& John Newbold as commentator. Models will 
be Mrs& Samuel B& D& Baird, Mrs& William H& Meyle, 
Jr&, Mrs& Richard W& Hole, Mrs& William F& Harrity, 
Mrs& Robert O& Spurdle, Mrs& E& H& Kloman, Mrs& 
Robert W& Wolcott, Jr&, 
Mrs& Frederick C& Wheeler, Jr&, 
Mrs& William ~A Boyd, ~Mrs F& Vernon Putt.

Col& Clifton Lisle, of Chester Springs, who headed the Troop 
Committee for much of its second and third decades, is now an honorary
