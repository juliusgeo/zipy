remember nothing but ruined cellars and tumbled pillars, and nobody has 
lived there in the memory of any living man. It is now a sweep of boulders 
and ledges, with oak, walnut and sumac creeping across the common, 
and everywhere the ruins and the long, long shadows.   That's 
your setting, and a sinister one. Please get that in your reports. 
It accounts for so many things. Both Red McIver and Handley Walker 
lived nearby, almost as near as I do. Red lived at Lanesville, 
and from his house he could be up on the Common in a half hour's 
brisk walk; Handley lived further on, at Pigeon Cove. I'd often 
find one or other of them up around Dogtown sketching. They were 
both 
painters, (They were? They are? What should one say?) Well, 
anyhow, Dogtown Common is so much off the beaten track nowadays 
that only Sunday picnickers still stray up there, from time to 
time. Sea-road, railroad, lack of water, killed Dogtown. Dead, dead 
as a brass door nail, and I sometimes feel like the Sexton, for I'm 
about the last to be even interested.   I knew Red and Handley 
well. As I said, they were both painters. They'd come, separately, 
to Gloucester some twenty years ago- there's always been an 
artists' colony somewhere on Cape Ann- and each married here. 
They married cousins, Anta and Freya Norberg. There are a lot of 
Scandinavians in this neck of the woods, and many still make painted 
furniture and take steam-baths. Pretty girls among them, with blonde 
hair and pert faces. Handley married Freya and Red, of the red beard, 
married Anta. And it was because of an old Norberg inheritance that 
I got to understand them all so well. The quarrel ended in a ridiculous 
draw, but I must tell you about it. Oh, yes, I'm quite sure 
it's important, because of the Beech Pasture. What's that? 
Why, that's what gave me the feeling, gave me as-it-were the spirit, 
the demoniac, evil spirit of this whole affair.   You see, besides 
being custodian of antiquities, I am also registrar. No, I don't 
hold with those who live entirely among dead things. I know as 
well as the next man that a ship is called from the rigging she carries, 
where the live wind blows, and not from the hull. But you've got 
to know both. What's below the water-line interests me also. As I 
was saying, I've known all about the old records, including the old 
Norberg deed. Some ten years ago that page was torn out, I don't 
know by whom. About five years ago, Handley came to ask me if he 
could see the tattered register. He was courteous and casual about it, 
as though it were of no consequence. He's always like that, in spite 
of being a big man. (When you see him, you'll notice his habit 
of fingering, I might almost say, stroking a large mole with black hairs 
on it, by his right temple.) A sensual man, but very courteous, some 
would say slick. Like his glossy black hair. Too many outside manners, 
to my taste. He is the sort who, with an appraising eye, would 
cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch her. 
A real gentleman, I feel, would do neither. He's always worn 
a broad-brimmed hat, and I've noticed, in my small study at the Society, 
that he rather smells of cosmetics. The next week, cousin Red 
wandered in as casually, but curt and untidy. Red was small and fine-boned, 
like ivory-inlay. He too asked to see the same page. When I 
told him someone had torn it out, he shouted. "By God, it's that 
damn Handley, the sneak"! And later in the same week they both 
came together to examine the register. Fortunately we were alone in 
the building- so few people nowadays are interested even in their own 
past or in the lovely craft of other days- for they began to abuse 
each other in the foulest language. Red thrusting out his tawny beard, 
Handley glowering under his suddenly rumpled black hair. They actually 
bristled. <Le rouge et le noir>. Violent men both. Red always 
was morose, yet that day the dapper Handley was the louder of the 
two. But for my presence, they would have been at each others' throats.

During the quarrel I learned what the trouble was, from 
the accusations each hurled at the other. The Beech Pasture had 
suddenly 
become valuable. There's a fine granite quarry there, and granite's 
coming back for public buildings. Both men knew it was in the 
Norberg family holdings, but to which of the cousins did it belong, 
Anta or Freya? Fortunately, I knew almost exactly what the will 
had said. It began with a preamble, of course. This explained that the 
judge of probate of Essex County, 1785 or 1786, appointed three free-holders 
of Gloucester to divide and establish the Norberg estate. 
After the usual Honorable Sirs, it went on to say that there had 
been set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of 
the deceased Salu Norberg, one lower room, on the Western side, privileges 
to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar (I 
can show you the cellar when we go up), also one Cow Right, and lastly 
they set off to the widow her own land that she brought with her as 
dower, namely the Beech Pasture. And I remember that the whole of 
the privileges, not counting the Beech Pasture, was valued at twenty 
pounds. I wish you could have seen the crests fall on these two sparring 
coxcombs when I told them that obviously the pasture belonged 
to their wives jointly.   That battle scene, ridiculous at it was, 
remained in my mind. A disturbing picture of bad blood, to be further 
heightened with illicit if buccolic colors, for on a subsequent day 
I saw Handley escorting Anta, Red's wife, up on Dogtown Common. 
I felt it would be inopportune to disclose my presence. Not that 
I intentionally go unperceived, but the boulders up there are very high 
and I am a small woman.

One other cause of jealousy between them 
I must tell you. Paint! Gloomy and unkempt as Red McIver was, 
he was much the better painter. I suppose Handley knew it. If Red 
had a show at Gloucester, Handley would hurry to hang his pictures in 
Rockport. You may say this has little pertinence, but, gentlemen, 
remember that all this prepared my mind, alerted my intelligence. By 
such touches the pattern takes shape. You would call these the motives 
of crime. I would call them the patterns of life, perhaps even the 
designs of destiny. Yet with all this knowledge I had nothing of substance 
to unravel our case, as you would call it, till yesterday.

One month ago, on the 20th of October, was the opening of the gunning 
season in Massachusetts. Not much to shoot, but there are a few 
pheasant. Rabbits, too, if you care for them, which most of the folk 
around here haven't the sense to appreciate. Any more than they have 
the sense to eat mussels. That was the day Red was said to have 
gone away. Oh yes, he'd talked about doing so. In fact, he often disappeared, 
from time to time,- off to paint the sea, aboard a dragger 
out from Gloucester. Anta, his wife, never seemed to mind. I suppose 
these absences gave her more clearance for her embraces with Cousin 
Handley. Anyhow, I wasn't surprised, early that morning, to see 
Handley himself crossing from Dogtown Common Road to the Back 
Road. No, he didn't have his gun, which he should have. It would 
have been a good excuse for his being there at all. I myself had been 
up there by seven o'clock, after mushrooms, since there'd been a 
week of rain which had stopped early that morning and the day was as clear 
as Sandwich glass.

That's what the man had said. Haney peered doubtfully at his 
drinking companion through bleary, tear-filled eyes. He had no ready 
answer, as much from surprise as from the fit of coughing. Was the 
man drunk or crazy or both? But his new-found buddy had matched him 
drink for drink until he lost count, and the man's eyes were still 
clear.   <The guy is off his rocker,> Haney thought to himself, 
and looked away from those eyes. Eyes that were clear, but also bright 
with a strange intensity, a sort of cold fire burning behind them. 
Why hadn't he noticed it before? No, the man was not drunk **h

He wondered how he got tied up with this stranger. But, of course, 
he remembered now. It was blurred, after two hours of steady drinking, 
but the occasion of it came back to him. The stranger, his head 
seemingly sunk in thought, started to cross the street against the 
light just as a huge moving van roared through the intersection.

Brakes howled and a horn blared furiously, but the man would have 
been hit if Phil hadn't called out to him a second before. His shout 
had been involuntary, something anybody might have done without thinking, 
on the spur of the moment. As a matter of fact, he wouldn't 
have cared at all if the guy had been hit. Actually, he regretted having 
opened his mouth when the truck came to a stop and the angry driver 
jumped down from the cab and walked back toward them.   By then, 
the stranger was thanking Haney profusely and had one arm around his 
shoulders as if he were an old friend. So the driver started to curse 
at both of them as if they had been in a plot together to ruin his 
safe-driving record.   Then the man he saved turned and looked 
squarely into the truck driver's face, without saying a word. Very 
suddenly, the driver stopped swearing at them, turned on his heel and 
went back to his truck.   Haney hadn't given it much thought at 
the time. Now he recalled it very clearly, and wondered what the truck 
driver had seen in those eyes to make him back off. It must have 
been the sort of look that can call a bluff without saying a word.

When the light went their way, they went on across the street. And 
when the stranger found out that Phil was on the way to one of his 
favorite bars, he insisted on offering to buy drinks for both of them.

Phil usually went alone and kept to himself, sitting in a corner 
and passing the time by nursing his favorite grudges. But he decided 
he wouldn't mind company in return for free drinks, even though 
he made good money at his job. Phil was like that. ##

NOW 
he wondered 
if it was worth it, having a screwball for company. He really 
didn't take the offer seriously, but he began to feel uneasy. When 
he finally got the coughing under control, he realized that Pete (all 
he gave was his first name) was still waiting for an answer- he didn't 
even seem to wink as he continued to stare.   Haney managed 
a weak laugh. "Guess I can't think of anyone, Pete. Thanks anyhow".

A faint crease appeared between the man's eyebrows. 
"I think you aren't taking me seriously, Phil. I meant it. And 
everybody has some kind of grudge. I might have got hit by that truck 
if it wasn't for you. I believe in returning favors. I'll do 
anything for somebody I like. It won't cost you a cent, Phil. Go 
ahead and try me"!   Phil rubbed his forehead wearily. He 
was beginning to feel woolly. Maybe it would be better to humor the 
guy and then make an exit. He really didn't expect anything to come 
of it, and there <were> a few people **h   "All right", 
he 
conceded finally, "if you must know, I don't get along with the 
landlord. He keeps riding me because I like to listen to the radio 
and sing while I'm taking a bath. He says the neighbors complain, 
but I don't believe it. Why don't they tell me themselves if it 
bothers them"?   The man closed his eyes and nodded. When he 
looked up again, he seeemd almost contented. "Fine. Give me your 
address. It will take a little time. I want to study your landlord's 
habits and movements first. You see, I always make it look like 
an accident. Maybe suicide, if it looks reasonable. In that way there's 
no trouble for the customer".   Haney's eyebrows flew 
up. <"Customer"?>   Pete smiled modestly. "It's my 
line of work", he said **h   Five minutes later, before Haney 
could make his break, the stranger stood up and nodded farewell. Haney 
watched the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently, 
and felt relieved to see that nobody else seemed to notice his departure.

Phil decided to stay a little longer, and as time passed 
it seemed as if the strange little man had never been there, but for 
the other glass on the table. Some time before midnight he returned 
to his apartment and hit the sack, putting the whole incident out of
