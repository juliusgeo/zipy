
"A charcoal pit, man", he said, indicating the 
slightly-smoking 
makeshift brazier. "Fan it", he told Cappy, handing him 
a sheet of newspaper.   "Yeah, but what're we gonna eat? 
Charcoal"?   "Fella", Ernie waggled a dirty finger at 
the younger man, "you try my ever-lovin' patience". He reached 
once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners.

"Hot dogs, man. Not the greatest, but they stick to your belly 
insides".   He ripped down the cellophane carefully, and laid 
three dogs on the tin foil. Almost immediately they began to sizzle. 
He looked up and grinned.   "A Kroger's self-serve", he 
explained. "I self served". ##

WHEN THEY HAD LICKED the 
last of the wieners' taste from their fingers, they settled back, 
and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette. <Nice kid>, Ernie thought, 
<too bad>.   "How come you're riding the rods, kids like you"? 
Ernie asked.   Cappy looked down at his wide hands, and 
did not reply. But surprisingly, Kitty's face came up and she said, 
"My father. He didn't want us to get married. So we ran away".

"Why didn't he want you to get hitched"? 
This time even she did not answer. She looked down at her hands, too. 
After a few seconds, she said, "Dad didn't like Cappy. It was 
my fault".   Cappy's head came around sharply. "Your fault, 
hell! It was all my fault. If I'd been careful it never woulda"- 
he stopped abruptly.   Ernie's eyebrows went up. "What's 
the matter"?   The girl still did not raise her 
eyes, but she added simply, "I'm pregnant".   Cappy raged 
at himself. "Oh he was stupid, her old man! You never heard nothin' 
like it: Kitty's gonna go have an abortion, and Kitty's 
gonna go away to a convent, and Kitty's this and Kitty's that **h 
like he was nuts or somethin', y'know"?   Ernie nodded. 
This was a slightly different matter. He remembered Midge, and the 
child. But that had been a time before all this, a time he didn't 
think about. A time before the white lightning and the bumming had 
turned him inside out. But these kids weren't like him.   <Oh 
crap!> he thought, <Pull out of it, old son. These are just another 
couple of characters to roll. What they got, you get. Now forget 
all this other>.   "Wanna drink"? Ernie offered, taking 
the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket.   "Yeah. Now 
that you offer". The answer came from the open door of the boxcar. 
From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside, as the train 
had slowed on the grade.   Ernie stared at the man. He was 
big. Real big, with shoulders out to here, and hair all over him like 
a grizzly. <Road gang>, 
Ernie thought.   "You gonna give 
me a drink, fella"? the big man asked again, taking a step into the 
boxcar.   Ernie hesitated a moment. This character could break 
him in half. "Sure", he said, and lifted the pint to his own lips. 
He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered 
the remainder. The man stalked toward them, his big boots heavy 
on the wooden flooring. He took the bottle with undue belligerence, 
and making sucking noises with his thick lips, drained it completely.

He threw his head back, closed his eyes, and belched ferociously. 
He belched again, and opening his eyes, threw the bottle out the 
open door.   "Well, now", he said, and reached into his pocket. 
"I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car".

"We're going to Philadelphia", Kitty said, pulling her skirt 
down around her legs all the more.   "No, I don't think 
so", said the big man, and it was the final clincher for Ernie. He 
had suspected this guy was trouble, and now he was sure of it.

"Maybe you and me will, girlie, but these two ain't goin' nowhere".

He advanced on them, and abruptly there was a shocked 
electricity in the car. Ernie was screaming inside himself: <No, 
damn you, you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me!>

The newcomer stalked toward them, and Kitty shied back, her hand 
to her mouth. Her scream split up the silence of the car, accompanied 
by the rattling of the freight, and then Cappy came off the floor, 
his legs driving him hard. The kid hit the bigger man with an audible 
thwump! and carried him backward in a footballer's tackle. They 
went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but 
flailing arms and legs.   The kid showed for an instant, and his 
arm was cocked back. The fist went down into the pile of flesh, and 
Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go, "Aaawww"!

Then they were tumbling again, and the big man reached into the 
same pocket he had gone for earlier, and came up with a vicious switchblade.

He held the knife aloft an instant- an instant enough 
to press the stud. The blade came out with a <snick!> He fisted 
the knife overhand, and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat.

Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white. She grabbed 
at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked, "Help him! Help him! 
Do something"!

They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man. To them he could 
have been the broken bell in the church tower which rang before and 
after Mass, and at noon, and at six each evening- its tone, repetitive, 
monotonous, never breaking the boredom of the streets. The Old 
Man was unimportant.   Yet if he were not there, they would have 
missed him, as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against 
the screen door in early June; or the smell of thick tomato paste- 
the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour- rising up from 
aluminum trays wrapped in fly-dotted cheesecloth. Or the surging whirling 
sounds of bats at night, when their black bodies dived into the blackness 
above and below the amber street lights. Or the bay of female 
dogs in heat.   They never called him by name, although he had 
one. Filippo Rossi, that's what he was called in the old country; 
but here he was just <Signore> or the Old Man. But this was 
not unusual, because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance 
from its elders. Youth obeyed when commanded. It went to church 
on Sunday and one Saturday a month went to confession. But youth 
asked nothing of its parents- not a touch of the hand or a kiss given 
in passing.   The only thing unusual about the Old Man had 
long since happened. But the past was dead here as the present was dead. 
Once the Old Man had had a wife. And once she, too, ignored him. 
With a tiny fur-piece wrapped around her shoulders, she wiggled her 
satin-covered buttocks down the street before him and didn't stop. 
In one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw 
suitcase. The way she strutted down the street, the Old Man would 
have been blind not to have noticed both. Without looking at him, 
without looking at anything except Drexel Street directly in front of 
her, she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars, rode away in 
it, and never came back.   "But she shouldn't have come here 
in the first place", the women had said.   "No, no. Not 
that one. She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from 
Torino".   "Eh, Torino! She gave herself fancy airs! 
Just because she had a part on the stage in the old country, she thought 
she could carry her head higher than ours". They had slapped 
their thighs.   "It's not for making pretty speeches about Dante 
those actresses get paid so good".   "Henh"! Calloused 
fingers, caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries, had 
swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted, 
never to be tweezed away. Mauve-colored mouths that had never known 
anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's 
tongue had not smiled, but had condemned again and again. "<Puttana>"!

But if the Old Man even thought about his wife 
now, nobody cared a fig. It was enough for people to know that at 
one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman 
he had consumed- watching her become thinner and thinner in the 
distance, as thin as the seams on her stockings, and still thinner. His 
voice had not commanded her to stop. It had not questioned why. The 
women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell; but he 
might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog 
onto him. (He was never without that dog.) And his eyes- those miniature 
sundials of variegated yellow- had not altered their expression 
or direction. The Old Man's very soul could have left him and 
flown down that street, but he wouldn't have had anyone know it.

Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come 
from and where it was taking his wife. But when he called for his 
withered, wrinkled sister Rose to care for him and the children, had 
he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of 
her climbing into that streetcar?   There seemed to be a contemptuous 
purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to Drexel 
Street and his back in opposition to the church behind him. For all 
he saw or cared to see, this could have been a town in Italy, not the 
outskirts of Philadelphia. It could have been Bari or Chieti for 
the way it smelled. What did it matter to him that the park at the foot 
of Ash Road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the 
stucco station into the city's center at half-hour intervals? Or 
that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the 
Schuylkill? 
This place was hatred to him, just as hatred was his only companion 
in his aloneness. To him they were one and the same.   Sameness 
for the Old Man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided 
these quarters from the city. Sameness lined the streets with two-story 
houses the color of ash. It slashed the sloping manure-scented 
lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches. 
It swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges 
of screen doors.   Even the stable-garage, which housed nothing 
now but the scent of rot, had a lawn before it. And the coffee shop 
on Drexel Street, where the men spent their evenings and Sundays 
playing cards, had a rose hedge beneath its window. The hedge reeked 
of coffee dregs thrown against it.   Only one house on the street 
had no lawn before it. It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk 
with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade. That was Bartoli's 
shop. Above it, from a second-story showroom, wooden angels surveyed 
the neighborhood. Did the Old Man remember them there?

Yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks- 
like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill, rising with 
the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery. 
Only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses 
into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards 
owned no fences, where one man's property blended with the next 
to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy. Love and hatred and 
fear were one here, shaded only by fig trees and grape vines. And the 
forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to 
back porch.   The Old Man silently fed upon these streets. They 
kept him alive, waiting. Waiting for what and for whom, only he could 
tell and would not. It was as though he had made a pact with the 
devil himself, but it was not yet time to pay the price. He was holding 
out for something. He was determined to hold out.

The Old 
Man's son threw himself down, belly first, upon a concrete step, 
taking in the coolness of it, and dreaming of the day he would be rich.
