and careful upkeep. Dives, carefully repaired huts, and nicely 
painted and ornamented cottages were jumbled together cheek by jowl 
with little distinction. The best could not escape from the worst and 
the worst nestled cosily beside the better. The yards, front and back, 
were narrow; some were trash dumps, some had flower gardens. Behind 
were privies, for there was no sewage system.   After looking 
about a bit, Wilson discovered beyond Black Bottom, across the river 
and far removed from the white city, a considerable tract of land, 
and it occurred to him that the church and the better Negro homes might 
gradually be moved to this plot. He talked about it to the Presiding 
Elder. The Presiding Elder looked him over rather carefully. 
He was not sure what kind of a man he had in hand. But there was one 
thing that he had to stress, and that was that the contribution to the 
general church expenses, the dollar money, had been seriously falling 
behind in this church, and that must be looked after immediately. In 
fact, he intimated clearly that that was the reason that Wilson had 
been sent here- to make a larger contribution of dollar money.

Wilson stressed the fact that clear as this was, they must have a 
better church, a more business-like conduct of the church organization, 
and an effort to get this religious center out of its rut of wild worship 
into a modern church organization. He emphasized to the Presiding 
Elder the plan of giving up the old church and moving across the 
river. The Presiding Elder was sure that that would be impossible. 
But he told Wilson to "go ahead and try". And Wilson tried.

It did seem impossible. The bank which held the mortgage on the 
old church declared that the interest was considerably in arrears, and 
the real estate people said flatly that the land across the river was 
being held for an eventual development for white working people who 
were coming in, and that none would be sold to colored folk. When it 
was proposed to rebuild the church, Wilson found that the terms for 
a new mortgage were very high. He was sure that he could do better if 
he went to Atlanta to get the deal financed.   But when this proposal 
was made to his Deacon Board, he met unanimous opposition. The 
church certainly would not be removed. The very proposition was sacrilege. 
It had been here fifty years. It was going to stay forever. 
It was hardly possible to get any argument on the subject. As for 
rebuilding, well, that might be looked into, but there was no hurry, no 
hurry at all.   Wilson again went downtown to a different banker, 
an intelligent young white man who seemed rather sympathetic, but 
he shook his head.   "Reverend", he said, "I think you don't 
quite understand the situation here. Don't you see the amount 
of money that has been invested by whites around that church? Tenements, 
stores, saloons, some gambling, I hope not too much. The colored 
people are getting employment at Kent House and other places, and 
they are near their places of employment. When a city has arranged 
things like this you cannot easily change them. Now, if I were you I 
would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or 
ten years. By that time, perhaps something better can be done".

Then Wilson asked, "What about this Kent House which you 
mention? I don't understand why a white hotel should be down here".

The young banker looked at him with a certain surprise, and 
then he said flatly: "I'm afraid I can't tell you anything 
in particular about Kent House. You'll have to find out about it 
on your own. Hope to see you again". And he dismissed the colored 
pastor.   It was next day that Sojourner came and sat beside 
him and took his hand. She said, "My dear, do you know what Kent 
House is"?   "No", said Wilson, "I don't. I was 
just asking about it. What is it"?   "It's a house of prostitution 
for white men with white girls as inmates. They hire 
a good deal of local labor, including two members of our Trustee Board. 
They buy some supplies from our colored grocers and they are patronized 
by some of the best white gentlemen in town".  Wilson stared 
at her. "My dear, you must be mistaken".   "Talk to 
Mrs& Catt", she said.   And after Wilson had talked to Mrs& 
Catt and to others, he was absolutely amazed. This, of course, was 
the sort of thing that used to take place in Southern cities- putting 
white houses of prostitution with colored girls in colored neighborhoods 
and carrying them on openly. But it had largely disappeared on 
account of protest by the whites and through growing resentment on the 
part of the Negroes as they became more educated and got better wages.

But this situation of Kent House was more subtle. The wages 
involved were larger and more regular. The inmates were white and 
from out of town, avoiding local friction. The backing from the white 
town was greater and there was little publicity. Good wages, patronage 
and subscription of various kinds stopped open protest from Negroes. 
And yet Wilson knew that this place must go or he must go. And 
for him to leave this job now without accomplishing anything would mean 
practically the end of his career in the Methodist church, if not 
in all churches. 
Payne dismounted in Madison Place and handed the reins to Herold. 
There was a fog, which increased the darkness of the night. Two gas 
lamps were no more than a misleading glow. He might have been anywhere 
or nowhere.   The pretence was that he was delivering a prescription 
from Dr& Verdi. Secretary of State Seward was a sick man. 
The idea had come from Herold, who had once been a chemist's clerk. 
The sick were always receiving medicines. No one would question 
such an errand. The bottle was filled up with flour.   Before Payne 
loomed the Old Clubhouse, Seward's home, where Key had once 
been killed. Now it would have another death. From the outside it 
was an ordinary enough house of the gentry. He clomped heavily up the 
stoop and rang the bell. Like the bell at Mass, the doorbell was pitched 
too high. It was still Good Friday, after all.   A nigger 
boy opened the door. Payne did not notice him. He was thinking chiefly 
of Cap. If their schedules were to synchronize, there was no point 
in wasting time. He pushed his way inside.   For a moment 
the hall confused him. This was the largest house he had ever been in, 
almost the largest building, except for a hotel. He had no idea where 
Seward's room would be. In the half darkness the banisters gleamed, 
and the hall seemed enormous. Above him somewhere were the bedrooms. 
Seward would be up there.   He explained his errand, but without 
bothering much to make it plausible, for he felt something well 
up in him which was the reason why he had fled the army. He did not 
really want to kill, but as in the sexual act, there was a moment when 
the impulse took over and could not be downed, even while you watched 
yourself giving way to it. He was no longer worried. Everything would 
be all right. He knew that in this mood he could not be stopped.

Still, the sensation always surprised him. It was a thrill he 
felt no part in. He could only watch with a sort of gentle dismay while 
his body did these quick, appalling, and efficient things.   He 
brushed by the idiotic boy and lumbered heavily up the stairs. They 
were carpeted, but made for pumps and congress gaiters, not the great 
clodhoppers he wore. The sound of his footsteps was like a muffled 
drum.   At the top of the stairs he ran into somebody standing there 
angrily in a dressing gown. He stopped and whispered his errand. 
Young Frederick Seward held out his hand. Panting a little, Payne 
shook his head. Dr& Verdi had told him to deliver his package in 
person.   Frederick Seward said his father was sleeping, and then 
went through a pantomime at his father's door, to prove the statement.

"Very well", Payne said. "I will go". He smiled, 
but now that he knew where the elder Seward was, he did not intend 
to go. He pulled out his pistol and fired it. It made no sound. It 
had misfired. Reversing it, he smashed the butt down on Frederick 
Seward's head, over and over again.   It was the first blow 
that was always difficult. After that, violence was exultantly easy. 
He got caught up into it and became a different person. Only afterwards 
did an act like that become meaningless, so that he would puzzle over 
it for days, whereas at the time it had seemed quite real. 
The nigger boy fled down the stairs, screaming, "Murder". 
It was not murder at all. Payne was more methodical than that. He 
was merely clearing a way to what he had to do.   He ran for the 
sick room, found his pistol was broken, and threw it away. A knife would 
do. From childhood he had known all about knives. Someone blocked 
the door from inside. He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness. 
He saw only dimly moving figures, but when he slashed them they yelled 
and fled. He went for the bed, jumped on it, and struck where he could, 
repeatedly. It was like finally getting into one's own nightmares 
to punish one's dreams.   Two men pulled him off. Nobody 
said anything. Payne hacked at their arms. There was a lady there, in 
a nightdress. He would not have wanted to hurt a lady. Another man 
approached, this one fully dressed. When the knife went into his chest, 
he went down at once.   "I'm mad", shouted Payne, as 
he ran out into the hall. "I'm mad", and only wished he had been. 
That would have made things so much easier. But he was not mad. He 
was only dreaming.   He clattered down the stairs and out of 
the door. Somewhere in the fog, the nigger boy was still yelling murder. 
One always wakes up, even from one's own dreams. The clammy air 
revived him. Herold, he saw, had fled.   Well, one did not expect 
much of people like Herold.   He unhitched his horse, walked 
it away, mounted, and spurred it on. The nigger boy was close 
behind him. Then the nigger boy turned back and he was alone. He rode 
on and on. He had no idea where he was. After some time he came to 
an open field. An open field was better than a building, that was for 
sure, so he dismounted, turned off the horse, and plunged through the 
grass.   He felt curiously sleepy, the world seemed far away; 
he knew he should get to Cap, but he didn't know how. He was sure, 
for he had done as he was told, hadn't he? Cap would find him 
and take care of him. So choosing a good tree, he clambered up into it, 
found a comfortable notch, and curled up in it to sleep, like the tousled 
bear he was, with his hands across his chest, as though surfeited 
with honey.   Violence always made him tired, but he was not 
frightened. ##

In Boston, Edwin Booth was winding up a performance 
of <A New Way to Pay Old Debts>. It was a part so familiar 
to him that he did not bother to think about it any more. Acting soothed 
him. On a stage he always knew what to do, and tonight, to judge 
by the applause, he must be doing it better than usual.   As 
Sir Giles Overreach (how often had he had to play that part, who did 
not believe a word of it), he raised his arm and declaimed: "Where 
is my honour now"?   That was one of the high spots of the 
play. The audience, as usual, loved it. He was delighted to see them 
so happy. If he had any worries, it was only the small ones, about 
Mother in New York, and his daughter Edwina and what she might be 
doing at this hour, with her Aunt Asia, in Philadelphia.   Everyone 
is ambivalent about his profession, if he has practised it long 
enough, but there were still moments when he loved the stage and all 
those unseen people out there, who might cheer you or boo you, but that 
was largely, though not entirely, up to you.   They made the 
world seem friendly somehow, though he knew it was not. #/7,#

Wilkes 
was quite right about one thing. Laura Keene had been in the 
green room. The commotion had brought her into the wings. Since she 
could not act, one part suited her as well as any other, and so she was 
the first person to offer Mr& Lincoln a glass of water, holding 
it 
up to the box, high above her head, to Miss Harris, who had asked for 
it.   She had been one of the first to collect her wits.

It was not so much that the shot had stunned the audience, as that 
they had been stunned already. Most of them had seen <Our American 
Cousin> before, and unless Miss Keene was on stage, there was not 
much to it. The theatre was hot and they were drugged with boredom.
