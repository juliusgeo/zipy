tile, plaster base, and asbestos shingles. _3._ Truck and 
materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to 
meet almost every homebuilding need. For some significant new items 
see the pictures. _4._ More than 50% of all lumber is unitized; 
an ~NLRDA survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will 
strap their shipments for mechanized handling. Of these, 376 said they 
make no extra charge for strapping in standard units, because they 
save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost. 
Most of the others 
will swallow their 50@ to $3 charge rather than lose 
a good customer. "With a 15,500-~lb fork-lift, dealers can unload 
unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for 30@/~mbf compared 
with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time", says 
James Wright of ~NLRDA. _5._ Lumber dealers and lumber 
manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments- 
48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high (or six McCracken packets 
24'' wide by nominal 7'' high). These units make it easy to 
load as much as 48,000 ~bd ~ft (say 120,000 ~lb in a 50' box 
car- much more than the average for loose-loaded cars. _6._ The 
railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' 
or wider for forklift unloading (a 21% increase while the total 
number of box cars was falling 6%) and by cutting their freight rates 
twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars. First was a 1958 cut 
of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 
~lb; later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast (still pending elsewhere) 
of 7@/~cwt on 70,000 ~lb-plus carloads (which works out to 
more than $4/~mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 
~lb). _7._ More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars, 
and ~NLRDA studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 
6-~B floating-load method can be unloaded for at little at 5.4@/~mbf. 
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof 
paper. This costs from 75@ to $2.30/~mbf, but the cover can 
pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open. _THESE CARRIERS 
CUT HANDLING COSTS FOR THE DEALER- AND THE BUILDER_ Says ~NRLDA's 
James Wright: "Since 1958 carriers that move material 
from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes 
than any of the dealer's other equipment".   The reason: today's 
components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled 
by a truckdriver and a helper. So manufacturers have pioneered a new 
type of vehicle- the self-unloading carrier. It cuts the lumber dealer's 
cost because it takes only one man- the driver- to unload 
it, and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction 
of the cost of hand unloading. and it helps the builder because it 
can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can deliver it to the best 
spot (in some cases, right on the roof or inside the house), and never 
takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.

Says Wright: "Our survey shows that one third of the 
retail 
dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling 
in the coming two years. And most of the gain will be in self-unloading 
vehicles". 

#NEW RULE NO& 4: RESTUDY WHAT YOUR MEN DO, 
TO HELP THEM WASTE LESS OF THE TIME YOU PAY FOR#

Half the manhours 
you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right, 
so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right 
time, or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots 
or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection, or you 
bought cheap materials that took too long to fit, or your workmen had 
to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.

Even "America's most efficient builder", Bob Schmitt 
of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a 
result of the time-+-motion studies now being completed on his operation 
by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works. Already 
this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 
170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.   Builder 
Eddie Carr of Washington, past president of ~NAHB, cut his bricklaying 
costs $150 a house by adopting the "~SCR masonry process" 
worked out after careful time-+-motion studies by the Structural 
Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better 
work for less. A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand 
bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process, cut them another 
$7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot 100-brick 
packages. The ~SCR process, with its precision corner-posts, 
its precision guide lines, its working level scaffold, and its hand-level 
brick supply takes eight manhours to get set, but once ready 
it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day. See 
<page 156>.   One good way to cut your labor waste is to make 
sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew. Reports 
Jim Lendrum: "By studying men on the job, we found that two men- 
a carpenter and a helper- can lay a floor faster than three. We 
found that three men- two carpenters and a helper- can put up wall 
panels or trusses more economically than four men- because four men 
don't make two teams; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper 
team. We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job, 
five men, not four, is the magic number".   No house was ever 
built that could not have been built better for less if the work had 
been better planned and the work better scheduled. 

#NEW RULE NO& 
5: DON'T WASTE ANY 10@-A-MINUTE TIME ON GREEN LUMBER TO SAVE 3@ 
A STUD#

This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a builder 
can commit.   Green lumber was all very well back in the days 
of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then 
shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum. But now that all production 
builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels, 
green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.   Green 
studs cost about 65@; dry studs cost less than 3@ more. So if 
a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste 
even 20 seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry 
stud.

There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to 
be alone. Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves, but away from the 
crowds and common happenstance. If you've travelled in Europe a 
time or two, it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone 
feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic. 
Following a guide, and gratefully so, is an excellent way to 
see all the important places when everything is strange and new. However, 
after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas, the 
places and forums, the churches and museums, the palaces and castles, 
and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe, you'll want to 
change your course and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market 
places.   The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital 
of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has 
at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour d'Argent. You 
can relive history and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest 
for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi, an ancient 
town in the heel of Italy's boot. And you don't meet the folks from 
home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time 
and tourists since the Middle Ages. Time stands still as you climb 
the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain 
slopes or wander through story-book towns, perched atop lofty crags, 
their faces turned to the sea. They've been there since the days 
of the Moors and the Saracens. And what better way to end a day 
than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's 
village on the Mediterranean?   An almost too-simple-to-be-true 
way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself 
behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.   For those 
who need or want and can afford another car, buying one and driving 
it on the grand tour, then shipping it home, is one popular plan for 
a do-it-yourself pilgrimage. Then, of course, there are those of us 
who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car. The answer 
to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one. 
It is that elemental.   Almost any travel agent will reserve 
a car for you. You can call one of the car rental services directly 
(Hertz, Avis, Auto-Europe Nationalcar Rental, and others) and ask 
them to reserve a car of your choice, and some transportation lines 
offer this service as well. With few exceptions, your car will be waiting 
for you at dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you 
arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost. You can wait, of course, until 
you arrive in Europe before renting your car. The disadvantages 
to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models 
readily available or you may have to wait a few days or, during the busy 
tourist season, when cars are in great demand, you might find it fairly 
difficult to get a car at all. Since charges are relatively the 
same, reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of 
having one on tap when you want it.   For those who plan to travel 
to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer 
a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave 
it in another city, or even another country, when you are ready to 
return home. At some cities, this pick-up and delivery service is without 
additional charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning 
your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free delivery 
and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries.

International Touring Documents are usually provided 
with the car as are road maps and touring data. A valid American 
driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal, Spain, 
Yugoslavia and Eastern 
Europe. If you plan to visit any of these countries, 
you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you 
leave at a nominal fee- around $3.00. Your insurance, too, with 
most agencies, is provided with the car, covering comprehensive fire, 
theft, liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies 
in different countries. If you would feel happier with full collision 
insurance, there is a small additional charge, again varying from country 
to country and depending on the term of such insurance. The average 
charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day. 
The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as 50@ a day in 
Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece.   Rental fees 
are variable, too, throughout the countries of Europe. There are as 
many rates as there are countries and models of cars available. As in 
the United States, there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus 
a few cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops if the car 
is retained for a week. It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one 
days.   It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from 
80@ to 90@ for the equivalent of a United States gallon and 
while you might prefer a familiar Ford, Chevrolet or even a Cadillac, 
which are available in some countries, it is probably wiser to choose 
the smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five and 
even forty miles to the gallon.   Your choice of model will undoubtedly 
be governed by the number of people travelling in your group. 
With the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny sedans will 
seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage 
space for really economical transportation. There is a large variety 
of models to choose from in most countries, however, including 6-passenger 
sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that 
much greater than for the wee sedans.   The basic costs are generally 
pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you 
reserve your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages. 
There is the free intra-city "rent it here, leave it there" service, 
as an example, the free delivery and collection at the airport, dockside 
or your hotel, luggage racks, touring documents and information
