
Curt was holding Jess's gun in his left hand. He drew back his 
arm to slash the gunbarrel across Jess's face, but didn't finish 
the motion. Pistol-whipping an unarmed man might come easy to someone 
like Jess, but Curt couldn't bring himself to do it.   Apparently 
sensing this, and realizing that it gave him an advantage, Jess 
became bold.   "Having all the guns makes you a big man, don't 
it, Adams? If we was both armed, you wouldn't talk so tough".

"No"? Curt reached out and dropped Jess's pistol 
back into the holster. He retreated a step and holstered his own.

"All right, Crouch; we're on even terms. Now draw"!

Sweat bubbled out on Jess's swarthy face. The fingers of 
his right hand twisted into a claw, but he didn't reach for the gun.

Curt, angry enough to be a little reckless, raised his hands 
shoulder high.   "Does this make it any easier, coward"?

"I ain't drawin' against you", Jess said thickly. "I 
heard how you outdrew Chico. I ain't a gunslinger".   "No. 
You're the kind of bastard who sneaks up on a man from behind 
and hits him with a club. I just wanted to hear you say so".

Jess stared at him without answering and let his hands fall to his 
sides. He had found Curt's weakness, or what to Jess was a weakness, 
and was smart enough to take advantage of it.   Somewhere in 
the distance, a woman screamed. Curt was too involved in his own problems 
to pay much attention. He had to make Jess talk, and he had to 
do it before Stacey Black got curious and came to investigate. Once 
more he lifted Jess's gun from its holster, only this time he tossed 
it into the stall with the frightened buckskin. He dropped his own 
beside it.   "We'll do it another way, then", he said harshly.

Jess's coarse features twisted in a surprised grin which 
was smashed out of shape by Curt's fist. With a roar of pain 
and fury Jess made his attack.   Curt managed to duck beneath the 
man's flailing fist, and drove home a solid left to Jess's mid-section. 
It was like hitting a sack of salt. Pain shout up Curt's 
arm clear to the shoulder, but Jess seemed hardly aware that he had 
been hit. He slammed into the wall, bounced back, and caught Curt with 
a roundhouse right which sent him spinning. An inch lower and it 
would have knocked him out. As it was, his vision blurred and for a moment 
he was unable to move. When his eyes began to focus, he saw Jess 
charging at him with a pitchfork.   Curt twisted to one side, 
and the tines of the fork bit into the floor. Jess wasted a few seconds 
trying to yank them loose. It gave Curt time to stagger to his feet.

The tines broke off under Jess's twisting, and he swung 
the handle in an attempt to knock Curt's brains out. His aim was 
hurried; so the pitchfork whistled over Curt's head.   By 
now Curt was seeing clearly again. He stepped inside Jess's guard 
and landed two blows to the big man's belly, putting everything he 
had behind them. They made Jess double over. When his head came down, 
Curt grabbed him by the hair and catapulted him head first into the 
wall.   The building shook, setting the lantern to swaying, and 
the buckskin to pitching again. Even Black's old crowbait began 
to snort, and from the house Black yelled, "Jess! What's going 
on out there"?   Jess didn't seem too sure himself. He 
lurched drunkenly to his feet, lowered his head, and took one step away 
from the wall. Curt caught him flush on the nose with a blow which 
started at the floor.   Jess had had enough. Blood gushed from 
his nose, and he backed off as rapidly as he could, stumbling over his 
own feet in his frantic haste to get away from Curt's fists.

Curt was in almost as bad shape, but he wouldn't quit. He backed 
Jess into a corner, grabbed a handful of the man's shirtfront, and 
drew back his right fist.   "Tell me about Arbuckle! You 
killed him, didn't you"?   "It was Brenner's idea", 
Jess mumbled, dabbing at his nose. "He found out about you and Arbuckle 
talking. He wanted to show the town what happened to anyone who 
tried to start trouble".   "You mean anyone who stood up 
for his rights", Curt said. He let go of the shirt, and Jess slumped 
to the floor. Turning his back, Curt crossed to the stall, reached 
over to untie the buckskin's halter rope, and waved his hand in the 
animal's face.   The buckskin bolted out of the stall. Curt 
moved in and picked up his gun. He shook loose straw out of the action, 
and placed the gun in his holster. Leaving Jess's where it lay, 
he left the stall.   "Get up, Crouch. We're going someplace".

Jess painfully got to his feet as someone rattled the 
door.   "Who's in there"? Black called fearfully.

Curt opened the door, grabbed Black by the shoulder, and pulled him 
into the barn.   "You're staying right here for a while. 
This dirty coward just admitted killing Arbuckle. I'm going to let 
him tell it to somebody else". He shoved Black toward the stall, 
and pointed his pistol at Jess.   "Get out of here. You're 
coming along peacefully, or I'll put a bullet in your leg".

Jess stumbled through the door. Curt followed, reaching behind him 
to shut the door and hook it. Black would have little trouble getting 
out, but it might delay him a few minutes.   "Where're you 
takin' me"? Jess asked worriedly.   "We're going to 
Marshal Woods's house. Maybe if the marshal hears this himself, 
it'll make a difference. Somebody in this town must still have some 
backbone".

Over his shoulder he could see Max's loose grin and the Burnsides' 
glowering faces. "Honey", he whispered. "Soon as we 
send them on their way and make camp, let's you and me go for a walk 
down by the Snake- all by ourselves".   "Sally", admonished 
her mother, "you've got all evening to visit with Dan. His 
wounds need dressing now".   Mrs& Jackson's words recalled 
Dan to his lack of fitness for courting. What a spectacle he was, 
caked with dirt and sweat and blood, filthy as a pig and naked as an 
Indian, kissing the finest, the sweetest, the bravest, and absolutely 
the prettiest girl in this whole wonderful world. He released her reluctantly 
for her enthusiastic reunion with Old Hap. "Got a lot 
to tend to, but I'll get back quick as I can", he assured her.

Dan could hear Clayton Burnside and Eben Jackson summing up 
their final reckoning for rental on the oxen. Jackson was doing most 
of the talking. So long as Sally's pa was coming out best on the 
haggle, Dan didn't feel the need of putting in his two-bits' 
worth.

Soon as the Burnsides moved on, he'd lead Rex down by the 
river; there he could shave and scrub himself up for the evening. Damn 
it, he thought bitterly, picking up his shirt and staring at the fresh 
bullet hole in the sleeve. If I hadn't got Nate stopped when 
I did, my duds'd all be shot plumb to hell!   He stooped, 
picked up his ruined hat, and pursed his lips thoughtfully. From the 
way the wound in his head was itching, Dan knew that it would heal. 
But his only 
hat was something else again. "Nate! Nate"! he shouted.

The Burnsides, now ready to roll, were purposefully deaf to his 
cry.   "Nate"! he bellowed to the retreating back directly 
in front of him.   "I ain't going to fight you no more". 
Nate turned his head, attempting to speak in a soothing voice.

"I know you ain't"! Dan affirmed, feeling ten feet tall. 
He moved in close, jerked the handsome, broad-brimmed beaver hat from 
Nate's head and clamped it on his own. "Here's a present for 
you", he said, shoving his bullet-riddled hat down over Nate's purpling 
forehead. "Me and you's trading hats so's you'll have 
something permanent to remember me by"!   Sally left her choring 
to stand beside Dan. Slipping her hand in his, they silently watched 
the Burnsides make the bend in the road and disappear from sight. 
Much as they had to look forward to, they didn't begrudge a moment 
of the time they spent seeing them go.

AT FIRST Matilda 
could not believe her own eyes. She had spent too many hours looking 
ahead, hoping and longing to catch even a glimpse of Dan and finding 
nothing but emptiness. And now she could see him, looking uncommon 
handsome, standing there beside Sally Jackson and her folks in front 
of their trail-worn wagon.   Seeing them waiting there at the 
foot of Emigrant Rock was so overwhelming that, for a good minute 
after they rounded the bend and started down the grade leading toward 
them, Matilda could not speak at all. Then, with a glory that almost 
wiped out the deep, downward sags in her careworn face, Matilda leaned 
over the wheel and shouted to Hez, who was stumbling along in the 
heat and the dust on the opposite side of the wagon "Pa! Pa! 
I can see Dan. And he's with the Jacksons"!   "What 
about Burnsides"? Hez asked, who still believed they'd have them 
to lick.   "They ain't even in sight"! she replied.

By then Hez could see for himself, and so could the others. 
Soon they were all shouting greetings, exchanging smiles, and rejoicing 
to think that they were all back together again. But even a reunion 
as joyous as this one did not make a break in the routines of the day. 
Nor could they stop and find out about all that had happened until 
they made circle, tended the cattle, tethered the horses, gathered fuel, 
carried water, and started their cooking fires. Then, and only then, 
with the Jacksons and Dan as their true guests of honor, did the 
Harrows take time to catch up on the news. No sooner did they hear 
of Dan's injury than both Gran and Matilda went into immediate action. 
The wound in his scalp was examined, pronounced healing, and well 
doctored with simples, before they dished up the victuals. From then 
on, in keeping with the traditions they had followed since childhood, 
the whole group settled down to relish their food. Even Sally, in 
spite of her gaiety and obvious welcome, followed the old taboo of "quitting 
the gab when wearing the nosebag".   After their supper, 
the evening turned into a regular "Hoe-Down". Only, they 
carefully 
substituted old country folk dances for the Virginia Reels and 
square dances that were so popular among more worldly trains in the 
great westward migration. But with Bill O'Connor on the fiddle, 
and Gran Harrow exuberantly shouting "Glory Be" and "Hallelujah" 
above their united chant of the lilting old ballads, they played 
their quaint folk games with all the fervor and abandon of a real 
celebration.   "Golly", Rod exclaimed to Harmony as he dutifully 
stood by her side among the ringed spectators, "don't that 
fiddle make you wish the Bible didn't say us Baptists can't dance"?

"Nor Methodists, neither", she replied. "Not 
that 
it matters to me, being this far along".   Rod gave her a warm 
pat on the shoulder before he replied. "Come spring, you'll be 
kicking up your heels and feeling coltish again too, gal". 
At these words of sympathy and understanding, Harmony said generously, 
"I don't mind setting here along with Gran while you go out and 
join in the games".   Rod shifted his eager eyes from the milling 
group out in the circle long enough to reply, "I ain't much 
of a hand for Dare-Base and Farmer-in-the-Dell, but I'd sure
