Medicale aux Indigenes du Congo Belge (~FOREAMI) 
has special interest with respect to demography. This agency accepted 
responsibility for medical services to a population ranging from 
638,560 persons in 1941 to 840,503 in 1956 in the Kwango District 
and adjacent areas east of Leopoldville. Each year from 1941 on, its 
medical staff had conducted intensive field investigations to determine 
changes in population structure and vital rates and, as its primary 
objective, the incidence of major diseases. Its findings are reported 
each year in its <Rapport sur l'activite pendant annee> **h (Bruxelles). 
Somewhat similar investigations have been made by medical 
officers in other areas. Other independent, or partially independent 
agencies, have promoted investigations on topics directly or indirectly 
related to demography. These studies vary widely in scope and precision. 
L'Institut pour la Recherche Scientifique en Afrique Centrale 
(~IRSAC) has sponsored well-designed field investigations and has 
cooperated closely with the government of Ruanda-Urundi in the development 
of its official statistics.   A massive investigation 
of the characteristics of in-migrants and prospective out-migrants in 
Ruanda-Urundi is being carried on by J& J& Maquet, former Director 
of the Social Science branch of ~IRSAC, now a professor 
at l'Universite Officielle du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi. 
Some 30,000 completed schedules with 20 items (collected by sub-chiefs 
in 1,100 circumscriptions) have been tabulated. The results are 
now being analyzed.   Statistics have been recognized as a matter 
of strategic importance in the Congo and in Ruanda-Urundi during 
the post-war years in connection with long-term economic and social programs. 
The ~AIMO organizations of both countries, which maintain 
administrative services throughout the territories, retained immediate 
responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information. 
However, the statistical offices of both governments were 
assigned responsibility for the planning and analysis of these statistics. 
A Bureau de la Demographie (A& Romaniuk, Director) was formed 
under ~AIMO in the Congo, to work in close rapport with the 
Section Statistique of the Secretariat General. Eventually responsibility 
for demographic inquiries in the Congo was transferred to 
the demographic division of the Central Statistical Office. The 1952 
demographic inquiry in Ruanda-Urundi was directed by V& Neesen, 
a member of the ~IRSAC staff, though the inquiry was carried 
out under the auspices of ~AIMO, which has continuing responsibility 
for demographic statistics in this territory. A member of the 
~IRSAC staff (E& van de Walle) was recently delegated to cooperate 
with ~AIMO in the development of demographic statistics 
in this territory.   The initiation of sampling censuses in Ruanda-Urundi 
(1952) and in the Congo (1955-57) were major advances. We 
will deal first with the program in the Congo though this was put into 
operation later than the other.   The radical nature of the 
innovation in the Congo was not emphasized in the official announcements. 
The term <enquetes demographiques>, previously used for the supplementary 
investigations carried out in connection with the administrative 
censuses, was used for the new investigations. However, the differences 
in procedure are fundamental. These are as follows: _(1) 
FIELD WORK PROCEDURES:_ Field operations were transferred from 
administrative personnel primarily engaged in other tasks to specially 
trained teams 
of full-time African investigators (three teams, each working 
in two provinces). These teams carried out the same operations 
successively in different areas. _(2) NATURE OF THE SAMPLE:_ Sample 
areas in the new investigations were selected strictly by application 
of the principles of probability theory, so as to be representative 
of the total population of defined areas within calculable limits. 
In short, scientific sampling was introduced in place of subjective 
sampling. The populations of the various districts, or other major divisions, 
were stratified by type of community (rural, urban, mixed) and, 
where appropriate, by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy. Sample 
units (villages in rural areas, houses in cities) were drawn systematically 
within these strata. _(3) SIZE OF THE SAMPLE:_ Different 
sampling ratios were applied under different conditions. Higher 
proportions were sampled in urban and mixed communities than in rural 
areas. About 11 percent of the total population was covered in the new 
investigation, as compared with about 3 percent in the previous inquiries. 
_(4) QUESTIONS AND DEFINITIONS:_ Uniform questions, definitions, 
and procedures were enforced throughout the whole country. Data 
were obtained, separately, on three classes of persons: (a) residents, 
present; (b) residents, absent; and (c) visitors. In the 
reports, summary results are given for both the <de facto> (a and c) 
and <de jure> (a and b) populations; but the subsequent analysis 
of characteristics is reported only for the <de jure> population (or, 
in some districts, only the <de facto> population).   These 
changes represent in effect, a shift from (1) an administrative compilation 
of data obtained through procedures designed primarily to serve 
political and economic objectives to (2) a systematic sampling census 
of the whole African population.   The population registration 
system still has important functions. It supplies local data which are 
useful in administration and which can be used as a basis for intensive 
studies in particular situations. It provides a frame for the sampling 
census. It also provides a frame within which the registration 
of vital events is gradually gaining force (though one cannot expect to 
obtain reliable vital statistics in most parts of the Congo from this 
source in the near future). It is still used in making current population 
estimates in post-census years, though the value of these estimates 
is open to question. Finally, it may have certain very important, 
less obvious values. Even though the registers may have an incomplete 
record of persons present in a particular area or include persons 
no longer living there, they contain precise information on ages, by date 
of birth, for some of the persons present (especially children in 
relatively stable communities) and supplementary information (such as 
records of marital status) for many others. The quality of the census 
data can, therefore, be greatly improved by the use of the registration 
records in conjunction with the field inquiries. Furthermore, it may 
be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method (as distinguished 
from sampling error) in each of these sources, on such subjects 
as fertility, mortality, and migration during a given interval by using 
information from two largely independent sources in conjunction.

The first sampling census in the Congo extended over a three-year 
period, 1955-57; the results were still being processed in 1959. 
It is planned to double the number of teams and to make use of improved 
equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960, so that the inquiry 
can be carried through in one year and the results published more 
expeditiously. It is proposed that in the future complete sampling censuses 
be carried out at five-year intervals.   Reports already 
issued on the sampling census, 1955-57, in various areas run as follows 
(using only the French and omitting corresponding Flemish titles): 
@.   This report contains preliminary notes and 35 tables.

Other reports in identical form, but with somewhat varying content, 
have been issued for: @.   These area reports will be 
followed, according to present plans, by a summary report, which will 
include a detailed statement on methods.

With this evidence in mind, the writer began to plan how he might 
more effectively educate the married students in his functional classes. 
Toward the end of the semester's work, he interviewed every 
married class member at great length. He found, as he had suspected, 
a 
general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally designed 
course was not really functional for these students. However, 
all admitted that the "hind sight" was not altogether lost. In their 
own words, it had aided them to get a clearer picture of how they 
had gotten into their marriages, and perhaps they had obtained some 
insights on why certain troubles appeared from time to time. In fact, 
they went so far as to caution the writer that if he attempted to design 
a section <exclusively> for married students there should be, at 
the beginning, some "hind sight" study; but they all hastened to 
add that certainly less time was needed on it than presently spent. 
All of them felt a compelling need for more coverage on areas that could 
be only lightly touched upon in a general survey functional course.

A few were doubtful about the merits of an exclusive section 
for married students. As one of them expressed it, "It has done me 
a world of good to listen to the nai^ve questions and comments of 
these not-yet-married people. I can now better see just what processes 
provoked certain actions from me in the past. Had I been in an all-married 
section I would have missed this, and I believe that this single 
aspect has been of great personal value to me". This comment 
and others similar to it, would seem to indicate a possible justification 
for continuing the status quo. But the weight of feeling was heavily 
in the opposite direction. Thus, the writer decided to hold one experimental 
section of the functional preparation for marriage course 
in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for persons already married- 
that is, prerequisite: "marriage". This did not mean that married 
students could not enroll in other "mixed" sections, and some 
of them, largely because of scheduling difficulties, did. But only 
those already married could enroll in this one section. In addition, 
two other differences in the two types of sections must be noted. 1) 
The regular sections do not allow freshmen; this one did. This action 
was rationalized on the basis of a small survey which indicated that 
a high percentage of married freshmen women on our campus never become 
sophomores. Many of them appear to drop out, for one reason or another. 
By permitting freshman students we might extend the opportunity 
for such a course to some individuals who otherwise might never get 
to take it. This has subsequently been verified by the experience. 2) 
Auditors were encouraged. In the regular sections they have always 
been more or less discouraged. The philosophy has been that if they could 
find the time to attend class why not encourage them to get the credit 
and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively. 
Besides, auditors do not count on faculty load with the same weight 
as regularly enrolled students. But in this one section we welcomed 
auditors. Why? For no particular reason, other than that the writer 
felt it might- just might- encourage both mates to be in attendance. 
Many of the men on our campus have a pretty set curriculum, especially 
in the various engineering fields, with few electives till the senior 
year. Incidentally, it needs to be noted that because auditors were 
permitted the section began increasing in numbers each week, until 
at last it swelled to such proportions that this "free" auditing 
policy had to be retracted. After that, we began to get "visitors" 
to class.   This experimental class represented quite a variety 
of students. It ranged from a freshman woman, just married, through 
the various academic growth stages, including one senior-graduate student, 
to a young faculty member recently married to a senior man who also 
attended. It ranged from those with no children, through students 
in various stages of pregnancy, to one 44-year-old male with four children, 
three of whom were teenagers. It ranged from two women members 
who had experienced premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve years married 
and seemingly unable to conceive.   One might digress at 
this point and speculate that if it is "wise" to create special sections 
for special status, then why not a special section for women pregnant 
before marriage, and one for 44-year-old men with teenage children, 
and so on. Some of these speculations may have some merit, others 
are somewhat ambiguous. But few who have experienced marriage can dispute 
the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationships is different 
<in> marriage than in a pre-marital situation.   The writer 
began this special class by explaining his background thinking for 
creating such a section in the first place. He made it clear from the 
beginning that this was the students' opportunity, and that the future 
destiny of such groups depended on favorable results from this one. 
He <did> build a framework of academic "respectability", and one 
which did not encroach upon the "sacred sovereignty" of any other 
existing campus course. This is to say that this was not a course 
in wise buying or money spending methods, nor a course in how to raise
