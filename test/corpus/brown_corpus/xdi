Latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing 
dates well back into the nineteenth century in England, much ahead 
of similar revivals in other countries. As a result no comparable 
literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more 
often performed than the English madrigal.   Naturally, Mr& 
Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant 
when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their 
countrymen: William Byrd, Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins. 
There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing, with a tendency 
to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture. 
Both techniques give the music purity and clarity.   Claude 
Jannequin's vocal description of a battle (the French equivalents 
of tarantara, rum-tum-tum, and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque) is 
lots of fun, and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other 
chansons by Jannequin and Lassus. Only with the more sensual, intense 
and baroque expressions of Marenzio, Monteverdi and Gesualdo 
does the singing seem a little superficial.   Nevertheless, the 
musicality, accuracy and infectious charm of these performances, excellently 
reproduced, make it an attractive look-see at the period. The 
works are presented chronologically. Texts and translations are provided. 

#ELEGANCE AND COLOR#

The elements of elegance and color in Jannequin 
are strong French characteristics. Baroque instrumental music 
in Italy and Germany tends to be strong, lively, intense, controlled 
and quite abstract. In France, it remained always more picturesque, 
more dancelike, more full of flavor.   Couperin and Rameau 
gave titles to nearly everything they wrote, not in the later sense 
of "program music" but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close, 
clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.

Both composers turn up on new imports from France. ~BAM 
is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is 
Editions de la boite a musique. They specialize in out-of-the-way 
items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention. 
{Sonates et Concerts Royaux} of Couperin le grand occupy 
two disks (~LD056 and ~LD060) and reveal the impeccable taste 
and workmanship of this master- delicate, flexible and gemlike.

The Concerts- Nos& 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 are represented- 
are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian 
sense. The sonatas, "La Francaise", "La Sultane", "L'Astree" 
and "L'Imperiale", are often more elaborately worked 
out and, in fact, show a strong Italian influence.   Couperin 
also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk 
called {Musique Francaise du /18,e Siecle} (~BAM ~LD 
060). Jean-Marie LeClair still is remembered a bit, but Bodin de 
Beismortier, Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words. 
What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal 
the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo.

The Couperin "La Steinkerque", with its battle music, brevity, 
wit and refined simplicity, already shakes off Corelli and points 
towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era. If 
Couperin shows the fashionable trend, the others do so all the more.

All these records have close, attractive sound and the performances 
by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic.   Rameau's 
{Six Concerts en Sextuor,} recorded by L'orchestre de 
chambre Pierre Menet (~BAM ~LD 046), turn out to be harpsichord 
pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself. 
The strange, delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes 
inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious.   {Maitres 
Allemands des /17,e et /18,e Siecles} contains music 
by Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Rosenmueller and Telemann, well performed 
by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket (~BAM ~LD 
035).

Rococo music- a lot of it- was played in Carnegie Recital 
Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored 
this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts.

Works by J& C& Bach, Anton Craft, Joseph Haydn, Giuseppe 
Sammartini, Comenico Dragonetti and J& G& Janitsch were 
performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff, flutist, 
Josef Marx, oboist, and Robert Conant, pianist and harpsichordist.

Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all, 
it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown 
accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven 
to Boulez.   Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century 
charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday 
night. Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program, 
but taken together they grew quite tiresome.   The performances 
were variable, those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying, 
some by soloists proving rather trying. @

Ellie Mao, soprano, and Frederick Fuller, baritone, presented 
a program of folksongs entitled "East Meets West" in Carnegie 
Recital Hall last night. They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee, 
pianist.   Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos 
and duets in a broad range of languages. Songs from China and Japan 
were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao, who is a native of China, 
and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr& Fuller, who is 
English by birth.   This was not a program intended to illustrate 
authentic folk styles. On the contrary, Miss Mao and Mr& Fuller 
chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such 
as Mendelssohn, Dvorak, Canteloube, Copland and Britten. Thre 
was, 
therefore, more musical substance in the concert than might have been 
the case otherwise. The performances were assured, communicative and 
pleasingly informal. @

WHAT was omitted from "A Neglected Education" were 
those essentials known as "the facts of life".   Chabrier's 
little one-act operetta, presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall, 
is a fragile, precious little piece, very French, not without wit 
and charm. The poor uneducated newlywed, a certain Gontran de Boismassif, 
has his problems in getting the necessary information. The humor 
of the situation can be imagined.   It all takes place in the 
eighteenth century. What a silly, artificial way of life, Chabrier 
and his librettists chuckle. But they wish they could bring it back. 
#@#

Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where 
the classical, rationalist tradition, (handed down to Chabrier largely 
in the form of operetta and salon music) becomes virtually neo-classicism. 
The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste 
and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or 
mawkish.   The simple, clever production was also able to tread 
the thin line between those extremes. Arlene Saunders was charming as 
poor Gontran. Yes, Arlene is her name; the work uses the old eighteenth-century 
tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced 
youth to a soprano. Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife 
and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.

The work was presented as the final event in the Town 
Hall Festival of Music. It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera, 
"The Poor Sailor", set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau, a 
kind of Grand Guignol by the sea, a sailor returns, unrecognized, and 
gets done in by his wife.   With the exception of a few spots, 
Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties, 
odd harmonies, and lumbering, satiric orchestration.

Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon. Sat there 
and as a woman sang, she kept getting thinner and thinner, right 
before my eyes, and the eyes of some 5,500 other people.   I make 
this observation about the lady, Miss Judy Garland, because she brought 
up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female 
reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote 
in the paper the next day:   "Judy Garland has arrived 
in London. She's not chubby. She's not plump. She's fat".

But who cares, when the lady sings? Certainly not the largest 
afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the 
most attentive and quiet. They applauded every number, not only at its 
conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme- sometimes 
at the first chord.   And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things 
which seemed, at times, a blessed relief from the way-out compositions 
of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings. 
Things like "When You're Smiling", "Almost Like Being In 
Love", "Do It Again", "Born to Wander", "Alone Together", 
"Who Cares?", "Puttin' on the Ritz", "How 
Long Has This Been Going On?" and her own personal songs 
like "The Man That Got Away", and the inevitable "Over the 
Rainbow".   Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers 
of our time but she is one of the superb showmen. At the start of 
her program there were evidences of pique. She had held to the letter 
of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 
p&m&, the appointed hour, although the Music at Newport people had 
tried to get the program underway at 3. Then there was a bad delay 
in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs.

Along about 4:30, just when it was getting to be about time 
to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side, Judy 
came on singing, in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket 
that flapped in the wind. Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately 
combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk 
breeze was blowing.   In her first song she waved away one 
encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter 
the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm& lenses 
and shoot at extreme range.   There also came a brief contretemps 
with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during 
a quiet moment near the conclusion of "Do It Again", and 
she made the tart observation that "I never saw so much moving about 
in an audience".   But it didn't take Judy Garland, showman, 
long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at 
Newport and that you have to learn to live with it. Before her chore 
was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music, trundling 
microphones about the stage, helping to move the piano and otherwise joining 
in the informal atmosphere.   And time after time she really 
belted out her songs. Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged- 
which was the way I felt about her "Come Rain or Come 
Shine"- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent, like her 
shatteringly beautiful "Beautiful Weather".   To her partisan 
audience, such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than 
a critic striving to hold his franchise; they just sat back on their 
haunches and cried for more, as though they could never get enough.

They were rewarded with splendid, exciting, singing. Her "Rockabye 
Your Baby" was as good as it can be done, and her really 
personal songs, like "The Man That Got Away" were deeply moving.

The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard 
"Over The Rainbow"- although the fellow that kept crying for 
"Get Happy" had to go home unhappy, about that item anyway. She 
was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with 
its cheers and applause and flowers.   All went home happy except 
the Newport police, who feared that the throng departing at 6:35
