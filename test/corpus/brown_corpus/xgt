milk was another cure for burns, and burns covered with gum arabic or 
plain mucilage healed quickly. One man, badly burned about the face and 
eyes by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not find a doctor 
at the time. A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings, 
which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the "heat". 
Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns. The results 
were good, but which treatment helped is still not known.   To 
stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds. One old-timer 
said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut, even when on a knuckle, if it 
was made by a rusty tool; this would stop the flow and also prevent 
infection. My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy 
for cuts and wounds; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury 
and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth, over which she poured 
turpentine. He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically 
amputated and which his mother had treated; there is scarcely a scar 
showing. Tobacco was common first aid. A "chaw" of tobacco put 
on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing. Or a thin slice 
of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing. One 
old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a 
fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his 
head. His brother ran a mile to get the father; when they reached 
the boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the scalp back 
in place, and covered the raw edges with the slices. Then he put a rag 
around the dressing to keep it in place. There was no cleaning or further 
care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no 
scar. Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding, 
and rue was an antiseptic. Until quite recently, "sterile" maggots 
could be bought to apply to a wound; they would feed on its surface, 
leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.   Tetanus 
could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound. One family 
bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips, or, if these were not 
handy, plain lard. Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the 
wounded foot or hand in the smoke. Rabies were cured or prevented 
by "madstones" which the pioneer wore or carried. In 1872 there were 
known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the 
family for 200 years. Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds, 
then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.   While nowadays 
we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at 
the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had 
little 
variation. Since a fall or blow might have caused it, a cold pack 
was usually first aid. This might be applied to the top of the nose 
or the back of the neck, pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the 
nostril (cotton was usually used in this last). Nosebleed could be 
stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and 
tying in it a knot for each year of his life. Or the victim could chew 
hard on a piece of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in 
his ears.   Old sores could be healed by the constant application 
of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water. Blood blisters could 
be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with 
any hard nonpoisonous substance. Felons were cured by taking common 
salt and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing it with equal 
parts of spirits of turpentine; this mixture was then spread on 
a cloth and wrapped around the affected part. As the cloth dried, more 
of the mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the felon was 
supposed to be "killed".   Insect bites were cured in many 
ways. Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method; "get a bite, 
spit on it" was a proverb. This was used also for bruises. Yellow 
clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings; 
not long ago "Denver Mud" was most popular. Chiggers were a 
common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived; so 
small as to be scarcely visible to the eye, they buried themselves in 
the victim's flesh. Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief 
and also killed the pests. Ant bites were eased by applying liquid 
bluing. For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half 
a glass of soda was made. For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by 
scraping an onion, gave quick relief. A handier remedy was to bathe the 
painful part in strong soapy water; mud was sometimes used as well 
as soap. Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve 
wasp or bee stings.   Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days; 
to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore. Bed 
slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were placed in cups 
of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate, 
applied with a feather. Kerosene was very effective in ridding 
pioneer homes of the pests. At times pioneer children got lice in their 
hair. A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment, but it did the 
job.   To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should 
be inserted. A cinder or other small object could be removed from the 
eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye. As the seed swelled its glutinous 
covering protected the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder 
and the seed could soon be washed out. Another way to remove small 
objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed; the particle 
would then move toward the nose, where it could be wiped out with 
a wisp of cotton.   Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug, 
used in combinations. For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and 
one 
ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth. Itching 
skin, considered "just nerves", was eased by treating with 
whiskey and salt. Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider 
in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped. To cure fungus growths 
on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of 
sassafras bark in a quart of water. They drank half a cup of this morning 
and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same 
solution. Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and 
had defied other remedies. Frostbite was treated by putting the feet 
and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow. Now one hears that 
heat and hot water are used instead. Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus, 
used as well for chilblains. Chilblains were also treated with 
tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.   Boils have always been 
a source of much trouble. A German informant gave me a sure cure 
made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice. Another poultice 
was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped in water 
until it formed a sticky, gummy solution. This was also used for sores. 
Another frequent pioneer difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy 
shoes and boots, was corns. One veracious woman tells me she has 
used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they 
remove the pain or "fire". Another common cure was to soak the 
feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of 
equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight. 
This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed 
the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.

There were many cures for warts. One young girl told me how her 
mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in 
vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several 
times. Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a 
bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the 
house for seven days. Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's 
sleep was considered poisonous; wetting a wart with this saliva on 
wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear 
after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did 
just that. One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy. 
Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie 
it on the wart, and wear it for a week. A simpler method was to tie 
a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way. I 
know this worked. One person recommended to me washing the wart with 
sulphur water; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato 
three times daily. Another common method was to cut an onion in two and 
place each half on the wart for a moment; the onion was then fastened 
together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave. As the 
onion decayed, so did the wart.   Sore muscles were relieved by 
an arnica rub; sore feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's 
ubiquitous herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water 
in which two cups of salt had been dissolved. Leg cramps, one person 
tells me, were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the 
body on the heel and pressing down hard. This does give relief, as I 
can testify. One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy 
before each meal for leg cramps. Pains in the back of the leg and in 
the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope 
about the patient's waist.   For sprains and swellings, one 
pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added 
to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.

EXCEPT FOR the wine waiter in a restaurant- always an inscrutable 
plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock 
the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper 
or <negociant> who in turn supplies him. In instances where 
both of these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation is ideal. 
It may, on occasion, be anything but that. However, by cultivating 
a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain 
whether he has any knowledge of wines (as opposed to what he may 
have been told by salesmen and promoters) and, better yet, whether he 
has a taste for wine. Again, by spreading one's purchases over several 
wine dealers, one becomes familiar with the names and specialties 
of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad. This is important because, 
despite all the efforts of the French government, an appreciable 
segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a 
misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many 
too many <negociants> who would rather turn a <sou> than amass a 
creditable reputation overseas.   A good <negociant> or shipper 
will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from 
the best vineyards, or the best parts of them; he may also be the 
one who makes and bottles the best blends- sound wines from vineyards 
generally in his own district. These are the wines the French themselves 
use for everyday drinking, for even in France virtually no one 
drinks the <Grands Crus> on a meal-to-meal basis. The <Grands 
Crus> are expensive, and even doting palates tire of them. And certainly, 
in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine 
drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready 
for the <Grands Crus> as a steady diet without frequent recourse 
to <crus> of less renown. There is nothing <infra dig> about a 
good blend from a good shipper. Some of them are very delicious indeed, 
and there are many good ones exported- unfortunately, along with 
others not so good, and worse. Consultation with a reputable wine dealer 
and constant experimentation- "steering ever from the known to 
the unknown"- are the requisites.   Wine waiters are something 
else again; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great 
deal, their importance mounts. Most of them, the world over, operate 
on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and 
some other Latin countries: the customer is to be considered guilty 
of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof 
on the customer himself. Now the drinking of wine (and happily so!) 
is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly, if everyone 
in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them, the 
supply would dry up in no time at all. This is the only valid, and extenuating, 
argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible 
attitude of the common wine waiter. A really good wine waiter is, 
paradoxically, the guardian (and not the purveyor) of his cellar against 
the Visigoths. Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible 
supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped 
with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine 
waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence. The one way to 
get around them- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking 
to it- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter 
is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending 
money. Only then, perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.

Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest 
for several weeks before it is served. This is especially true of 
red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well
