given priority in the basic list as long as they continue to show these 
qualities.   With the universal list as his weapon, Swadesh 
has 
extended his march of conquest farther and farther into the past, eight, 
ten, twelve millennia back. And he has proclaimed greater or less 
affiliation between all Western hemisphere languages. Some of this 
may prove to be true, or even considerable of it, whether by genetic 
ramification or by diffusion and coalescence. But the farther out he 
moves, the thinner will be his hold on conclusive evidence, and the larger 
the speculative component in his inferences. He has traversed provinces 
and kingdoms, but he has not consolidated them behind him, nor 
does he control them. He has announced results on Hokan, Penutian, 
Uto-Aztecan, and almost all other American families and phyla, and 
has diagrammed their degree of interrelation; but he has not worked 
out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of 
even a single family other than Salish. That is his privilege. The 
remote, cloudy, possible has values of its own- values of scope, 
stimulus, potential, and imagination. But there is also a firm aspect 
to lexicostatistics: the aspect of learning the internal organization 
of obvious natural genetic groups of languages as well as their more 
remote and elusive external links; of classification first, with elapsed 
age merely a by-product; of acquiring evidential knowledge of 
what happened in Athabascan, in Yokuts, in Uto-Aztecan in the last 
few thousand years as well as forecasting what more anciently may have 
happened between them. This involves step-by-step progress, and such 
will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics as a growing 
body of scientific inquiry. If of the founders of glottochronology 
Swadesh has escaped our steady plodding, and Lees has repudiated his 
own share in the founding, that is no reason why we should swerve. 

#8.# 

There is no apparent reason why we should feel bound by Swadesh's 
rules and procedure since his predilections and aims have grown 
so vast. It seems time to consider a revision of operational procedures 
for lexicostatistic studies on a more humble, solid, and limited basis.

I would propose, first, an abandonment of attempts at a 
universal lexical list, as intrinsically unachievable, and operationally 
inadequate in proportion as it is achieved.   I would propose, 
next, as the prime requirement for constitution of new basic lists, 
items whose forms show as high an empirical retention rate as possible. 
There would be no conceivable sense in going to the opposite extreme 
of selecting items whose forms are the most unstable. An attempted 
middle course might lead to devices like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary 
from which every fiftieth word was selected.

Doubtless it was inevitable that differences of opinion should 
arise about the methods for applying these policies. It was nevertheless 
almost incredible that four years after Yalta there should be a 
complete split over Germany, with hot heads on both sides planning to 
use the Germans against their former allies, and with Nazi-minded Germans 
expecting to recover their power by fighting on one side or the 
other. 

#5. POLAND#

_FRONTIERS._ When the Yalta Conference 
opened, the American policy of postponing all discussion of Russia's 
western boundaries until the peace conference had broken down. Starting 
in great force late in December, from a line stretching from 
East Prussia to Budapest, the Red armies had swept two hundred miles 
across Poland to the Oder, thirty miles from Berlin, and the Upper 
Danube region was being rapidly overrun, while the Western Allies 
had not yet occupied all of the left bank of the Rhine. The long 
delay in opening the Second Front was now working to Russia's advantage.

The West was now glad to propose the 1919 Curzon Line, 
which was substantially Russia's 1941 border, as the boundary between 
Russia and Poland. When this proposal was made, Stalin spoke 
with stronger emotion than at any other time during the Conference. 
He stood up to emphasize his strong feeling on the subject. The bitter 
memory of Russia's exclusion from the Paris Peace Conference 
and of the West's effort to stamp out Bolshevism at its birth boiled 
up within him. "You would drive us into shame", he declared. 
The White Russians and the Ukrainians would say that Stalin and Molotov 
were far less reliable defenders of Russia than Curzon and Clemenceau.

Yet after long and earnest discussion Stalin accepted 
the Curzon Line and even agreed voluntarily that there should be 
digressions from that line of five to eight kilometers in favor of Poland 
in some regions. He did not mind the Line itself, which Churchill 
declared in the House of Commons, on February 27, 1945, he had 
always believed to be "just and right", but he did not want it called 
by a hated name. The West had long since forgotten the events 
of 1919, but it was not so easy for the Red leaders, who felt that they 
had suffered great injustice in that period.   In the Dunn-Atherton 
memorandum of February 4, 1942, the State Department had expected 
to be able to hold Russia in check by withholding agreement to 
her 1941 boundaries. Now Stalin made it clear that he meant to move 
Poland's western borders deep into Germany, back to the western 
Neisse-Oder River lines, taking not only East Prussia and all of 
Silesia but Pomerania and the tip of Brandenburg, back to and including 
Stettin. From six to nine million additional Germans would be 
evicted, though most would have fled, and Poland would receive far more 
from Germany than the poor territories, including the great Pripet 
Marshes, which she lost to Russia. Stalin declared that he preferred 
to continue the war a little longer, "although it costs us blood", 
in order to give Poland compensation in the West at the expense 
of the Germans.   By this time Churchill was not so cordial toward 
moving Poland westward as he had been at Teheran, where he and 
Eden had both heartily approved the idea. After "a prolonged study 
of the Oder line on a map", at Teheran, Churchill "liked the 
picture". He would tell the Poles, he said, that they had been "given 
a fine place to live in, more than three hundred miles each way". 
At Yalta he thought more about the six million Germans who would 
have to leave, trying to find work in Germany, and Roosevelt objected 
to the Western Neisse River being chosen in the south, instead 
of the Eastern Neisse, both of which flow into the Oder.   The 
issue was left in abeyance, presumably for the peace conference. However, 
there was no real question of the justice of creating a strong 
Poland, both industrially and agriculturally, and one unplagued by large 
minorities of Germans or Russians. The moving of millions of the 
German master-race, from the very heart of Junkerdom, to make room 
for the Polish Slavs whom they had enslaved and openly planned to exterminate 
was a drastic operation, but there was little doubt that it 
was historically justified. _GOVERNMENT._ Of more importance to 
the West than Poland's boundaries was the character of her government. 
At Yalta the West still believed that Eastern Europe could 
be kept in its orbit, in spite of the onrushing Soviet armies. Though 
little democracy had ever been practised in this region, and much of 
it was still ruled by feudalistic means, it was taken for granted that 
at least the forms of Western democracy would be established in this 
area and Western capitalism preserved within it. Believing devoutly 
as they did in Anglo-Saxon institutions, it was important to both 
Roosevelt and Churchill that the Poles should have them.   The 
issue was acute because the exiled Polish Government in London, supported 
in the main by Britain, was still competing with the new Lublin 
Government formed behind the Red Army. More time was spent in 
trying to marry these imcompatibles than over any subject discussed at 
Yalta. The result was an agreement that the Lublin Government should 
be "reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion 
of democratic leaders from Poland itself and from the Poles abroad", 
and pledged to hold "free and unfettered elections as soon as possible 
on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot". All 
"democratic and anti-Nazi parties" were to have the right to campaign.

Roosevelt acted as moderator of the long debate on this 
issue. It was a matter of principle with Churchill, since Britain had 
declared war in behalf of Poland. To Stalin it was a matter of 
life and death. He made this completely clear. Speaking with "great 
earnestness", he said: "For the Russian people, the question 
of Poland is not only a question of honor but also a question of security. 
Throughout history, Poland has been the corridor through which 
the enemy has passed into Russia. Twice in the last thirty years our 
enemies, the Germans, have passed through this corridor. It is in 
Russia's interest that Poland should be strong and powerful, in a 
position to shut the door of this corridor by her own force **h. It 
is necessary that Poland should be free, independent in power. Therefore, 
it is not only a question of honor but of life and death for the 
Soviet state".   In other words, the Soviet Union was determined 
to create a Poland so strong as to be a powerful bulwark against 
Germany and so closely tied to Russia that there would never be any 
question of her serving as a <cordon sanitaire> against the Soviets 
or posing as an independent, balancing power in between Russia and 
Germany. Byrnes says that invariably thereafter the Soviets used 
the same security argument to justify their course in Poland. This reasoning 
was also as inevitable as anything could be. Any free elections 
that were to be held in Poland would have to produce a government 
in which Moscow had complete confidence, and all pressure from the West 
for free voting by anti-Soviet elements in Poland would be met 
by 
restrictions on voting by these elements. 

#6. LIBERATED EUROPE# 

In even greater degree the same rule applied to the remainder of Eastern 
Europe, where the upper classes had generally collaborated with 
the Nazis, even to the extent of sending millions of their peasants into 
Russia as a part of Hitler's armies. But at Yalta the conflicting 
expectations of East and West were merged into an agreement by 
the Big Three to assist all liberated countries in Europe "to 
create 
democratic institutions of their own choice". In any case "<where 
in their judgment conditions require>" [italics added] they 
would "form interim governmental authorities broadly representative 
of all democratic elements in the population and pledged to the earliest 
possible establishment through free elections of governments responsive 
to the will of the people". Other similar affirmations in the 
Declaration on Liberated Europe seemed to assure democratic institutions 
on the Western model. Later it developed that the Soviets had 
a very different interpretation of democracy, which will be discussed 
later, and their judgment never told them that the Big Three should 
unite in establishing democratic conditions, as we understand them, 
within their zone of influence.   Professor McNeill thinks that 
at Yalta, Stalin did not fully realize the dilemma which faced him, 
that he thought the exclusion of the anti-Soviet voters from East 
European 
elections would not be greatly resented by his allies, while 
neither Roosevelt nor Churchill frankly faced "the fact that, in Poland 
at least, genuinely free democratic elections would return governments 
unfriendly to Russia", by any definition of international friendliness. 
Also war-time propaganda and cooperation had "obscured 
the differences between Russian and Western ideas of democracy", 
and it seemed better to have them covered by verbal formulae than to imperil 
the military victories over Germany and Japan.   The application 
of these formulae could not please both sides, for they really 
attempted to marry the impossible to the inevitable. While obliged 
to concede governments in East Europe allied with the Soviet Union 
instead of opposed to it, we thought we had preserved our social and
