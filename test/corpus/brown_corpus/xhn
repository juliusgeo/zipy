including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what 
to say. There seemed to be no excuse? I don't have the answer 
yet.   We had tea at Mr& Washizu's home where I learned 
that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family. His grandfather is 
a Buddhist priest; and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest, 
but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become 
the priest. This is a significant fact in Japan, for only a few 
years ago he would have had no choice. In his big home live four families 
and thirty people, so it needs to be big. Also, there are housed 
here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old- 
paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc&. He had displayed more of them 
than usual so that I could enjoy them. About 100 of the most important 
items he had already given to the museum. The house itself is 400 
years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried times. 

#NARA, 
OSAKA, AND HIROSHIMA#

Mr& Nishima went with me on the train 
to Nara. We passed his house and school on the way. In Nara I 
stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their 
honeymoon. A new red carpet had been laid for their coming, but I 
walked on it, too. Here Mr& Yoneda met us after a three-hour train 
trip from the town where he teaches. Even though we had walked miles 
in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.

In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles 
to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima. Again the plan was 
for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me. At Osaka, Mr& Yoneda 
had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr& Nishima 
and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night. 
It is the second largest city in Japan, with about four million people. 
One spot in Osaka I shall always remember- the bridge where 
we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the 
still waters of the river. In the midst of a great busy city, people 
take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.

My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 
a&m&. I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little, 
after which Mr& Uno would arrive and pilot me around. But there 
he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.

I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even 
when I told them I didn't want to. They knew that I was still grieving 
over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the 
recovery 
and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also 
regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better 
a new Japan. There were no words to say this but there was no need.

The teachers of Mr& Uno's school gave me a small gift 
to thank me for coming. Hiroshima is a better city than it was before- 
in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace 
and understanding. I was grateful for their insight into my need 
for this experience. A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima. 

#TOKYO#

On arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took 
us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University. 
This day was "Open House for Parents" day, and the girls were 
busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables. Everything was in 
an exciting turmoil- full of anticipation and fun.   It was 
thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese 
students in a class in Home Planning. Our Masu is one of the very 
few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family 
functions and women's needs. I am told the time will soon come when 
women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now 
it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants. Many 
of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American 
homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese 
artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the 
Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.   At this Women's 
University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed 
that Japanese women also should be educated. Even today there are 
some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this 
University continues to grow and to send its students out into the 
community. Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus 
where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they 
can have their social gatherings and professional meetings. As far 
as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the 
creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found 
by educated women unafraid to break traditions.   Masu is also 
teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo. 
Here the women learn to keep house as maids; they become skilled 
in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests. They learn how 
to take care of children and sick members of the family. They have model 
kitchens, a sick room with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with 
a life-like doll. Although the training is only for one month, it 
is intensive and thorough. Graduates of this maid's school are much 
in demand and can always find work immediately. Occasionally they return 
for additional training. Masu's home economics training comes 
into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for 
the storage of cleaning materials. Masu also uses the training she got 
in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, 
and work effectively in keeping a shiny house. Her education in 
the United States, not just in a classroom, but also in an American 
house with an American housekeeper, stands her in good stead. 

#UNIVERSITY 
OF TOKYO#

After a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen 
of which Masu had planned, Mr& Washizu and I left to meet representatives 
of the ~USIS for a visit to the University of Tokyo. 
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could 
not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous 
in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant. 
The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only 
by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following 
consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads 
of certain national chain stores should, of course, be applauded. But 
for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of 
a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts 
contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case. The suppositions 
in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing 
a connection between general company practice and local practice 
in the South, and by establishing such direct connection between the 
practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York 
and general company policy. Then the boycott would not be secondary, 
but a primary one. It would be directed against the actual location of 
the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice, 
must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury 
of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy. Perhaps 
this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire 
national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire 
economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores 
in the matter of segregation. Such a general boycott might still be a 
blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable 
justification. 
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove 
most decisive and is most clearly legitimate. Moreover, prudence alone 
would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to 
fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon 
national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage 
to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to 
greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even 
(as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure 
to correct injustice) to its going out of business in certain sections 
of the country (as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many 
meetings in the pre-Civil War South, largely went out of business 
in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover 
a large number of southern adherents).   In any case, anyone who 
fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary 
applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified 
that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years 
ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils 
in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer 
in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a 
national ~TV network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed, 
a "high yellow gal" smooching with a white man. It is true, 
of course, that the end or objective of this action was different. But 
since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals 
and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where 
direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the 
matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not 
effectively present, there has to be a <morality of means> applied in 
every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures 
or other forms of force.   the need that we not give unqualified 
approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed 
against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the 
fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation 
mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical 
violence. An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically 
opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow 
humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously 
brutal means. The end or aim of the action, of course, is also 
important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community 
customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person 
from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e&g&, against 
Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the 
present moment. Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance 
to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies. This, however, 
is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and 
economic conflict (if both sides are strong enough) can be war of all 
against all no less than if other means are used. It is also sufficient 
to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs 
to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his <conduct> 
is just, i&e&, that, if economic pressure has to be resorted 
to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the 
way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while, 
if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily 
(however inevitably) and not by deliberate intent and direct 
action against them.   It is clear that non-violent resistance is 
a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian 
morality, like any other form of resistance. The <language> used 
itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle 
for victory (perhaps to be chosen above all others). One of the sit-in 
leaders has said: "Nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom 
of Hell can stop the march to freedom. Everybody in the world today 
might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom 
is going to march over them". The present writer certainly agrees 
with that statement, and would also affirm this- in the order of justice. 
However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity 
interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches 
forward. And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice 
and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental 
good will. It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained 
above, and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent 
means.
