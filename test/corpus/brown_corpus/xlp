caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential 
times the volume, just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic 
pressure head. If the volume is the molal volume, then **f is obtained 
on a molal basis which is the customary terminology of the chemists.

Although the **f calculation is obvious by analogy with that 
for gravitational field and osmotic pressure, it is interesting to confirm 
it by a method which can be generalized to include related effects. 
Consider a shear field with a height of ~<H> and a cross-sectional 
area of ~<A> opposed by a manometer with a height of ~<h> 
(referred to the same base as ~<H>) and a cross-sectional area 
of ~<a>. If **f is the change per unit volume in Gibbs function 
caused by the shear field at constant ~<P> and ~<T>, and ~|r 
is the density of the fluid, then the total potential energy of 
the system above the reference height is **f. **f is the work necessary 
to fill the manometer column from the reference height to ~<h>. 
The total volume of the system above the reference height is **f, and 
~<h> can be eliminated to obtain an equation for the total potential 
energy of the system in terms of ~<H>. The minimum total potential 
energy is found by taking the derivative with respect to ~<H> 
and equating to zero. This gives **f, which is the pressure. This 
is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum 
Gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential 
energy for equilibrium. This method can be extended to include the 
concentration differences caused by shear fields. The relation between 
osmotic pressure and the Gibbs function may also be developed in an 
analogous way.   In the above development we have applied the thermodynamics 
of equilibrium (referred to by some as thermostatics) to 
the steady state. This can be justified thermodynamically in this case, 
and this will be done in a separate paper which is being prepared. 
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption stated by Philippoff 
that "the deformational mechanics of <elastic solids> can be 
applied to flowing solutions". There is one exception to the above 
statement as has been pointed out, and that is that fluids can relax 
by flowing into fields of lower rates of shear, so the statement should 
be modified by stating that the mechanics are similar. If the mechanics 
are similar, we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also 
be similar.   The concept of the strain energy as a Gibbs function 
difference **f and exerting a force normal to the shearing face is 
compatible with the information obtained from optical birefringence studies 
of fluids undergoing shear. Essentially these birefringence studies 
show that at low rates of shear a tension is present at 45` to 
the direction of shear, and as the rate of shear increases, the direction 
of the maximum tension moves asymptotically toward the direction 
of shear. According to Philippoff, the recoverable shear ~<s> is 
given by **f where ~|c is the angle of extinction. From this and 
the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic 
energy of deformation which should be equal to the **f calculated from 
the pressure normal to the shearing face.   There is another 
means which should show the direction and relative value of the stresses 
in viscoelastic fluids that is not mentioned as such in the literature, 
and that is the shape of the suspended drops of low viscosity fluids 
in shear fields. These droplets are distorted by the normal forces 
just as a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape in one's 
hands. These droplets appear to be ellipsoids, and it is mathematically 
convenient to assume that they are. If they are not ellipsoids, 
the conclusions will be a reasonable approximation. The direction of 
the tension of minimum pressure is, of course, given by the direction 
of the major axis of the ellipsoids. Mason and Taylor both show that 
the major axis of the ellipsoids is at 45` at low rates of shear and 
that it approaches the direction of shear with increased rates of shear. 
(Some suspensions break up before they are near to the direction 
of shear, and some become asymptotic to it without breakup.) This is, 
of course, a similar type of behavior to that indicated by birefringence 
studies. The relative forces can be calculated from the various 
radii of curvature if we assume: (<A>) The surface tension is uniform 
on the surface of the drop. (<B>) That because of the low viscosity 
of the fluid, the internal pressure is the same in all directions. 
(<C>) The kinetic effects are negligible. (<D>) Since the 
shape of the drop conforms to the force field, it does not appreciably 
affect the distribution of forces in the fluid.   These are reasonable 
assumptions with low viscosity fluids suspended in high viscosity 
fluids which are subjected to low rates of shear. Just as the pressure 
exerted by surface tension in a spherical drop is **f and the pressure 
exerted by surface tension on a cylindrical shape is **f, the 
pressure exerted by any curved surface is **f, where ~|g is the interfacial 
tension and **f and **f are the two radii of curvature. This 
formula is given by Rumscheidt and Mason. If ~<a> is the major 
axis of an ellipsoid and ~<b> and ~<c> are the other two axes, 
the radius of curvature in the ~<ab> plane at the end of the axis 
is **f, and the difference in pressure along the ~<a> and ~<b> 
axes is **f.   There are no data published in the literature on 
the shape of low viscosity drops to confirm the above formulas. However, 
there are photographs of suspended drops of cyclohexanol phthalate 
(viscosity 155 poises) suspended in corn syrup of 71 poises in a paper 
by Mason and Bartok. This viscosity of the material in the drops 
is, of course, not negligible. Measurements on the photograph in this 
paper give **f at the maximum rate of shear of **f. If it is assumed 
that the formula given by Lodge of **f, cosec 2~|c applies, the 
pressure difference along the major axes can be calculated from the angle 
of inclination of the major axis, and from this the interfacial tension 
can be calculated. Its value was **f from the above data. This 
appears to be high, as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity 
of the material in the drops.   It is appropriate to call attention 
to certain thermodynamic properties of an ideal gas that are analogous 
to rubber-like deformation. The internal energy of an ideal 
gas depends on temperature only and is independent of pressure or volume. 
In other words, if an ideal gas is compressed and kept at constant 
temperature, the work done in compressing it is completely converted 
into heat and transferred to the surrounding heat sink. This means that 
work equals ~<q> which in turn equals **f.   There is a 
well-known relationship between probability and entropy which states that 
**f, where ~\q is the probability that state (i&e&, volume 
for an ideal gas) could be reached by chance alone. this is known as 
conformational entropy. This conformational entropy is, in this case, 
equal to the usual entropy, for there are no other changes or other 
energies involved. Note that though the ideal gas itself contains no 
additional energy, the compressed gas does exert an increased pressure. 
The energy for any isothermal work done by the perfect gas must come 
as thermal energy from its surroundings.

A proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline **f as a 
function of magnetic field and temperature is presented. **f is paramagnetic, 
and electron paramagnetic dipole as well as nuclear dipole effects 
lead to line broadening. The lines are asymmetric and over the 
range of field **f gauss and temperature **f the asymmetry increases with 
increasing **f and decreasing <T>. An isotropic resonance shift 
of **f to lower applied fields indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine 
contact interaction. The general theory of resonance shifts is used to 
derive a general expression for the second moment **f of a polycrystalline 
paramagnetic sample and is specialized to **f. The theory predicts 
a linear dependence of **f on **f, where |j is the experimentally 
determined Curie-Weiss constant. The experimental second moment 
**f conforms to the relation **f in agreement with theory. Hence, the 
electron paramagnetic effects (slope) can be separated from the nuclear 
effects (intercept). The paramagnetic dipole effects provide some 
information on the particle shapes. The nuclear dipole effects provide 
some information on the motions of the hydrogen nuclei, but the symmetry 
of the **f bond in **f remains in doubt. 

#INTRODUCTION#

THE 
magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associated nearby may have a 
tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance properties of nuclei. It 
is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since 
quantitative nuclear resonance is becoming increasingly used in investigations 
of structure. **f appeared to be well suited for the study 
of these matters, since it is a normal paramagnet, with three unpaired 
electrons on the chromium, its crystal structure is very simple, 
and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong **f bond provides 
structural interest.   We first discuss the **f bond in **f. 
We 
then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipoles 
with nuclei and show that the theory is in excellent agreement with experiment. 
Indeed it is possible to separate electron paramagnetic from 
nuclear effects. The information provided by the electron paramagnetic 
effects is then discussed, and finally the nuclear effects are interpreted 
in terms of various motional-modified models of the **f bond 
in **f. #**F BOND IN **F#

Theoretical studies of the hydrogen bond 
generally agree that the **f bond will be linear in the absence of 
peculiarities of packing in the solid. Moreover, it will be asymmetric 
until a certain critical **f distance is reached, below which it will 
become symmetric. There is ample evidence from many sources that the 
**f bond in **f is symmetric. The **f distance in **f is 2.26 ~A. 
There is evidence, though less convincing than for **f, that the **f 
bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime is symmetric. Here the **f distance 
is 2.44 ~A. A number of semiempirical estimates by various workers 
lead to the conclusion that the **f bond becomes symmetric when the 
**f bond length is about 2.4 to 2.5 ~A, but aside from the possible 
example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have been no convincing reports 
of symmetric **f bonds. Douglass has studied the crystal structure 
of **f by x-ray diffraction. He finds the structure contains an **f 
bond with the **f distance of **f. There is, then, the possibility that 
this **f bond is symmetric, although Douglass was unable to determine 
its symmetry from his x-ray data.   Douglass found **f to be 
trigonal, Laue symmetry **f, with **f, **f. X-ray and experimental 
density showed one formula unit in the unit cell, corresponding to a paramagnetic 
ion density of **f. The x-ray data did not permit Douglass 
to determine uniquely the space group, but a negative test for piezoelectricity 
led him to assume a center of symmetry. Under this assumption 
the space group must be **f and the following are the positions 
of the atoms in the unit cell. **f. This space group requires the hydrogen 
bond to be symmetric. Douglass found powder intensity calculations 
and measurements to agree best for **f. These data lead to a structure 
in which sheets of ~Cr atoms lie between two sheets of ~O 
atoms. The ~O atoms in each sheet are close packed and each ~Cr 
atom is surrounded by a distorted octahedron of ~O atoms. The **f 
layers are stacked normal to the [111] axis with the lower oxygens 
of one layer directly above the upper oxygens of the neighboring lower 
layer, in such a manner that the repeat is every three layers. The 
separate layers are joined together by hydrogen bonds. A drawing of the 
structure is to be found in reference 6.   The gross details 
of the structure appear reasonable. The structure appears to be unique 
among ~<R>OOH compounds, but is the same as that assumed by 
**f. The bond angles and distances are all within the expected limits 
and the volume per oxygen is about normal. However, the possible absence 
of a center of symmetry not only moves the hydrogen atom off **f, 
but also allows the oxygen atoms to become nonequivalent, with **f at 
**f and **f at **f (space group **f), where **f represents the oxygens 
on one side of the **f layers and **f those on the other side. However, 
any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely 
short **f interlayer distance of 2.55 ~A or the non-hydrogen-bonded 
**f interlayer interactions which are already quite short at 2.58 
~A. Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing of the atoms in 
this material in which the oxygen atoms are far from geometrical equivalence. 
The only effect of lack of a center would then be to release
