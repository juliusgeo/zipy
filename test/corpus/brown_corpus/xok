#APPARATUS AND MATERIALS#

_WASH WHEEL- 
CYLINDRICAL WASH WHEEL OF THE REVERSING TYPE._ The wheel (cage) 
is 20 to 24 inches inside diameter and 20 to 24 inches inside length. 
There 
are three fins each approximately three inches wide extending the full 
length of the inside of the wheel. One fin is located every 120` 
around the inside diameter of the wheel. The wash wheel rotates at a 
speed of 30 revolutions per minute, making five to ten revolutions before 
reversing. The water inlets are large enough to permit filling the 
wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minutes, and the outlet 
is large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in 
less than two minutes. The machine is equipped with a pipe for injecting 
live steam that is capable of raising the temperature of water at 
an eight-inch level from 110` to 140`F& (38` to 60`C&) in 
less than two minutes. The machine shall contain an opening for the 
insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determining 
the temperature of the water during the washing and rinsing procedures. 
It is equipped with an outside water gauge that will indicate the 
level of the water in the wheel.   A domestic automatic washer 
that will give equivalent results may be used. The wash wheel is the 
equipment preferred for the test. _PRESSING EQUIPMENT- FLAT-BED 
PRESS MEASURING 24 INCHES BY 50 INCHES OR LARGER._ Any flat-bed press 
capable of pressing a specimen 22 inches square may be used as an 
alternative. The flat-bed press is maintained at a temperature not less 
than 275`F& (135`C&). _DRYER- DRYER OF THE ROTARY TUMBLE 
TYPE, HAVING A CYLINDRICAL BASKET APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES IN DIAMETER 
AND 24 INCHES IN LENGTH AND ROTATING AT APPROXIMATELY 35 R&P&M&._ 
The dryer is provided with a means of maintaining a drying temperature 
of 120`-160`F& (49`-71`C&), measured in the exhaust 
vent as close as possible to the drying chamber. _SCREEN DRYING 
RACKS- 16-MESH SCREENING (SARAN OR VELON)._ _DRYING ROOM-FACILITIES 
FOR DRIP- OR LINE-DRYING._ _EXTRACTOR- CENTRIFUGAL EXTRACTOR 
OF THE LAUNDRY-TYPE WITH A PERFORATED BASKET, APPROXIMATELY 11 
INCHES DEEP BY 17 INCHES IN DIAMETER, WITH AN OPERATING SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 
1,500 R&P&M&._ _PEN AND INK, INDELIBLE- OR OTHER 
SUITABLE MARKING DEVICE._ _MEASURING SCALE-._ _SOAP, NEUTRAL 
CHIP- FED& SPEC& ~P ~S 566 OR ~ASTM ~D-496._ 
_SOFTENER- E&G& SODIUM METAPHOSPHATE OR SODIUM HEXAMETAPHOSPHATE 
(IF NEEDED IN HARD WATER AREAS)._ _DETERGENT, SYNTHETIC- 
ALKYLARYSULFONATE TYPE._ _FLATIRON, ELECTRIC- APPROXIMATELY 
3 LB&_ _TENSION PRESSER- CONSISTING OF A PADDED IRONING BOARD 
FROM WHICH EXTEND CLAMPING MEMBERS ON ALL FOUR SIDES._ Two of the 
clamps are fixed to the edges of the board whereas two clamps travel on 
guide rails opposite the fixed clamps. The movable clamps travel on 
carriages which ride the rails and are drawn by dead-weight loading. 
Sets of weights are provided so that the load can be selected in the 
range of 1/2 to 4 pounds. A perforated aluminum plate, used to provide 
the drying surface, is heated by means of a flatiron. A special template 
is furnished with the apparatus to enable marking a specimen for 
a central measuring area and the fabric extensions to the clamps (see 
Fig& 2). _KNIT SHRINKAGE GAUGE- CONSISTING OF A SET OF 20 MOUNTING 
PINS SET IN GUIDES IN RADIAL SLOTS (FIG&1)._ Each pin is individually 
sprung to a tensioning member which is driven outwardly in 
the slot. The springs have an extension of 1 inch at **f tension. The 
tensioning members have a common drive so that the application of restorative 
force takes place simultaneously in all directions in the plane 
of the test specimen. The minimum diameter of the pin frame in the 
collapsed state is 11 inches and the maximum diameter in the freely 
extended state (unloaded) is 14 inches. The surface of the apparatus 
in contact with the test specimen is uncluttered and polished so as 
to be as friction-free as possible. 

#TEST SPECIMENS#

The preparation 
of test specimens will vary depending upon the type of dimensional 
restorability procedure (if any) to be used.   Three specimens 
for each sample to be tested are required in order to arrive at a satisfactory 
average of performance. This is especially true for knitted 
fabrics.   Specimens are allowed to reach moisture equilibrium with 
a standard atmosphere of **f and **f and then laid out without tension 
on a flat, polished surface, care being taken that the fabric is 
free from wrinkles or creases. Fabrics that are badly distorted in their 
unlaundered state due to faulty finishing may give deceptive dimensional 
change results when laundered by any procedure. This also holds 
true 
if restorative forces are applied. Therefore, it is recommended that 
in such cases the sample be replaced, or if used, the results of dimensional 
change or dimensional restorability tests be considered as indicative 
only.   Generally, it is necessary to mark distances on 
a specimen (or garment) in both lengthwise and widthwise directions and 
to measure before and after laundering. The distances may be marked 
with indelible ink and a fine-point pen, by sewing fine threads into 
the fabric, or by a specially designed stamping machine. The marked distances 
are parallel to the respective yarns. Usually, the greater the 
original distances marked, the greater will be the accuracy of the 
test. Distances of less than 10 inches are not recommended. _WOVEN 
FABRICS TO BE DRIED BY PROCEDURE ~B (FLAT-BED PRESSED) OR RESTORED BY 
PROCEDURE 3 (HAND IRONING):_ The specimen of fabric is a rectangle 
at least 22 by 22 inches, except for cloth narrower than 22 inches, 
in which case the specimen is the entire width of the fabric. Three 
distances, each at least 18 inches, are measured and marked off parallel 
to each of the warp and filling directions. The distances are at 
least two inches from any edge of the specimen. _WOVEN OR WARP KNITTED 
FABRICS TO BE SUBJECTED TO RESTORATIVE PROCEDURE 1 (TENSION PRESSER)._ 
Each specimen is at least 25 inches by 25 inches. Place the template 
(Fig& 2) on the fabric so that the sides of the 10 inch square 
cut out of the template are parallel to the warp and filling for woven 
fabrics, or the wales and courses for knitted fabrics, and so that the 
same amount of fabric extends beyond the edges of the template on all 
sides. Mark the specimen at the outer edges of the template with pen 
and <indelible ink;> also place three dots on the specimen at each 
side of the 10 inch square, one dot at midpoint, and one at approximately 
1/2 inch from each corner. Measure and record. _CIRCULAR KNITTED 
FABRICS TO BE SUBJECTED TO RESTORATIVE PROCEDURE 2, (KNIT SHRINKAGE 
GAUGE)._ Each specimen is approximately 16 inches square. The markings 
consist of a centrally located 10 inch diameter measuring circle 
and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dots equidistantly spaced (See 
Figure 1). _GARMENTS._ Critical measurements in length and width 
directions should be taken before and after washing, drying, and restorative 
procedures. 

#PROCEDURE#

_WASHING-_ The washing 
procedures are summarized in Table /2,.   Place the specimen 
in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry 
load of **f pounds. Start the wash wheel and note the time. Immediately 
add water at 100-105`F& (38-43`C&) to the wheel to a level 
of **f inches; this level will be increased by condensed steam. 
When this water level has been reached, inject steam into the wheel until 
the temperature reaches that shown in Column ~B of Table /2,. 
Add sufficient soap (and softener if required to counteract hard 
water) to furnish a good running suds, or if desired use a synthetic detergent. 
_TEST /1,_- Stop the wash wheel at the end of the 
time 
shown in Column ~A of Table /2, and drain. Refill the machine 
to a level of **f inches with water at 100-109` F& (38-43` C&) 
and start the machine. Inject steam, if necessary, to reach the 
temperature shown in Column ~D of Table /2,. Again stop the machine 
at the end of the time shown in Column ~C of Table /2,. 
This procedure is repeated for the second rinse, using the temperatures 
and time shown in Columns ~F and ~E of Table /2,. _TESTS 
/2,, /3,, 
AND /4,._- Run the machine continuously until completion 
of the test. Drain off the soap solution of the suds cycle at such 
a time that the wheel has become substantially empty of soap and water 
at the end of the time shown in Column ~A of Table /2,, measured 
from the time the wash wheel was started. Refill the machine to a 
level of **f inches with water at 100-109` F& (38-43` C&). 
When this water level has been reached, inject steam until the temperature 
is that shown in Column ~D. Drain off the water at such a time 
that the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end 
of the sum of the times shown in Columns ~A and ~C, measured from 
the time the wash wheel was started. Immediately refill to a level 
of **f inches with water at 100-109` F& (38-43` C&). When 
this water level has been reached inject steam until the temperature is 
that shown in Column ~F. Drain off the water at such a time that 
the wheel has become substantially empty of water at the end of the 
sum of the times shown in Columns ~A, ~C, and ~E, measured from 
the time the wash wheel was started.

High-gain, photoelectronic image intensification is applied under 
conditions of low incident light levels whenever the integration time 
required by a sensor or recording instrument exceeds the limits of 
practicability. Examples of such situations are (aerial) night reconnaissance, 
the recording of radioactive tracers in live body tissues, 
special radiography in medical or industrial applications, track recording 
of high energy particles, etc&.   High-gain photoelectronic 
image intensification may be achieved by several methods; some of 
these are listed below: _(A)_ Cascading single stages by coupling 
lens systems, _(B)_ Channel-type, secondary emission image intensifier, 
_(C)_ Image intensifier based upon the "multipactor" 
principle, _(D)_ Transmission secondary electron multiplication 
image intensifiers (~TSEM tubes), _(E)_ Cascading of single 
stages, enclosed in one common envelope.   Cascading single stages 
by <coupling lens systems> is rather inefficient as the lens systems 
limit the obtainable gain quite severely. Channel-type image intensifiers 
are capable of achieving high-gain values; suffer, however, 
from an inherently low resolution. Image intensifiers based upon 
the multipactor principle appear to hold promise as far as obtainable 
resolution is concerned. However, the unavoidable low-duty cycle restricts 
the effective gain. ~TSEM tubes have been constructed showing 
high gain and resolution. However, electrostatic focus, important 
for many applications, has not been realized for these devices. Resolution 
limitations with electrostatic focus might be anticipated due to 
chromatic aberrations. Furthermore, the thin film dynodes appear to 
have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support cannot be 
tolerated.   <Cascaded> single stages enclosed by a <common envelope> 
have been constructed with high gain and high resolution. These 
tubes may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system 
and in the design of the coupling members. The electron optical system 
may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one. The magnification 
may be smaller, equal, or larger than unity.   An electrostatic 
system suffers generally from image plane curvature leading to defocusing 
in the peripheral image region if a flat viewing screen (or interstage 
coupler) is utilized, while a magnetic system requires accurate 
adjustment of the solenoid, which is heavy and bulky. As it will be discussed 
later, peripheral defocusing can be improved on by utilizing 
curved fiber couplers. It should be noted, however, that the paraxial 
resolution is quite similar for both electron optical systems. 
It is felt that fiber-coupled double- (and multi-) stage image intensifiers 
will gain considerable importance in the future. Therefore, we 
shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capabilities 
of such tubes. The luminous efficiency and resolution of single 
stages, fiber couplers, and finally of the composite tube will be 
computed.   It will be shown theoretically that the high image 
intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permits
