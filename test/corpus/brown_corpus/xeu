of coarse salt that kept them hot when served- was a standby at Manning's. 
Its early morning patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves 
for the day with that delicacy.   In the 1890's the 
Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager, John 
C& Kirkpatrick. This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller 
made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace 
chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters. (Gastronomes 
have long argued about which came first, the Palace's or Antoine's. 
Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod 
on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding. The 
Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional.) Vernon, however, 
held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it, unadorned by herbs 
or any seasoning but salt, though he did fancy a bit of lemon. 
After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect the rig; this 
was merely a ritual, to please all hands concerned. The tallyho had 
cost Vernon $2,300. A replica of two coaches made in England for the 
Belmont Club in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it 
was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run. One could shave in 
the reflection of its French-polished panels, and its axles were greased 
like those of roulette wheels. The horses were groomed to a high 
gloss; departing, they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw, 
for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.   But 
for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip fell. The clients boarded 
the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven. They had been fed 
a hunting breakfast, so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified 
with fox hunting, was on the bill. There are many ways of making a 
kedgeree, every one of which is right. Here is an original kedgeree 
recipe from the Family Club's kitchen: 

#CLUB KEDGEREE#

Flake 
(for three) a cupful of cold boiled haddock, mix with a cupful of cooked 
rice, two minced hard-boiled eggs, some buttery white sauce done 
with cream, cayenne, pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of 
minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy. Heat and serve hot on toast.

The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's chef, 
was even more in demand. For decades it was the most popular dish 
served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast, and it is one of the few 
old Palace dishes that still survive. Native California oysters, 
salty and piquant, as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a 
five-cent piece, went into it. The original formula goes thus: 

#OMELET 
ARBOGAST#

Fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with a tablespoonful 
of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs, pepper, 
celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives, a dash of cayenne, and a 
pinch of nutmeg. A jigger of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture 
stiffens, in go a hundred of the little oysters.   Louis Sherry 
once stayed a fortnight at the Palace, and he was so pleased with omelet 
Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York. 
J& Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco, 
to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the restaurateur 
with him. As things happened, Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill 
residence of a magnate friend, whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved 
talent. Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused himself 
as best he could. Twice he left everything to his entourage, and 
fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance.

In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its tiers of Moorish 
galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's 
station was at the entrance. It was a post of honor, held inviolate 
for him; he had the primacy among the coachmen. Of majestic build, 
rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled the late General Winfield 
Scott, who was said to be the most imposing general of his century, 
if not of all centuries. Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia, 
and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly.

Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in 
the tallyho. He had style: he held his reins in a loose bunch at the 
third button of his checked Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned 
at a curve, as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them. 
They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until the coach reached 
Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin.   The road 
maps of the region have changed since 1905; inns have burned down, moved 
elsewhere, or taken other names. Once on the road (and especially 
if the passengers were all regulars and masculine), the schedule meant 
nothing. An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of 
the tallyho, from which there issued clouds of smoke. Vernon would tilt 
his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard, 
indulging in a huge cigar. The horses moved at a clump; they were no 
more on parade than was their driver; one fork of the road was as 
good as another. The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties, 
and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed 
columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes the Santa Clara 
valley below at the left. The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts 
of fernery. You arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted 
not to bring a mackintosh.   Vernon kept an account book 
with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage. 
A number of them must have fallen into disfavor; they were 
struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing both the cooks and the 
management. He was copious in his praise of those that served food that 
was good to eat. The horses seemed to know these by instinct, he used 
to say: such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins.

There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees, its wide 
verandas strewn with rockers. Many of its sojourners were devoted 
to seclusion and quiet, and lived there to the end of their days. It 
was 
the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods. Acorns 
from the great oaks fed the small black pigs (akin to Berkshires), 
whose "carcass sweepstakes" were renowned. Their ham butts, cured 
in oak-log smoke, were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served 
with this original sauce: 

#WRIGHT'S DEVIL SAUCE#

Put into 
a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy, or of the boiled ham liquor, 
with a half stick of butter, three teaspoonfuls of made mustard, 
and two mashed garlic cloves. Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato 
and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime. After this has simmered 
an hour, add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire, catsup, and 
chutney, two pickled walnuts, and a pint of Sherry. Then simmer fifteen 
minutes longer. ##

Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made 
and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar, so 
that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.   Vineyards 
and orchards also grew around Wright's, and deer were rather a nuisance; 
they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers. But 
no one complained when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison 
pies. No one complained of the white wine either: at this altitude 
of two thousand feet, grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint. 
(The Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height.) Apple 
trees grew there also. Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains 
flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring, the apples that 
grow there have a wintry crackle.   Dwellers thereabouts preferred 
to get their apple pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven 
fired with redwood billets. The merit of the pie, Vernon believed, 
was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven. The recipe, 
which he got from the baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically 
this: 

#WRIGHT'S APPLE PIE#

Peel, core, and slice across 
enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin, and set aside. In a 
saucepan put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount of sugar, 
a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam, a pinch each 
of clove and nutmeg, and a large bay leaf. Let this boil gently for 
twenty minutes, then strain. Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve 
minutes, drain them, and cool.   Set the apples in the pastry-lined 
tin, spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter, 
with as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a fresh bay leaf, 
then lay on a cover of pastry, and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.

THOSE WHO have never traveled the width and length of this 
land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook description alone, the 
overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one 
government. The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most 
strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the 
Midwest; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains; the 
smoke-filled, art-filled, drama-filled life of the great cities of the 
East; the lush and historic charm of the South. Now, to add to the 
already unbelievable extremes found in one nation, we have the two 
new states of Hawaii and Alaska.   To hope to cover just one 
region of this land and to enjoy all of its sights and events and, of 
course, to bring back pictures of your experiences, requires advance planning. 
For this reason, <U&S& Camera> has prepared this special 
U&S&A& vacation feature. We divided the country into five 
regions plus Hawaii and Alaska and in each is included a general 
description of the area plus specific recommendations of places and events 
to cover. Any special photographic requirements are also given.

Use this section to plan now to make the most of your vacation 
in photogenic America. 

#THE NORTHEAST#

BIRTHPLACE of the 
nation, the Northeast offers historic battlefields; lovely old villages 
and a rugged seashore among its many worthwhile sights. The rolling 
farms of Maryland, the peerless metropolis of New York City, 
the verdant mountains of Vermont can all be included in your Northeast 
vacation.   By automobile from New York, for example, you can 
take a one or two-day tour to Annapolis, Maryland to see the colonial 
homes and the U&S& Naval Academy (where you can shoot the 
dress parade on Wednesdays); to Washington, D&C&, for an eye-filling 
tour of the city; or to Lancaster, Pa&, the center of 
the Pennsylvania Dutch country; Philadelphia with its historic buildings 
and nearby Valley Forge; to West Point, N&Y&, the 
famous military academy in a beautiful setting on the Hudson River.

New England deserves as much of your vacation time as you can 
afford with such areas as Cape Cod providing wonderful beaches, artists' 
colonies and quaint townships. From here you can easily include 
a side trip to the old whaling port of Nantucket, Massachusetts, 
which looks just as it must have two centuries ago.   At Sturbridge 
Village, Massachusetts, you'll find a completely-restored New 
England town. North to Acadia National Park, Maine, with views 
of a rockbound coast and dark, magnificent forests.   One of the 
most exciting ways to end a Northeast vacation would be with a week 
in New York City. Return through New England, stopping for a visit 
to Lake Champlain where you can take a boat ride and go to Ethan 
Allen Park. There you'll witness a view which includes the Adirondack
