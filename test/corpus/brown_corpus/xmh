to have a generator of **f which is not a secant but a tangent of ~\g, 
for then any point on such a generator will be transformed into 
the point of tangency. Since two curves of symbol **f on ~<Q> intersect 
in **f points, it follows that there are **f lines of **f which 
are tangent to ~\g. Clearly, any line, ~<l>, of any bundle 
having one of these points of tangency, ~<T>, as vertex will be transformed 
into the entire pencil having the image of the second intersection 
of ~<l> and ~<Q> as vertex and lying in the plane determined 
by the image point and the generator of **f which is tangent to 
~\g at ~<T>. A line through two of these points, **f and **f, 
will be transformed into the entire bilinear congruence having the 
tangents to ~\g at **f and **f as directrices.   A conic, ~<C>, 
being a (1, 1) curve on ~<Q>, meets the image of any line 
of **f, which we have already found to be a **f curve on ~<Q>, 
in **f points. Hence its image, ~<C'>, meets any line of **f 
in **f points. Moreover, ~<C'> obviously meets any line **f in 
a single point. Hence ~<C'> is a **f curve on ~<Q>. Therefore, 
the congruence of its secants, that is the image of a general 
plane field of lines, is of order **f and class **f. Finally, the image 
of a general bundle of lines is a congruence whose order is the order 
of the congruence of invariant lines, namely **f and whose class is 
the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of lines, 
namely **f.

The preceding observations make it clear that there 
exist line involutions of all orders greater than 1 with no complex 
of invariant lines and with a complex of singular lines consisting exclusively 
of the lines which meet a twisted curve ~\g. We now shall 
show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily 
of the type we have just described.   To do this we must first 
show that every line which meets ~\g in a point ~<P> meets its 
image at ~<P>. To see this, consider a general pencil of lines 
containing a general secant of ~\G. By (1), the image of this pencil 
is a ruled surface of order **f which is met by the plane of the 
pencil in a curve, ~<C>, of order **f. On ~<C> there is a 
**f correspondence in which the **f points cut from ~<C> by a general 
line, ~<l>, of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection 
of the image of ~<l> and the plane of the pencil. Since ~<C> 
is rational, this correspondence has ~<k> coincidences, each 
of which implies a line of the pencil which meets its image. However, 
since the pencil contains a secant of ~\g it actually contains only 
**f singular lines. To avoid this contradiction it is necessary that 
~<C> be composite, with the secant of ~\g and a curve of 
order **f as components. Thus it follows that the secants of ~\g 
are all invariant. But if this is the case, then an arbitrary pencil 
of lines having a point, ~<P>, of ~\g as vertex is transformed 
into a ruled surface of order **f having **f generators concurrent at 
~<P>. Since a ruled surface of order ~<n> with ~<n> concurrent 
generators 
is necessarily a cone, it follows finally that every line through 
a point, ~<P>, of ~\g meets its image at ~<P>, as asserted.

Now consider the transformation of the lines of a bundle 
with vertex, ~<P>, on ~\g which is effected by the involution 
as a whole. From the preceding remarks, it is clear that such a bundle 
is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion. Moreover, 
in this involution there is a cone of invariant lines of order **f, namely 
the cone of secants of ~\g which pass through ~<P>. Hence 
it follows that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective 
de Jonquieres involution of order **f and the invariant locus must 
have a multiple line of multiplicity either **f or **f. The first possibility 
requires that there be a line through ~<P> which meets 
~\g in **f points; the second requires that there be a line through 
~<P> which meets ~\g in **f points. In each case, lines 
of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they 
determine with the multiple secant. In the first case the fixed elements 
within each pencil are the multiple secant and the line joining the 
vertex, ~<P>, to the intersection of ~\g and the plane of 
the pencil which does not lie on the multiple secant. In the second, 
the fixed elements are the lines which join the vertex, ~<P>, to 
the two intersections of ~\g and the plane of the pencil which do 
not lie on the multiple secant. The multiple secants, of course, are 
exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order **f.

Observations similar to these can be made at each point of ~\g. 
Hence ~\g must have either a regulus of **f-fold secants or 
a regulus of **f-fold secants. Moreover, if **f, no two of the multiple 
secants can intersect. For if such were the case, either the plane 
of the two lines would meet ~\g in more than ~<k> points or, 
alternatively, the order of the image regulus of the pencil determined 
by the two lines would be too high. But if no two lines of the regulus 
of multiple secants of ~\g can intersect, then the regulus must 
be quadratic, or in other words, ~\g must be either a **f or a **f 
curve on a nonsingular quadric surface.   We now observe that 
the case in which ~\g is a **f curve on a quadric is impossible if 
the complex of singular lines consists exclusively of the lines which 
meet ~\g. For any pencil in a plane containing a **f-fold secant 
of ~\g has an image regulus which meets the plane of the pencil 
in **f lines, namely the images of the lines of the pencil which pass 
through the intersection of ~\g and the multiple secant, plus an additional 
component to account for the intersections of the images of 
the general lines of the pencil. However, if there is no additional complex 
of singular lines, the order of the image regulus of a pencil is 
precisely **f. This contradicts the preceding observations, and so, 
under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that 
~\g is a **f curve on a quadric surface.   Continuing with 
the case in which ~\g is a **f curve on a quadric ~<Q>, we first 
observe that the second regulus of ~<Q> consists precisely of 
the lines which join the two free intersections of ~\g and the planes 
through any one of the multiple secants. For each of these lines 
meets ~<Q> in three points, namely two points on ~\g and one 
point on one of the multiple secants.   Now consider an arbitrary 
line, ~<l>, meeting ~<Q> in two points, **f and **f. If 
~|a is the multiple secant of ~\g which passes through **f and 
~|b is the simple secant of ~\g which passes through **f, and 
if **f are the points in which ~|a meets ~\g, and if **f is the 
image of **f on the generator ~|b, it follows that the image of 
the line **f is **f.

These societies can expect to face difficult times. As the historic 
processes of modernization gradually gain momentum, their cohesion 
will be threatened by divisive forces, the gaps between rulers and 
subjects, town and country, will widen; new aspirants for power will 
emerge whose ambitions far exceed their competence; old rulers may 
lose their nerve and their sense of direction. National leaders will 
have to display the highest skills of statesmanship to guide their people 
through times of uncertainty and confusion which destroy men's 
sense of identity. Feelings of a community of interest will have to 
be recreated- in some of the new nations, indeed, they must be built 
for the first time- on a new basis which looks toward the future and 
does not rely only on shared memories of the past. Nevertheless, with 
foresight and careful planning, some of the more disruptive and dangerous 
consequences of social change which have troubled other countries 
passing through this stage can be escaped. The United States can 
help by communicating a genuine concern with the problems these countries 
face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate forms 
of assistance where possible.   Our central goal should be 
to provide the greatest positive incentive for these societies to tackle 
boldly the tasks which they face. At the same time, we should recognize 
that the obstacles to change and the lack of cohesion and stability 
which characterize these countries may make them particularly prone 
to diversions and external adventures of all sorts. It may seem to some 
of them that success can be purchased much less dearly by fishing 
in the 
murky waters of international politics than by facing up to the intractable 
tasks at home. We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion, 
both by offering assistance for their domestic needs and by reacting 
firmly to irresponsible actions on the world scene. When necessary, 
we should make it clear that countries which choose to derive marginal 
advantages from the cold war or to exploit their potential for 
disrupting the security of the world will not only lose our sympathy but 
also risk their own prospects for orderly development. As a nation, 
we feel an obligation to assist other countries in their development; 
but this obligation pertains only to countries which are honestly 
seeking to become responsible members of a stable and forward-moving world 
community. 

#TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES#

When we look at countries like 
Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Burma, where substantial progress has been 
made 
in creating a minimum supply of modern men and of social overhead capital, 
and where institutions of centralized government exist, we find 
a second category of countries with a different set of problems and hence 
different priorities for policy. The men in power are committed 
in principle to modernization, but economic and social changes are proceeding 
only erratically. Isolated enterprises have been launched, but 
they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern. The 
society is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban 
sector and a relatively untouched rural sector, with very poor communications 
between the two. Progress is impeded by psychological inhibitions 
to effective action among those in power and by a failure on 
their part to understand how local resources, human and material, can 
be mobilized to achieve the national goals of modernization already symbolically 
accepted.   Most countries in this second category share 
the difficulty of having many of the structures of a modern political 
and social system without the modern standards of performance required 
to make them effective. In these rapidly changing societies there 
is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals. 
The colonial period has generally left people believing that government 
can, if it wishes, provide all manner of services for them- 
and that with independence free men do not have to work to realize the 
benefits of modern life. For example, in accordance with the fashion 
of the times, most transitional societies have announced economic development 
plans of varying numbers of years; such is the mystique of 
planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow 
automatically upon its announcement. The civil services in such societies 
are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems facing 
them; and their members often equate a government career with security 
and status rather than with sacrifice, self-discipline, and competence.

American policy should press constantly the view that 
until these governments demand efficiency and effectiveness of their 
bureaucracies there is not the slightest hope that they will either modernize 
of democratize their societies. We should spread the view that 
planning and national development are serious matters which call for 
effort as well as enthusiasm. Above all, we should seek to encourage 
the leaders of these societies to accept the unpleasant fact that they 
are responsible for their fates. Only within the framework of a mature 
relationship characterized by honest appraisals of performance can 
we provide telling assistance. With respect to those countries whose 
leaders prefer to live with their illusions, we can afford to wait, 
for in time their comparative lack of progress will become clear for all 
to see.   Our technical assistance to these countries should 
place special emphasis on inducing the central governments to assume the 
role of advisor and guide which at an earlier stage foreign experts 
assumed in dealing with the central governments. We should encourage
