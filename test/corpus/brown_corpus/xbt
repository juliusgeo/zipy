making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause. On display were 
343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection- 
and every single one of them was up for sale.   Like Philadelphia's 
late Dr& Albert C& Barnes who kept his own great collection 
closed to the general public (TIME, Jan& 2), Thompson, 
at 61, is something of a legend in his own lifetime. He made his 
fortune during World War /2, when he took over a number of dying 
steel plants and kept them alive until the boom. Even before he hit 
big money, he had begun buying modern paintings. He gave the impression 
of never having read a word about art, but there was no doubt that 
he had an eye for the best.   He was able to smell a bargain- 
and a masterpiece- a continent away, and the Museum of Modern Art's 
Alfred Barr said of him: "I have never mentioned a new artist 
that Thompson didn't know about". He might barge into a gallery, 
start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting. 
He could be lavishly generous with friends, cab drivers and bellboys, 
but with dealers he was tough. He bought up Cezannes, Braques, Matisses, 
Legers, a splendid Picasso series, more than 70 Giacometti 
sculptures. He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees 
in the world. All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's 
Throw, outside Pittsburgh, and only people he liked and trusted 
ever got to see them.   Two years ago Thompson offered his 
collection to the city. But he insisted that it be housed in a special 
museum. Pittsburgh turned him down, just as Pittsburgh society had 
been snubbing him for years. He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art 
dealer named Ernst Beyeler, with whom he had long been trading pictures. 
Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees 
to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which will house them in 
a museum that is yet to be built. Last week most of the other prizes, 
once offered to Pittsburgh, went on the block.   At the opening 
of the Du^sseldorf show, Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the 
treasures that he was seeing together for the last time. In fact he 
seemed delighted to get rid of them. Some observers speculated that 
this might be his revenge on his home town. Thompson himself said: 
"I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new 
pictures". 

#BREAK IN GEORGIA#

The University of Georgia has long claimed that 
it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis 
of race or color. But in all its 175 years, not a single Negro 
student has entered its classrooms. Last week Federal District Judge 
William A& Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately 
a "qualified" Negro boy and girl. Their entry will crack the 
total segregation of all public education, from kindergarten through graduate 
school, in Georgia- and in Alabama, Mississippi and South 
Carolina as well.   For 18 months, Hamilton Holmes, 19, and 
Charlayne Hunter, 18, had tried to get into the university. They graduated 
together from Atlanta's Turner High School, where Valedictorian 
Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third. The university 
rejected them on a variety of pretexts, but was careful never 
to mention the color of their skins. Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse 
(Negro) College, where he is a B+ student and star halfback. 
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University. 
Last fall, after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to 
court, Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again.   Charlayne 
was "tentatively" admitted for next fall, after state investigators 
questioned her white roommate at Wayne State. But Holmes was rejected 
again "on the basis of his record and interview". The evidence 
in court was testimony about the interview, which for Holmes lasted 
an hour, although at least one white student at Georgia got through 
this ritual by a simple phone conversation. Holmes was asked if he 
had ever visited a house of prostitution, or a "beatnik parlor or teahouse". 
No, said he, but officials still called him "evasive". 
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been "arrested". 
Their reason: Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine, had his license 
suspended.   Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white 
students, found that many were hardly interviewed at all- and few 
had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes. The real reason 
for his rejection, they argued, is the fact that Georgia law automatically 
cuts off funds for any desegregated school.   Judge Bootle's 
decision: "The two plaintiffs are qualified for admission 
to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been 
for their race and color". The state will appeal- but few think 
it will actually try to close the university. "Surprised and pleased", 
Students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia 
this week. 

#CATCH FOR CHICAGO#

When the University of 
Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A& Kimpton 
submitted his resignation last March, a mighty talent hunt 
gripped the Midway. Out went letters to 60,000 old grads, asking for 
suggestions. Such academic statesmen as James B& Conant were consulted. 
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors, including 
Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, and Harvard's Dean McGeorge 
Bundy. The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither 
a big name nor an experienced academic administrator, but rather, 
as Trustee Chairman Glen A& Lloyd put it, "a top scholar in 
his own right"- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.

Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's 
acting dean of the faculty: dynamic Geneticist George Wells 
Beadle, 57, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology 
for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell 
chemistry (TIME, Cover, July 14, 1958).   It fell to Chancellor 
Kimpton, now a Standard Oil (Indiana) executive, to spend 
his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of 
Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins. He threw out some of Hutchins' 
more wildly experimental courses, raised sagging undergraduate enrollment 
to 2,100, nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million. But though 
Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order, some old grads 
feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it 
in the heady Hutchins era.   At Caltech, Geneticist Beadle 
has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology 
division since 1946. But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot, 
recruit and excite able researchers, and has developed unexpected 
talents in fund raising and speech-making. Beadle is even that rare 
scientist 
who takes an interest in money matters; he avidly reads the 
<Wall Street Journal>, and took delight in driving a $250 model ~A 
Ford for 22 years, then selling it for $300.

A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began 
with the old Adam and consequently will never end. But a historian 
might put his finger on a specific man and date, and hold out the hope 
that the troubles will sometime pass away. The man was King Leopold 
/2, of the Belgians, who in 1885 concluded that he had better 
grab a colony while the grabbing was still good. By force, he took under 
his protection, or stole, 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central 
Africa. This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe; 
and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political 
or historical unity. Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography 
or ethnic groupings; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's 
explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.   The population 
of the Congo is 13.5 million, divided into at least seven major 
"culture clusters" and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate 
dialects. The religions of the people include Christianity, Mohammedanism, 
paganism, ancestor worship and animism. The climate ranges from 
the steamily equatorial to the temperate. The hospitals contain patients 
trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars. To make one 
nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any 
case; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have 
done, or failed to do, in the Congo since 1885.   At first the 
Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property. 
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience. 
The Belgian government itself took over administration, commencing 
a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism. 
One definition of paternalism is "The principle or practice, 
on the part of a government, of managing the affairs of a country in 
the manner of a father dealing with his children". The honor of the 
Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned- only their judgment. 
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time- 
but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child, 
if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was 52 and had until 
then been treated as an infant. ##

The Belgians were interested 
primarily in the economic development of the Congo, which is rich in 
copper, tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton and palm 
oil. The colony was administered from Brussels, with neither the 
Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote. The beneficiaries 
of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both 
individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock. In <Inside 
Africa>, John Gunther describes one of these, the Societe Generale, 
as "the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if, let us 
say, the House of Morgan, Anaconda Copper, the Mutual Life Insurance 
Company of New York, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and various 
companies producing agricultural products were lumped together, with 
the United States <government> as a heavy partner".   Had 
they been truly ruthless, the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese 
without compassion. But they were not. They provided a social 
security system which covered all their African employes; their program 
of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent; 
they put much effort into public housing. They also instituted a ration 
system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish 
their employes with clothing and adequate food. But instead of 
delivering the ration- either in actual commodities or in cash- at 
intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month, the Belgians felt obliged 
to dole it out more often. Would not the children, if they received all 
their food on the first day of the month, eat it up immediately, and 
later go hungry?   The Belgians also placed great emphasis 
on education. During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in 
the Congo. But almost all the schools were primary. The average Congolese 
can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of "<la chatte>" 
and "<le chien>" and write his name. Some schools were 
technical- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit 
the land, and trained many. But they did not believe in widespread 
secondary education, much less in college. It was their conviction 
that the people should be "brought up together", a grade at a time, 
until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history, 
economics and political science. Indeed, the Belgians discouraged 
higher education, fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite 
which might cause unrest. When the Congo received its independence 
in 1960 there were, among its 13.5 million people, exactly 14 university 
graduates. ##

Why did the Belgians grant independence to a 
colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it? In one large oversimplification, 
it might be said that the Belgians felt, far too late, the 
gale of nationalism sweeping Africa. They lacked time to prepare 
the Congo, as the British and French had prepared their colonies. The 
Congolese were clamoring for their independence, even though most 
were unsure what it meant; and in Brussels, street crowds shouted, 
"<Pas une goutte de sang!>" (Not one drop of blood!). The 
Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue; 
rather than teach where teaching was not wanted, they would 
wash their hands of the mess. It is hard to blame them for this. Yet
