#UNITED NATIONS DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR# 

For the purpose of maintaining international peace and promoting 
the advancement of all people, the United States of America joined 
in founding the United Nations.   The United Nations Charter 
sets forth standards which, if adhered to, will promote peace and justice 
throughout the world. It is extremely important for each American 
to realize that the theme "The United Nations is your business" 
applies to him personally.   The world desperately needs the 
United Nations. United Nations Day is the birthday of the United 
Nations, mankind's noblest attempt to establish lasting peace with 
justice; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR 
OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM 
TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24TH, 1961, AS UNITED NATIONS DAY, calling upon 
all 
our citizens to engage in appropriate observances, demonstrating faith 
in the United Nations and thereby contributing to a better understanding 
of the aims of the United Nations throughout the land.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused 
the seal of the State to be affixed this 5th day of July, in the year 
of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, 
the one hundred and eighty-sixth.   governor 

#THE STATE BALLET OF RHODE ISLAND WEEK PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, 
JR&, GOVERNOR#

The ballet originated in Italy about 1450. At 
that time it was a series of sophisticated social dances whose steps 
were often combined with other steps devised by the choreographer. Ballet 
flowered in Italy during the next hundred years, and about 1550 
was carried to France when the Italian princess, Catherine de Medicis, 
married the King of France. The most famous ballet of that time 
was called Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581). Dances alternated 
with sung or spoken verses. Ballets were used in opera from its beginning. 
They were placed either in the middle of the acts or in the intermissions.

The State Ballet of Rhode Island, the first 
incorporated group, was formed for the purpose of extending knowledge 
of the art of ballet in the Community, to promote interest in ballet 
performances, to contribute to the cultural life of the State, and to 
provide opportunity for gifted dance students who, for one reason or 
another, are unable to pursue a career and to develop others for the professional 
state; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, 
PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1961, AS THE STATE BALLET OF 
RHODE ISLAND WEEK, requesting all Rhode Islanders to give special 
attention to this unusual event which should contribute to the cultural 
life of the State.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto 
set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 
23d day of October, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred 
and sixty-one, and of Independence, the one hundred and eighty-sixth.

#PROCLAMATION THANKSGIVING DAY BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& GOVERNOR# 

As another Thanksgiving draws near, let us take time out from the often 
hectic pace of our lives to try and recapture the feelings that filled 
the hearts of the Pilgrims on the first Thanksgiving.   The 
Pilgrims gathered to thank the Lord for His benevolence during 
their first year in the new land. They had been through trying times, 
but their faith in the Almighty had given them the courage and the strength 
to meet and overcome the many problems and difficulties that were 
the price they had to pay for freedom. And as the Pilgrims bowed 
their heads in humble gratitude, they shared another feeling- the anticipation 
of what the future held for them and their posterity. They 
could not guess that from their concepts of liberty and freedom would 
some day be born a new nation that for years would be the symbol of 
hope to the oppressed countries of the world. They simply turned to God 
filled with gratitude and faith.   We who are living today may 
learn a valuable lesson from those who celebrated the first Thanksgiving 
Day. The Lord has shown time and time again His love for us. 
We have only to compare the liberty and high standard of living we 
enjoy in this great country with the oppression and frugality of other 
nations to realize with humble gratitude that God's Providence has 
been with us since the very beginning of our country. And yet, accompanying 
our gratitude is the realization that we are living in a crucial 
time. With world peace constantly being threatened, most of us regard 
the future skeptically, and even with fear. It is at this time that 
we should imitate the Pilgrims by accompanying our prayers of thanks 
with the conviction that we shall continue to be in dire need for 
the Lord's protection in the future, if we are to have peace; NOW, 
THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF 
RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 
23RD, 1961, AS THANKSGIVING DAY,   And so, let us remember on 
this day not only to thank the Almighty Who gave hope and courage 
to the Pilgrims, but also to place our trust in Him that He will continue 
to protect us in the future as He has in the past.   IN 
TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal 
of the State to be affixed this 21st day of November, in the year 
of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one and of Independence, 
the one hundred and eighty-sixth. John A& Notte Jr&
