about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds 
to realize what. It was not merely that flies were crawling over his 
face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into 
his eye sockets. A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into 
the socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and across the wet 
surface of the eyeball, and the eye did not blink. The Australian 
and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered 
by insects, but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.

I turned to look at the lubra. She remained squatting on her heels 
all the time we were there; like the man, she was entirely naked. 
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family 
possessions which were placed in front of her. There were two rubbing 
sticks for making fire, two stones shaped roughly like knives, a woven-root 
container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead 
body of some rodent. There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera, 
a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity 
and high accuracy. There was also a boomerang, elaborately carved. Everything 
was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects 
seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.

The two children, both boys, wandered around the Australian 
and me for a few moments and then returned to their work. They squatted 
on their heels with their heads bent far forward, their eyes only 
a few inches from the ground. They had located the runway of a colony 
of ants and as the ants came out of the ground, the boys picked them 
up, one at a time, and pinched them dead. The tiny bodies, dropped onto 
a dry leaf, made a pile as big as a small apple.   The odor 
here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines. 
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant. It was also 
subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied 
innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed. 
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant. 
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one. The smell is sexual, but 
so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.   Their 
skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost 
the consistency of a second skin. They roll at night in ashes to keep 
warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it. In spots 
such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized 
the aborigines were much darker than they appeared; as if the coating 
of sweat, dirt, and ashes were a cosmetic. The boys had beautiful 
dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies 
and blinked their eyes.   "That smell is something, eh, mate"? 
the Australian asked. "They swear that every person smells 
different and every family smells different from every other. At the 
<corroborees,> when they get to dancing and sweating, you'll see 
them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good 
smell. Idje, here", and he nodded at the man, "is said to have 
great odor. The stink is all the same to me, but I really think they 
can make one another out blindfolded".   "Here, Idje, you 
fella like tabac"? he said sharply. Idje still stared over our shoulders 
at the horizon. The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin 
I could understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.

It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the seventeenth 
century was a great period in Persian art. The architects, the tile 
and carpet makers, the potters, painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths 
worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich 
the city. Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by 
what must have seemed an illusion: a great garden filled with nightingales 
and roses, cut by canals and terraced promenades, studded with 
water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening 
blue curves of a hundred domes. At the heart of all of this was the square, 
which one such traveler declared to be "as spacious, as pleasant 
and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe". In time Isfahan 
came to be known as "half the world", Isfahan <nisf-i-jahan>.

In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city, then the 
size of London, started to decline. The Afghans invaded; the Safavids 
fell from power; the capital went elsewhere; the desert encroached. 
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place, and now it is 
for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of 
old Persia and sometimes of the East. They think of it as a kind of 
spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.

Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky 
at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight. But even for them it 
remains a museum, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb, 
a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead. Everyone 
is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost no one is 
willing to acknowledge their present. It seems that for Persia, and 
especially for this city, there are only two times: the glorious past 
and the corrupt, depressing, sterile present. The one apparent connection 
between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other 
have survived and which naturally enough are called "historical monuments".

However, just as all the buildings have not fallen and 
flowed back to their original mud, so the values which wanted them 
and saw that they were built have not all disappeared. The values and 
talents which made the tile and the dome, the rug, the poem and the miniature, 
continue in certain social institutions which rise above the 
ordinary life of this city, as the great buildings rise above blank walls 
and dirty lanes. Often, too, the social institutions are housed 
in these pavilions and palaces and bridges, for these great structures 
are not simply "historical monuments"; they are the places where 
Persians live.   The promenade, for example, continues to take 
place on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees 
that now serves as the city's principal street. ?t takes place 
as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge, 
and also in the gardens of the square. On Fridays, the day when 
many Persians relax with poetry, talk, and a samovar, people do not, 
it is true, stream into Chehel Sotun- a pavilion and garden built 
by Shah Abbas /2, in the seventeenth century- but they do retire 
into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley, 
which are smaller, more humble copies of the former. And of course 
religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques, and commercial 
life- very much a social institution- in the bazaar. Those 
three other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the teahouse, 
and the <zur khaneh> (the latter a kind of club in which a leader 
and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics, 
dance, chanted poetry, and music), do not take place in buildings 
to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them occupy splendid 
examples of Persian domestic architecture: long, domed, chalk-white 
rooms with daises of turquoise tile, their end walls cut through 
to the orchards and the sky by open arches.   But more important, 
and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often 
do not see, is that these places and activities are often the settings 
in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities. 
Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the human form- these things 
are important to Persians, and they experience them with an intense 
and discriminating awareness.   I should like, by the way, to make 
it clear that I am not using the word "Persians" carelessly. 
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations, like 
a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool. These things 
are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to 
the most ordinary. The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's 
night are as often as not the <lutihaw,> mustachioed toughs 
who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons, brothels, 
and teahouses. A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord 
who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring 
famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor. Not long 
ago an acquaintance, a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw 
of the city, stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks. 
The air, he said, was just right; a cigarette would taste particularly 
good. I really didn't know what he meant. It was a nice day, 
granted. But <he> knew; he sniffed the air and licked it on his 
lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.   The natural world 
then, plus poetry and some kinds of art, receives from the most ordinary 
of Persians a great deal of attention. The line of an eyebrow, 
the color of the skin, a ghazal from Hafiz, the purity of spring water, 
the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of 
a pavilion- these things are noticed, judged, and valued.   Nowhere 
in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so 
well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge. There has probably 
always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the 
city. For one thing, there is a natural belt of rock across the river 
bed; for another, it was here that one of the old caravan routes came 
in. It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans, 
and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah Abbas /2, 
in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick, tile, and stone, the present 
bridge. It is a splendid structure. From upstream it looks like a 
long arcaded box laid across the river; from downstream, where the 
water level is much lower, it is a high, elaborately facaded pavilion.

The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from 
each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile. At either end and 
in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed 
and capacious as church apses. Here, in the old days- when they 
had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks- sat the king and 
his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged 
in the smaller alcoves between.   Below, twenty vaults tunnel 
through the understructure of the bridge. These are traversed by 
another line of vaults, and thus rooms, arched on all four sides, are 
formed. Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing 
vista like a visual echo of piers and arches, while the vaults fronting 
upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and 
river pools. Here, on the hottest day, it is cool beneath the stone 
and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the 
vaults.   On the downstream, or "pavilion", side these vaults 
give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself. From the 
terraces- eighteen in all- broad flights of steps descend into the 
water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river. 
Out of water, brick, and tile they have made far more than just a 
bridge.   On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops 
and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge. It 
is a great spectacle. The bridge itself rises up from the river, light-flared 
and enormous, like the outdoor set for an epic opera. Crowds 
press along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the arcades, 
massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege. All kinds 
come to walk in the promenade: merchants from the bazaar bickering 
over a deal; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket; dervishes 
who stand with the stillness of the blind, their eyes filmed with 
rheum and visions; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient 
limousines; students, civil servants, beggars, musicians, hawkers, 
and clowns. Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on 
carpets around a samovar. Below, people line the steps, as though on 
bleachers, to watch the sky and river. Above, in the tiled prosceniums 
of the alcoves, boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi, while at 
the very bottom, in the vaults, the toughs and blades of the city hoot 
and bang their drums, drink arak, play dice, and dance.   Here 
in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important 
to them: poetry, water, the moon, a beautiful face. To a stranger 
their delight in these things may seem paradoxical, for Persians chase 
the golden calf as much as any people. Many of them, moreover, are 
beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to 
ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant, the mullah, and the peasant. 
Nonetheless, they take time out- much time- from the game of 
grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks. 
Above all, they will stop in the middle of anything, anywhere, 
to hear or quote some poetry.   Poetry in Persian life is far
