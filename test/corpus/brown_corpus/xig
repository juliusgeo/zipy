
The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard 
provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric 
behavior. Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland 
Yard, Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality 
of the police. They for their part are convinced that Holmes 
is too "unorthodox" and "theoretical" to make a good detective. 
Why do the police find Holmes "unorthodox"? On the face of 
it, it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official 
police routine. Another, more interesting explanation, is hinted at by 
Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have 
made a magnificent criminal. The great detective modestly agrees. Watson's 
insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes 
and his arch-opponent, Dr& Moriarty. The two men resemble each other 
closely in their cunning, their egotism, their relentlessness. The 
first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty 
grappling together on the edge of a cliff. They are presumed 
to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace. Linked to Holmes 
even in death, Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great 
detective, the image of what our hero might have become were he not a 
public servant. Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the 
detective, so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both. ## 

IN the modern English "whodunnit", this insinuation of 
latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared. 
Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey (the respective creations 
of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers) have retained 
Holmes' 
egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits. Poirot and 
his counterparts are perfectly respectable people; it is true that 
they are also extremely dull. Their dedication to the status quo has 
been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism 
of a Sherlock Holmes. The latter's real descendents were unable 
to take root in England; they fled from the Victorian parlor 
and made their way across the stormy Atlantic. In the American "hardboiled" 
detective story of the '20s and '30s, the spirit of the 
mad genius from Baker Street lives on.   Like Holmes, the 
American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time. But 
unlike Holmes, he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt. 
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere, the "hardboiled" 
private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed 
isolation. His alienation is far more acute than Holmes'; he 
is not an eccentric but rather an outcast. With Rex Stout's Nero 
Wolfe, alienation is represented on a purely physical plane. Wolfe 
refuses to ever leave his own house, and spends most of his time drinking 
beer and playing with orchids. More profound and more disturbing, 
however, is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe. 
In a society where everything is for sale, Marlowe is the only 
man who cannot be bought. His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary 
and difficult existence. Beaten, bruised and exhausted, he pursues 
the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low 
morals, always alone, always despised. In the end, he gets his man, but 
no one seems to care; virtue is its own and only reward. A similar 
tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers 
of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery 
stories, Dashiell Hammett's <The Maltese Falcon>. Sam Spade 
joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled 
statue of a falcon; but when the bird is found at last, it turns 
out to be a fake. Now the detective must save his own skin by informing 
on the girl he loves, who is also the real murderer. For Sam Spade, 
neither crime nor virtue pays; moreover, it is increasingly difficult 
to distinguish between the two.   Because the private eye 
intends to save society in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself 
in trouble with the police. The latter are either too stupid to 
catch the killer or too corrupt to care. In either case, they do not 
appreciate the private detective's zeal. Perry Mason and Hamilton 
Burger, Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting 
each other than they do in looking for the criminal. Frequently enough, 
the police are themselves in league with the killer; Dashiell 
Hammett's 
<Red Harvest> provides a classic example of this theme. 
But even when the police are honest, they do not trust the private 
eye. He is, like Phillip Marlowe, too alienated to be reliable. Finally, 
in <The Maltese Falcon> among others, the clash between detective 
and police is carried to its logical conclusion: Sam Spade 
becomes the chief murder suspect. In order to exonerate himself, he 
is compelled to find the real criminal, who happens to be his girl friend. 
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes 
now appears as a direct accusation: the private eye is in danger of 
turning into his opposite. ##

IT IS the growing contradiction 
between individualism and public service in the mystery story which 
creates this fatal dilemma. By upholding his own personal code of behavior, 
the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society 
whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption. That society 
responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo, 
a potential criminal. If the detective insists upon retaining his 
personal standards, he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society. 
He must, in short, cease to be a detective and become a rebel. 
On the other hand, if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession, 
he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism. 
Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write 
mystery 
stories and turning to other pursuits. His successors have adopted 
the opposite alternative. In order to save the mystery story, they 
have converted the private detective into an organization man.

The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by 
Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer. At first glance, this hero seems 
to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors. 
For Hammer, nothing is forbidden. He kills when he pleases, 
takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge, jury 
and executioner rolled into one. 
It will be shown that the <objectives> of the cooperative people in 
an organization determine the type of <network> required, because the 
type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages 
enumerated in Table 1. Great stress is placed on the role that 
the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness 
of the network. By monitoring, we mean some system of control 
over the types of information sent from the various centers. 
As a word of caution, we should be aware that in actual practice no 
message is purely one of the four types, question, command, statement, 
or exclamation. For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving 
a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk, "What 
time is it"? This sentence would have most of the characteristics 
of a question, but it has some of the characteristics of a statement 
because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in 
his own timepiece or the one attached to his car. If the man on the 
sidewalk is surprised at this question, it has served as an exclamation. 
Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer 
(and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer) the question 
has assumed some measurable properties of a command. However, for 
convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified 
according to Table 1. On this basis, certain extreme kinds of networks 
will be discussed for illustrative purposes. 

#NETWORKS ILLUSTRATING 
SOME SPECIAL TYPES OF ORGANIZATION#

_THE COCKTAIL PARTY._ 
Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire 
to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted 
and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy 
for future cooperative endeavors. The party is usually in a room 
small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another. 
The information is furnished by each of the guests, is sent by 
oral broadcasting over the air waves, and is received by the ears. Since 
the air is a continuum, the network of communication remains intact 
regardless of the positions or motions of the points (the people) 
in the net. As shown in Figure 1, there is a connection for communication 
between every pair of points. This, and other qualifications, make 
the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication 
system ever dreamed up. All four types of message listed in Table 
1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding 
the commands to a minimum, while <exclamations> having complimentary 
intonations are more than customarily encouraged. The completeness 
of the connections provide that, for ~<N> people, there are **f 
lines of communication between the pairs, which can become a large number 
(1,225) for a party of fifty guests. Looking at the diagram, we 
see that **f connection lines come in to each member. Thus the cocktail 
party would appear to be the ideal system, but there is one weakness. 
In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group, the 
**f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond 
comprehension if ~<N> exceeds about six. The crowd consequently 
breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six, with 
a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.

For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else 
and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers, then 
the "open house" system is advantageous because the honored guests 
are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections 
at the door. _THE RURAL COMMUNITY._ We consider a rural 
community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration 
is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary 
for family subsistence. We assume for this illustration that the 
size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings 
is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication 
is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2. Information 
beyond nearest neighbor is carried second-, third-, and fourth-hand 
as a distortable rumor. In Figure 2, the points in the network are 
designated by a letter accompanied by a number. The numbers indicate 
the number of nearest neighbors. It will be noted that point ~<f> 
has seven nearest neighbors, ~<h> and ~<e> have six, and ~<p> 
has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate numbers. 
In any social system in which communications have an importance 
comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point 
like ~<f> in Figure 2 would (other things being equal) be the dwelling 
place for the community leader, while ~<e> and ~<h> would 
house the next most important citizens. A point like ~<p> gets 
information directly from ~<n>, but all information beyond ~<n> 
is indirectly relayed through ~<n>. The dweller at ~<p> is 
last to hear about a new cure, the slowest to announce to his neighbors 
his urgent distresses, the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the 
one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or 
getting people to join him in a cooperative effort. Since the hazards 
of poor communication are so great, ~<p> can be justified as a habitable 
site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made 
available by a waterfall for milling purposes, a mine, or a sugar maple 
camp. Location theorists have given these matters much consideration. 
_MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS._ The networks for military communications 
are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be 
changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the 
addition of new machines of war. They also furnish proof that, in 
modern war, message sending must be monitored. Without monitoring, a 
military hookup becomes a noisy party. The need for monitoring became 
greater when radio was adopted for military signaling. Alexander the 
Great, who used runners as message carriers, did not have to worry about 
having every officer in his command hear what he said and having 
hundreds of them comment at once. As time has passed and science has
