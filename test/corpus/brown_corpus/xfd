and oriented for best operation, and this can mean savings both in the 
size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.   If you 
can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building, 
by all means <make provision for its easy adding later>. Manufacturers 
have designed equipment for just such circumstances, and your 
savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.   If your 
house is to have a forced warm air system, cooling can be a part of 
it. This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system, 
for your regular heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double 
duty for cooling. You can get year-'round air conditioners in the 
same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone- high or 
low boy, horizontal or counterflow. The units can be installed in basement, 
attic, crawlspace, or in a closet located in the living area. The 
cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet. From the coil 
small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set 
in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.   If you plan to add 
cooling later to your heating system, there are things to watch for. 
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed. 
They may be inaccessible later. <Be sure your ducts and blower are 
big enough to handle cooling>. This is especially important if you 
live in a mild-winter zone. <Be sure you get a perimeter heating system>, 
and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for 
heating.   You can get a hot water system that will also work 
for cooling your house. For cooling, chilled water is circulated instead 
of hot water. Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating 
units, each with its own thermostat. These systems are more expensive 
than year-'round forced air systems. The minimum cost for an average 
one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to run $1500 above 
the cost of the heating alone. _SEPARATE SYSTEMS._ If the problems 
of combining cooling with your heating are knotty, it may be cheaper 
to plan on a completely separate cooling system. The simplest kind 
of separate system uses a single, self-contained unit. It is, in effect, 
an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts 
to distribute the cooled, cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.

In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be installed, 
one serving the living area, the other the sleeping zone. In a two-story 
house, one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first 
floor, another in the attic to cool the second. In each case, having 
separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of 
permitting individual zone control. _THE HEAT PUMP._ One of the 
more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched 
to heating. As you know, a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping 
the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors. A relatively 
simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine 
literally runs backward, and the heat is extracted from outdoor air 
and turned indoors.   Up until recently, this heat pump method 
of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when 
outside temperatures were above 40 degrees. Now, the machine has been 
improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat 
at temperatures down to 15 degrees. You can get this added heating 
feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.

Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost, for those 
emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard holds up fuel delivery, 
or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start 
up your whole heating plant. _WHAT SIZE CONDITIONER?_ How large 
a cooling unit you need, and the method of its installation, depends 
on a variety of factors. Among other things, besides the nature of 
your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from 
the outside, it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup 
of your family. Families with children usually don't want the house 
quite so cool. If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity. 
The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can easily double 
your cooling load.   Cooling requirements are best expressed in 
terms of ~BTU's. A ~BTU is a unit of heat, and the ~BTU 
rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can 
pump <out> of your house in an hour. A very rough rule of thumb is 
that, under favorable conditions, you'll need 15 ~BTU's of cooling 
for every square foot of your house. This is if outdoor temperatures 
have a high average of 95 degrees. You'll need more if the high 
average is above that, less if it's below.   Coolers are also 
rated by tons. A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by 
melting a ton of ice. By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will 
provide 12,000 ~BTU of cooling in one hour.   You may find 
a conditioner rated by horsepower. It is generally an inaccurate 
method of rating, for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor, 
and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll 
get. A 1-~hp conditioner, for example, may vary in effectiveness 
from under 8,000 ~BTU to well over 10,000 ~BTU.   The 
safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit 
you need, rather than trying to do this yourself.   Don't urge 
your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be 
sure you have enough. Better to have your equipment slightly undersized 
than too big. Here's why:   Reducing humidity is often 
as important as cooling. An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly, 
then shut down for a long period. Before it cycles on again, humidity 
can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature 
is still low. With a unit of the right size, a compressor will 
run continuously during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as it 
does temperature. _MONEY-SAVING TIPS._ Attention to details can 
cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately. 
A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled 
and heated for as little as $128 a year, or $11 a month. 
If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily, your unit 
will have less heat to remove. Keep the direct sun from reaching the 
house and you've won the first battle. In a new house, generous roof 
overhangs are a logical and effective solution. If the house you plan 
to buy or build won't have big overhangs, you can still do a fair 
job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed 
trellises, fences and awnings.   Shade trees, too, are a big help, 
so keep them if you can. Drawn blinds and draperies do some good, 
but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.

The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof, the greater 
its heat impact. The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence 
how much cooling you're going to need. A shift in the walls, 
or a change in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely, can 
save you money.   You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the 
sun, double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation. <Restrict 
large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house>. 
They're easier to shade there. An attic space above insulation makes 
a house easier to cool. You'll even gain by putting your water 
heater outside the conditioned space, and using an electric range instead 
of a gas one. Gas adds to the moisture load.   Insulate, weatherstrip, 
double-glaze to the maximum. In insulation, the numbers to 
remember are 6-4-2. They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation 
in the ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the floors. 
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling 
installation, but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in 
heating and cooling. A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 
per cent.   It costs two to three times as much to remove a ~BTU 
in summer as it does to add one in winter, so every solitary ~BTU 
is worth attention. You'll foil them in droves, along with 
their pal humidity, by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a 
bathroom ventilator for when you shower, and an outside vent for the 
clothes drier. _KEEPING CONDITIONERS QUIET._ It's no use pretending 
that all conditioners are quiet, but the noise they produce can 
be kept to a minimum. Good workmanship is important in the installation, 
so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award the job on 
the basis of price alone.   Avoid attic placement directly above 
a bedroom.

MOST RECREATION WORK calls for a good deal of pre-planning. 
This is particularly true in site selection. You must know before 
you start what the needs and objectives of your organtion are; you 
must have a list of requirements on where, how many, and what type sites 
are needed. With such a program you can make constructive selections 
of the best sites available.   Begin the examination of a site 
with a good map and aerial photos if possible. These are becoming more 
and more available through the work of counties and other government 
agencies. The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal 
government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural 
features of the site. These are inexpensive and available from the U& 
S& Geological Society, Washington 25, D& C&. In recent 
years many counties and the U& S& Forest Service have taken 
aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning 
use. Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer 
showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office 
showing ownerships of land.   Inspect the site in the field during 
the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for 
recreation. This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the 
climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the water interests, 
etcetera, which vary greatly with the seasons. It is usually helpful 
to make a sketch map in the field, showing the size and location 
of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site. These 
are a great aid for planning use back at the office. ##

FOR 
SITE PLANNING WORK, it is best to have a qualified and experienced 
park planner to carry through the study. However, there is also much 
to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are 
available and interested in recreation. County judges, commissioners, 
engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a 
long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions 
to offer from their varied professional experiences. A visit to the site 
by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify 
opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.

How much study is required? This, of course, depends on 
the character of the site itself, the previous experience of the investigator, 
and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision. 
It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick 
judgment 
of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone. Usually 
there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions. 
A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance 
today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little 
development or water. The same is true of areas which at first look 
good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually 
be poor areas to develop for general public use.   In looking for 
the best sites available that meet the requirements, you need information 
to compare the site with others. You need answers to four important 
questions.   @ What are the existing recreation features?

@ How well can the site be developed?   @ How useful 
will it be to the public?   @ Is this site available?

Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests 
already existing at the site. Naturally, a park site with scenic 
views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes, will attract more people 
than a nearby area with only trees and dunes. Quality is vitally important. 
Frontage on a body of clear, clean water will be vastly different 
from the same amount of frontage on polluted water. Some recreation 
features, such as scenic values and water interest, also have greater 
overall value than other interests.   One of the most desirable 
features for a park are beautiful views or scenery. It may be distant 
views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a 
small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual trees. A site which
