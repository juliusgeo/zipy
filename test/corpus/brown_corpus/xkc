past. But he, as I can now retort, was the man who could see so 
short a distance ahead that after a visit to Russia he gave voice to 
the famous exclamation: "I have seen the future and it works".

The favorite excuse of those who have now recanted their approval 
of communism is that they did not know how things would develop. With 
this excuse I have never been much impressed. There was, it seems 
to me, enough in the openly declared principles and intentions of Russian 
leaders to alienate honorable men without their having to wait 
to see how it would turn out.   Once many years ago I sat at dinner 
next to Arthur Train, and the subject of the <Nation> came 
up. He asked me suddenly, "What are <your> political opinions"? 
"Well", I replied, "some of my colleagues on the paper regard 
me as a rank reactionary". After a moment's thought he replied, 
"That still leaves you a lot of latitude". And I suppose it 
did.   I never have been, and am not now, any kind of utopian. When 
I first came across Samuel Johnson's pronouncement, "the remedy 
for the ills of life is palliative rather than radical", it seemed 
to me to sum up the profoundest of political and social truths. It 
will probably explain more of my attitudes toward society than any 
other phrase or principle could. ##

Why did I choose to fill these 
pages in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous 
reflections and autobiography? The reason is, I think, my awareness 
that my remarks last quarter on pacifism may well have served to confirm 
the opinion of some that my tendency to skepticism and dissent gets 
us nowhere, and that I am simply too old to hope. I would, however, 
like to suggest that, wrong though I may be, the tendency to see 
dilemmas rather than solutions is one of which I have been a victim ever 
since I can remember, and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon. 
I know that one must act. But one need not always be sure that the 
action is either wise or conclusive.   Apropos of what some would 
call cynicism, I remember an anecdote the source of which I forget. 
It concerns a small-town minister who staged an impressive object 
lesson by confining a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside 
his church door. Not only his parishioners, but the whole town and, 
ultimately, the whole county were enormously impressed by this object 
lesson. One day he was visited by a delegation of would-be imitators 
who wanted to know his secret. "How on earth do you manage it? 
What is the trick"? "Why", he replied, "it is perfectly simple; 
there is no trick involved. All you have to do is put in a fresh 
lamb from time to time". Cynical? Blasphemous? Not really, 
it seems to me. The promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down 
together was given in the future tense. It is not something that can 
be expected to happen now. ##

Without really changing the general 
subject, I take this opportunity to confess that I am troubled by 
doubts, not only about pacifism, but also when asked to join in the protest 
against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane 
and liberal seem to regard as obviously barbarous; namely, the law 
that prescribes the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no 
extenuating circumstances. It is not that I am unaware of the force 
of their strongest contention. Life, they say, should be regarded as 
sacred and, therefore, as something that neither an individual nor his 
society has a right to take away. In fact I cannot imagine myself 
condemning a man to the noose or the electric chair if I had to take, 
as an individual, the responsibility for his death. Just as I know 
I would make a bad soldier even though I cannot sincerely call myself 
a pacifist, so too I would not be either a hangman by profession or, 
if I could avoid it, even a member of a hanging jury. Despite these 
facts the question "Should no murderer ever be executed"? seems 
to me to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily disposed of by a 
simple negative answer.   Punishment of the wrongdoer, so liberals 
are inclined to say, can have only three possible justifications: 
revenge, reformation or deterrent example. 
For here if anywhere in contemporary literature is a major effort to 
counterbalance Existentialism and restore some of its former lustre to 
the tarnished image of the species Man, or, as Malraux himself puts 
it, "to make men conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves".

Andre Malraux's <The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> 
was written in the early years of the second World War, during 
a period of enforced leisure when he was taken prisoner by the Germans 
after the fall of France. The manuscript, presumably after being 
smuggled out of the country, was published in Switzerland in 1943. 
The work as it stands is not the entire book that Malraux wrote at that 
time- it is only the first section of a three-part novel called 
<La Lutte avec l'Ange;> and this first section was somehow preserved 
(there are always these annoying little mysteries about the actual 
facts of Malraux's life) when the Gestapo destroyed the rest. 
If we are to believe the list of titles printed in Malraux's latest 
book, <La Metamorphose des Dieux,> Vol& /1, (1957), he is 
still 
engaged in writing a large novel under his original title. But as he 
remarks in his preface to <The Walnut Trees,> "a novel can hardly 
ever be rewritten", and "when this one appears in its final form, 
the form of the first part **h will no doubt be radically changed". 
Malraux pretends, perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty, 
that his fragmentary work will accordingly "appeal only to the 
curiosity of bibliophiles" 
and "to connoisseurs of what might have 
been". Even in its present form, however, the first part of Malraux's 
unrecoverable novel is among the greatest works of mid-twentieth 
century literature; and it should be far better known than it is.

The theme of <The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> is most closely 
related to its immediate predecessor in Malraux's array of novels: 
<Man's Hope> (1937). This magnificent but greatly underestimated 
book, which bodies forth the very form and pressure of its time 
as no other comparable creation, has suffered severely from having 
been written about an historical event- the Spanish Civil War- 
that is still capable of fanning the smoldering fires of old political 
feuds. Even so apparently impartial a critic as W& H& Frohock 
has taken for granted that the book was originally intended as a piece 
of Loyalist propaganda; and has then gone on to argue, with unimpeachable 
consistency, that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspects 
of the book are simply inadvertent "contradictions".   Nothing, 
however, could be farther from the truth. The whole purpose of 
<Man's Hope> is to portray the tragic dialectic between means and 
ends inherent in all organized political violence- and even when such 
violence is a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty, justice 
and human dignity. Nowhere before in Malraux's pages have we 
met such impassioned defenders of a "quality of man" which transcends 
the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether- 
both the action of Malraux's early anarchist-adventurers like Perken 
and Garine, and the self-sacrificing action of dedicated Communists 
like Kyo Gisors and Katow in <Man's Fate>. "Man engages 
only a small part of himself in an action" says old Alvear the art-historian; 
"and the more the action claims to be total, the smaller 
is the part of man engaged". These lines never cease to haunt 
the book amidst all the exaltations of combat, and to make an appeal for 
a larger and more elemental human community than one based on the brutal 
necessities of war.   It is this larger theme of the "quality 
of man", a quality that transcends the ideological and flows into 
"the human", which now forms the pulsating heart of Malraux's 
artistic universe. Malraux, to be sure, does not abandon the world 
of violence, combat and sudden death which has become his hallmark as 
a creative artist, and which is the only world, apparently, in which 
his imagination can flame into life. <The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> 
includes not one war but two, and throws in a Turkish revolution 
along with some guerrilla fighting in the desert for good measure. But 
while war still serves as a catalyst for the values that Malraux wishes 
to express, these values are no longer linked with the triumph or 
defeat of any cause- whether that of an individual assertion of the 
will-to-power, or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation 
of oppression- as their necessary condition. On the contrary, the 
frenzy and furor of combat is only the sombre foil against which the 
sudden illuminations of the human flash forth with the piercing radiance 
of a Caravaggio. #/2,#

<The Walnut Trees of Altenburg> 
is composed in the form of a triptych, with the two small side panels 
framing and enclosing the main central episode of the novel. This 
central episode consists of a series of staccato scenes set in the period 
from the beginning of the present century up to the first World War. 
The framing scenes, on the other hand, both take place in the late 
Spring of 1940, just at the moment of the defeat of France in the 
second great world conflict. The narrator is an Alsatian serving with 
the French Army, and he has the same name (Berger) that Malraux 
himself was later to use in the Resistance; like Malraux he was also 
serving in the tank corps before being captured, and we learn as well 
that in civilian life he had been a writer. These biographical analogies 
are obvious, and far too much time has been spent speculating 
on their possible implications.   Much more important is to grasp 
the feelings of the narrator (whose full name is never given) as he 
becomes aware of the disorganized and bewildered mass of French prisoners 
clustered together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral 
of Chartres. For as his companions gradually dissolve back 
into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity, as they 
lose all the appanage of their acquired culture, he is overcome by 
the feeling that he is at last being confronted with the essence of mankind. 
"As a writer, by what have I been obsessed these last ten 
years, if not by mankind? Here I am face to face with the primeval 
stuff".   The intuition about mankind conveyed in these opening 
pages is of crucial importance for understanding the remainder of 
the text; and we must attend to it more closely than has usually been 
done. What does the narrator see and what does he feel? A good many 
pages of the first section are taken up with an account of the dogged 
determination of the prisoners to write to their wives and families- 
even when it becomes clear that the Germans are simply allowing 
the letters to blow away in the wind. Awkwardly and laboriously, in stiff, 
unemotional phrases, the soldiers continue to bridge the distance 
between themselves and those they love; they instinctively struggle 
to keep open a road to the future in their hearts. And by a skillful 
and unobtrusive use of imagery (the enclosure is called a "Roman-camp 
stockade", the hastily erected lean-to is a "Babylonian hovel", 
the men begin to look like "Peruvian mummies" and to acquire 
"Gothic faces"), Malraux projects a fresco of human endurance- 
which is also the endurance of the human- stretching backward into 
the dark abyss of time. The narrator feels himself catching a glimpse 
of pre-history, learning of man's "age-old familiarity with misfortune", 
as well as his "equally age-old ingenuity, his secret 
faith in endurance, however crammed with catastrophes, the same faith 
perhaps as the cave-men used to have in the face of famine". 
This new vision of man that the narrator acquires is also accompanied 
by a re-vision of his previous view. "I thought I knew more than 
my education had taught me" notes the narrator, "because I had encountered 
the militant mobs of a political or religious faith". Is 
this not Malraux himself alluding to his own earlier infatuation with 
the ideological? But now he knows "that an intellectual is not only 
a man to whom books are necessary, he is any man whose reasoning, 
however elementary it may be, affects and directs his life". From this 
point of view the "militant mobs" of the past, stirred into action 
by one ideology or another, were all composed of "intellectuals"- 
and this is not the level on which the essence of mankind can be 
discovered. The men around him, observes the narrator, "have been 
living from day to day for thousands of years". The human is deeper
