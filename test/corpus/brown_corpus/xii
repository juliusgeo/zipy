title of one of his books as THE REVOLT OF THE MODERATES. He opens 
his discourse, however, with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural 
festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents, 
all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age. The 
show was colorful, indeed, exuberant, but the press for all its assiduity 
could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.

Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue. 
And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation: "In essence 
the drama of his (Eisenhower's) Presidency can be described 
as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling- thus far 
with but limited and precarious success- to give effective voice 
and force to that conservatism".   I will assume that we are 
all aware of the continuing struggle, with its limited and precarious 
success, toward conservatism. It has moved on various levels, it has 
been clamorous and confused. Obviously there has been no agreement on 
what American conservatism is, or rather, what it should be. For it 
was neglected, not to say nascent, when the struggle began. I saw a 
piece the other day assailing William Buckley, author of MAN AND 
GOD AT YALE and publisher of the <National Review>, as no conservative 
at all, but an old liberal. I would agree with this view. But 
I'm not here to define conservatism.   What I am here to do 
is to report on the gyrations of the struggle- a struggle that amounts 
to self-redefinition- to see if we can predict its future course.

One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of 
the last election, I suppose, is that we, the majority, were dissatisfied 
with Eisenhower conservatism. Though, to be sure, we gave Kennedy 
no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment. 
This is, however, symptomatic of our national malaise. But before I 
try to diagnose it, I would offer other evidence. I will mention two 
volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year. 
The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise, sponsored by <Life> 
magazine, under the title of <the National purpose>. The contributors 
to this testament were all well-known: a former Democratic 
candidate for President, a New Deal poet, the magazine's chief 
editorial writer, two newspaper columnists, head of a national broadcasting 
company, a popular Protestant evangelist, etc&. What I want 
to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals, or modified liberals, 
with perhaps one exception. I suppose we might classify Billy 
Graham as an old liberal. And I would further note that they all- 
with one exception again- sang in one key or another the same song. 
Its refrain was: "Let us return to the individualistic democracy 
of our forefathers for our salvation".   Adlai Stevenson 
expressed some reservations about this return. Others invoked technology 
and common sense. Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility 
of our having "outlived most of what we used to regard as the program 
of our national purposes".   But the most notable thing about 
the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth 
of <socialism> was conspicuously absent.   The second specific 
comment was the report of Eisenhower's Commission on National 
Goals, titled GOALS FOR AMERICANS. They, perhaps, gave the pitch 
of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower 
requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly 
of Columbia University, because it was <non-partisan>. The 
Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the 
<unconscious> liberal, but not unconscious enough, to invoke the now 
taboo symbolism of socialism. And here again we hear the same refrain 
mentioned above: "The paramount goal of the United States 
**h set long ago **h was to guard the rights of the individual **h ensure 
his development **h enlarge his opportunity". This group is secularist 
and their program tends to be technological.   But it is 
the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as 
symptom of the common man's malaise. And let me add Murray's new 
book as another symptom of it, particularly so in view of the attention 
TIME magazine gave it when it came out recently. Father Murray 
goes back to the Declaration of Independence, too, though I may 
add, with considerably more historical perception.   I will reserve 
discussion of it for a moment, however, to return to President Kennedy. 
As symptomatic of the common man's malaise, he is most significant: 
a liberal and a Catholic, elected by the skin of his teeth. 
Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy, not to say confused, 
state of the public mind?   What is the common man's 
complaint? Let's take a panoramic look back over the course we 
have come. Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism 
up until the turning back under Eisenhower? And the basic character 
of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic. Ralph 
Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress. But 
there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook.

DOES our society have a runaway, uncontrollable growth of 
technology which may end our civilization, or a normal, healthy growth? 
Here there may be an analogy with cancer: we can detect cancers 
by their rapidly accelerating growth, determinable only when related 
to the more normal rate of healthy growth. Should the accelerating 
growth of technology then warn us? Noting such evidence is the first 
step; and almost the only "cure" is <early> detection and removal. 
One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology 
would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their 
functioning is as healthy as before. So an objective look at our 
present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous 
situation. In any event, whether society may have cancer, or merely 
a virus infection, the "disease", we shall find, is political, 
economical, social, and even medical. Have not our physical abilities 
already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now 
living? Hence the prime issue, as I see it, is whether a democratic 
or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind, 
or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible 
with <its> own needs as a force of nature.   We are already committed 
to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere 
on earth, not merely in the limited social-political-economical context 
we are fond of today. Otherwise, we go on endlessly trying to draw 
the line, color and other, as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate. 
We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to 
contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is 
to be extremely shortsighted, if nothing else. We must believe we have 
the ability to affect our own destinies: otherwise why try anything? 
So in these pages the term "technology" is used to include any 
and all means which could amplify, project, or augment man's control 
over himself and over other men. Naturally this includes all communication 
forms, e&g& languages, or any social, political, economic 
or religious structures employed for such control. Properly mindful 
of <all> the cultures in existence today throughout the world, we must 
employ these resources without war or violent revolution.   If 
we were creating a wholly new society, we could insist that our social, 
political, economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than 
hamper man; best growth. But we cannot start off with a clean slate. 
So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to 
the effect of each on man's major needs. Asked which institution 
most needs correction, I would say the corporation as it exists in America 
today. At first glance this appears strange: of all people, 
was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new 
way of life still inspiring "undeveloped" societies abroad? But 
hear Harrison E& Salisbury, former Moscow correspondent of The 
New York Times, and author of "To Moscow- And Beyond". 
In a book review of "The Soviet Cultural Offensive", he says, 
"Long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into 
an East-West Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive 
within Soviet borders, the sharp cutting-edge of American 
culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes, as when the enterprising 
promoters of 'Porgy and Bess' overrode the State Department 
to carry the contemporary 'cultural warfare' behind the 
enemy lines. They were not diplomats or jazz musicians, or even organizers 
of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays, but rugged capitalist 
entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Hugh Cooper, Thomas Campbell, 
the International Harvester Co&, and David W& Griffith. Their 
kind created an American culture superior to any in the world, an 
industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did 
almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal 
treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or 
program a series of consultations of interested agencies. This favorable 
image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still 
there despite years of energetic anti-American propaganda **h" 

#CORPORATIONS NOW OUTMODED#

Perhaps the public's present attitude 
toward business stems from the fact that the "rugged capitalist entrepreneur" 
no more exists in America. In his stead is a milquetoast 
version known as "the corporation". But even if we cannot see 
the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America, foreigners 
can; and our loss of "prestige" abroad is the direct result. 
No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts. If we want respect 
from ourselves or others, we will have to earn it. First, let us 
realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times, now 
the corporation <per se> cannot take economic leadership. Businesses 
must develop as a result of the ideas, energies and ambitions of an 
individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within <one> mind. 
When we "forced" individuals to assume the corporate structure 
by means of taxes and other legal statutes, we adopted what I would 
term "pseudo-capitalism" and so took a major step toward socialism. 
The biggest loss, of course, was the individual's lessened desire 
and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and 
our economy. Socialism, I grant, has a definite place in our society. 
But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to 
a form that is not truly capitalistic. Some forms of capitalism do indeed 
work- superb organizations, a credit to any society. But the pseudo-capitalism 
which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics 
and social life, will not stand close scrutiny. Its pretense to operate 
in the public interest is little more than a sham. It serves 
only its own stockholders and poorly at that. As a creative enterprise, 
its abilities are primarily in "swallowing" creative enterprises 
developed outside its own organization (an ability made possible by 
us, and almost mandatory). As to benefits to employees, it is notorious 
for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services.

The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism, 
vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged 
within governmental bureaucracy. But while the corporation has all 
the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization (so cumbersome 
it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its 
need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo), unluckily it 
does not have the desirable aspect of socialism, the motivation to operate 
for the benefit of society as a whole. So we are faced with a 
vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever 
manner they can, without regard to the needs of society, controlling 
society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's 
needs for survival.   The corporation has a limited, specific 
place in our society. Ideally speaking, it should be allowed to operate 
only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply 
or services, and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary 
to the needs of society. Examples are in public utilities, making 
military aircraft and accessories, or where the investment and risk 
for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible 
to achieve by any means other than the corporate form, e&g& 
constructing major airports or dams. Thus, if corporations are not 
to run away with us, they must become quasi-governmental institutions, 
subject to public control and needs. In all other areas, private initiative 
of the "proprietorship" type should be urged to produce the 
desired goods and services.
