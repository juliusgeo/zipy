a broad line of elaborately controlled knee-type and manufacturing type 
milling machines. In the grinding machine field, expansion went far 
from universal grinders alone and took in cylindrical grinders, surface 
grinders, and a wide variety of special and semi-special models.

In 1951, Henry D& Sharpe, Jr& succeeded his father and 
continued 
the company's development as a major factor in the metal-working 
equipment business. The company is still broadening its line and 
is now active on four major fronts.   The Machine Tool Division 
is currently producing Brown + Sharpe single spindle automatic screw 
machines, grinding machines of many types, and knee and bed-type 
milling machines. Recently added is the Brown + Sharpe turret drilling 
machine which introduces the company to an entirely new field of tool 
development.   In the Industrial Products Division, the company 
manufactures and markets a wide line of precision gaging and inspection 
equipment, machinists' tools- including micrometers, Vernier 
calipers, and accessories.   In the Cutting Tool Division, 
the principal products include a wide variety of high speed steel milling 
cutters, end mills and saws. 
Sales and net income for the year ended December 31, 1960 showed an 
improvement over 1959. Net income was $2,557,111, or $3.11 per share 
on 821,220 common shares currently outstanding, as compared to $2,323,867 
or $2.82 per share in 1959, adjusted to the same number of shares.

Sales and other operating income increased 25.1% from $24,926,615 
in 1959 to $31,179,816 in 1960. This increase was sufficient to 
overcome the effect on net income of higher costs of manufacture and 
increased expenditures on research and development.   In spite 
of the fact that our largest market, the textile industry, was affected 
substantially by the current decline in business activity, we have 
been able to produce and deliver our machines throughout the year 1960 
at a rate materially higher than during 1959. 

#OUTLOOK FOR CURRENT 
YEAR#

Our current rate of incoming orders has now contracted and 
unless this trend can be reversed, our production for 1961 will be lower 
than for 1960.   However, the healthy inventory position of 
the textile industry lends support to the broadly expressed belief that 
improvement in that industry can be expected by the second half of 1961. 

#NEED FOR SOUND TAX POLICY#

In connection with our continuing 
development of new and more efficient mill machinery, a sounder U& 
S& income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment, enabling 
the mills to charge off the cost of new machines on a more realistic 
basis, could, if adopted, have favorable effects on Leesona's 
business in the next few years.   Such a depreciation policy would 
also, we believe, prove a very important factor in strengthening the 
competitive position of the U& S& textile and other industries, 
thus helping to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange. 

#RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT#

Our research and development program, 
serving as it does an industry which must compete against low-cost 
production throughout the world, continues to have primary emphasis 
at Leesona.   This program is based on the policy of designing 
and building efficient machines which will help produce better textile 
values- fabrics whose cost in relation to quality, fashion and utility 
provide the consumer with better textile products for the money.

Such policy involves continuing effort to improve on existing 
mill equipment, in terms of efficiency and versatility. But more important, 
we believe, it must concentrate on the development of entirely 
new concepts in textile processing as do the Unifil loom winder and 
our more recent Uniconer automatic coning machine. 

#BUDGET INCREASED# 

On this basis, our already substantial budget for research and 
development has been further increased in recent years in order to finance 
the continuing engineering and design work essential to Leesona's 
future growth in sales and earnings.   Much of this necessary 
increase in research and development, though properly chargeable to 
current expenses, is not reflected in earnings until projects are completed 
and the new machines sold in quantity, usually over a period of 
several years. 

#STRETCH YARN MACHINES#

In December we began to 
ship our ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machines. These machines produce 
the higher quality stretch yarns required in weaving stretch and textured 
fabrics. During the past year, great progress has been made by 
the weaving mills in creating new stretch and textured fabrics. Fashion 
centers are now predicting broad acceptance of sports apparel and 
improved "wash and wear" dresses and blouses made from these fabrics.

This machine, operating at speeds up to 350,000 revolutions 
per minute, is believed to provide one of the fastest mechanical operations 
in industry today. It transfers yarn directly from the producers' 
largest package into ideal supply packages for use on Unifil loom 
winders in weaving stretch yarn fabrics. 

#LARGE-PACKAGE TWISTER# 

Our new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarns is performing 
well in our customers' mills. Later in the year, additional types 
of this Leesona twister will be made available to mills for other 
man-made fibers and natural yarns. These machines are designed to provide 
higher operating speeds, larger yarn packages, and greater flexibility 
of application to different types of yarn. This we believe will 
substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment. 

#UNICONER# 

Major activity at Providence in 1961 will involve the scheduled 
completion of tooling for production of the Uniconer automatic 
coning machine. This work is progressing on schedule and we expect to 
make initial shipments in the fourth quarter of this year. This machine 
was demonstrated in two textile machinery exhibitions last year and 
was well received by the industry. The potential market for the machine 
should be comparable to that of the Unifil loom winder.   The 
Uniconer has several outstanding features- it operates with much 
greater efficiency than existing equipment; it incorporates an automatic 
knot-tying device on each spindle, and it will knot a break in 
the yarn in 10 seconds as well as tie in new bobbins as the running end 
is exhausted.   Because the bobin-to-cone winding process is a 
relatively high-cost operation for the mill, the almost complete automation 
provided by the Uniconer can mean important economies in textile 
production, at the same time upgrading quality. Many mills have already 
placed firm orders for this machine. 

#NEW UNIFIL APPLICATION# 

A new application for the Unifil loom winder, running single filling 
for box looms, will broaden mill use of this equipment. 

#TAKE-UP 
MACHINES#

A new spinning take-up machine has been developed to facilitate 
the use of our take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic 
yarns. It is equipped with electronic controls that can be set to 
hold precise tension and speed.   This new machine takes up filament 
yarn from spinneret or extruder and winds large packages at speeds 
up to 6,000 feet per minute. It is equipped with an automatic threading 
device to reduce waste and handling time.   Our take-up machines 
and our twister-coners are undergoing important pilot plant testing 
for application with new high polymer yarns, in several fiber producing 
plants. We look forward to a stronger position in this expanding 
field. 

#DIVERSIFICATION PLANS#

We are interested in further diversification 
into other fields of capital goods, or components for industrial 
products, and have recently intensified our efforts in that direction. 

#PATTERSON MOOS RESEARCH#

Our Patterson Moos Research 
Division has made further very encouraging progress in development of 
fuel cells. The cooperation of our exclusive American licensee, Pratt 
+ Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft Corporation, 
has been important in this work. In addition to its major effort on fuel 
cells, Patterson Moos Research Division is continuing to carry 
on research in other fields, both under contract for the Defense Department, 
other government agencies and for our own account. ~PMR 
is currently supplying components vital to the Titan and Minuteman 
programs.   We have recently entered into an agreement with Compagnie 
Generale de Telegraphie Sans Fil (~CSF) of France for 
the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric materials. 
The agreement gives us rights for manufacturing and marketing 
of such materials in the United States. Initially we will import the 
thermoelectric materials and modules from France but later we will 
manufacture in this country. There is a rapidly growing demand for this 
material, primarily from the military. Further research, we believe, 
will develop important commercial applications.   A project for 
the Air Force has been completed in which the ~NAIR infrared 
detecting device was developed for area monitoring of noxious or dangerous 
gases.   We are initiating research on the use of solid state 
materials for infrared detection using a method which will not require 
cooling of materials to attain high sensitivity.   The rapid 
advance in science today suggests many other avenues of investigation. 
Our plan is to keep abreast of these advances, and select for development 
those fields which seem most promising for our special capabilities. 

#NEW PLANT FACILITIES#

Early in August we broke ground 
for a new $3,500,000 plant in Warwick, Rhode Island, which will house 
our textile and coil winding machinery operations. Construction is 
well along, and the plant is scheduled for completion in November of 
this year. All operations now carried on at our plant at Cranston will 
be transferred to Warwick. Operations in the new plant should be 
producing efficiently early in 1962.   An architect's sketch 
of the new plant is shown on the front cover. The building will contain 
430,000 square feet, approximately the same as our present plant. However, 
its modern one-story layout is designed to increase our production 
capacity, permit more efficient manufacturing, and substantially 
reduce current repair and maintenance costs.   A major consideration 
in the choice of the Warwick site, four miles from Cranston, was 
the fact that it permits retention of our present trained and highly 
skilled work force.   We have entered into an agreement for the 
sale of the present Cranston properties, effective as soon as we have
