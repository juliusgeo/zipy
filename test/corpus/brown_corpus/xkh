#TECHNICAL 
ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY#

The Small Business Administration 
(~SBA) provides guidance and advice on sources of technical 
information relating to small business management and research 
and development of products. _SMALL BUSINESS MANAGEMENT_ Practical 
management problems and their suggested solutions are dealt with in 
a series of ~SBA publications. These publications, written especially 
for the managers or owners of small businesses, indirectly aid in 
community development programs. They are written by specialists in 
numerous types of business enterprises, cover a wide range of subjects, 
and are directed to the needs and interests of the small firm.

~SBA offers Administrative Management Courses, which are designed 
to improve the management efficiency and "know-how" of small 
business concerns within a community. ~SBA cosponsors these courses 
with educational institutions and community groups.   Through 
the ~SBA's Management Counseling Program, practical, personalized 
advice on sound management principles is available upon request 
to both prospective and established businessmen in a community. One-day 
conferences covering some specific phase of business management, 
also part of the continuing activities of the Small Business Administration, 
aid community economic development programs. These short, "streamlined" 
meetings usually are sponsored by local banks, Chambers 
of Commerce, trade associations, or other civic organizations. _PRODUCT 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_ Production specialists in ~SBA 
regional offices are available to help individual small business concerns 
with technical production problems. Guidance and advice are available 
on new product research and development; new product potential; 
processing methods; product and market developments; new industrial 
uses for raw, semi-processed and waste, materials; and industrial 
uses 
for agricultural products.   ~SBA serves also as a clearing 
house for information on products and processes particularly adaptable 
for exploitation by small firms. This may be helpful in improving the 
competitive position of established firms through diversification and 
expansion or through more economical utilization of plant capacity. 
_PRODUCTION ASSISTANCE_ Production specialists are available in 
~SBA regional offices to help individual small business concerns 
with technical production problems. These problems frequently arise 
where a firm is making items for the Government not directly along the 
lines of its normal civilian business or where the Government specifications 
require operations that the firm did not understand when it 
undertook the contract. Production assistance often takes the form of 
locating tools or materials which are urgently needed. Advice is given 
also on problems of plant location and plant space. _PROPERTY SALES 
ASSISTANCE_ The property sales assistance program is designed to 
assist small business concerns that may wish to buy property offered 
for sale by the Federal Government. Under this program, property sales 
specialists in the Small Business Administration regional offices 
help small business concerns to locate Federal property for sale and 
insure that small firms have the opportunity to bid competitively for 
surplus personal and real property and certain natural resources, including 
timber from the national forests.   ~SBA works closely 
with the principal property disposal installations of the Federal 
Government in reviewing proposed sales programs and identifying those 
types of property that small business concerns are most likely to be 
interested in purchasing. Proposed property sales of general interest 
to small business concerns are publicized through ~SBA regional 
news releases, and by "flyers" directed to the small business concerns. 
Each ~SBA regional office also maintains a "want" list 
of surplus property, principally machinery and equipment, desired by 
small business concerns in its area. When suitable equipment is located 
by the ~SBA representative, the small business concern is contacted 
and advised on when, where, and how to bid on such property. 
_FACILITIES INVENTORY_ Section 8 (~b) (2) of the Small Business 
Act, as amended, authorizes the ~SBA to make a complete inventory 
of the productive facilities of small business concerns. The Administration 
maintains a productive facilities inventory of small business 
industrial concerns that have voluntarily registered. It is kept 
in each Regional office for the small firms within the region. Purpose 
of this inventory is to include all eligible productive facilities 
in ~SBA's facilities register so that the small business concerns 
may have an opportunity to avail themselves of the services authorized 
by the Congress in establishing the Small Business Administration. 
These services include procurement and technical assistance and 
notice of surplus sales and invitations to bid on Government contracts 
for products and services within the registrants' field of operations. 
~SBA can make complete facilities inventories of all small business 
concerns in labor surplus areas within budgetary and staff limitations.

#LOANS#

_TO SMALL BUSINESS_ 
~SBA makes loans to individual small business firms, providing 
them with financing when it is not otherwise available through private 
lending sources on reasonable terms. Many such loans have been made 
to establish small concerns or to aid in their growth, thereby contributing 
substantially to community development programs. _LOAN POLICIES._ 
~SBA loans, which may be made to small manufacturers, small 
business pools, wholesalers, retailers, service establishments and 
other small businesses (when financing is not otherwise available to them 
on reasonable terms), are to finance business construction, conversion, 
or expansion; the purchase of equipment, facilities, machinery, 
supplies, or materials; or to supply working capital. Evidence that 
other sources of financing are unavailable must be provided. _TYPES 
OF LOANS._ ~SBA business loans are of two types: "participation" 
and "direct". Participation loans are those made jointly 
by the ~SBA and banks or other private lending institutions. Direct 
loans are those made by ~SBA alone. To qualify for either 
type of loan, an applicant must be a small business or approved small 
business "pool" and must meet certain credit requirements. A small 
business is defined as one which is independently owned and operated 
and which is not dominant in its field. In addition, the ~SBA 
uses such criteria as number of employees and dollar volume of the business. 
_CREDIT REQUIREMENTS._ The credit requirements stipulate that 
the applicant must have the ability to operate the business successfully 
and have enough capital in the business so that, with loan assistance 
from the ~SBA, it will be able to operate on a sound financial 
basis. A proposed loan must be for sound purposes or sufficiently 
secured so as to assure a reasonable chance of repayment. The record 
of past earnings and prospects for the future must indicate it has the 
ability to repay the loan out of current and anticipated income. _LOAN 
AMOUNT._ The amount which may be borrowed from the ~SBA 
depends on how much is required to carry out the intended purpose of the 
loan. The maximum loan which ~SBA may make to any one borrower 
is $350,000. Business loans generally are repayable in regular installments- 
usually monthly, including interest at the rate of 5-1/2 percent 
per annum on the unpaid balance- and have a maximum maturity 
of 10 years; the term of loans for working capital is 6 years. _CONTACT_

The Farm Credit Administration, an independent agency 
located within the Department of Agriculture, supervises and coordinates 
a cooperative credit system for agriculture. The system is composed 
of three credit services, Federal Land Banks and National Farm 
Loan Associations, Federal Intermediate (short-term) Credit Banks, 
and Banks for Cooperatives. This system provides long- and short-term 
credit to farmers and their cooperative marketing, purchasing, 
and business service organizations.   As a source of investment 
capital, the system is beneficial to local communities and encourages 
the development of industries in rural areas. The credit provdied 
by the first two services in the system outlined above is primarily for 
general agricultural purposes. The third credit service, Banks for 
Cooperatives, exists under authority of the Farm Credit Act of 1933. 
The Banks for Cooperatives were established to provide a permanent 
source of credit on a sound basis for farmers' cooperatives. _TYPES 
OF LOANS._ Three distinct classes of loans are made available 
to farmers' cooperatives by the Banks for Cooperatives: Commodity 
loans, operating capital loans, and facility loans. _ELIGIBILITY._ 
To be eligible to borrow from a Bank for Cooperatives, a cooperative 
must be an association in which farmers act together in processing 
and marketing farm products, purchasing farm supplies, or furnishing 
farm business services, and must meet the requirements set forth 
in the Farm Credit Act of 1933, as amended. _INTEREST RATES._ 
Interest rates are determined by the board of directors of the bank with 
the approval of the Farm Credit Administration. _CONTACT_ For 
further information, contact the Bank for Cooperatives serving the 
region, or the Farm Credit Administration, Research and Information 
Division, Washington 25, D&C&. _PRINTED MATERIAL_ Available, 
on request, from U&S& Department of Agriculture, Washington 
25, D&C&, are: <Cooperative Farm Credit Can Assist 
in Rural Development> (Circular No& 44), and <The Cooperative 
Farm Credit System> (Circular No& 36-~A).
