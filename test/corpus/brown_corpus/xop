a time peering at the unlovely hills, his gaze continually returning to 
Papa-san. He had come here in order to test himself. While most of 
his beliefs were still unsettled, he knew that he did not believe in 
killing. Yet, he was here. He had come because he could not live out 
his life feeling that he had been a coward. ##

There were ten men 
on the patrol which Sergeant Prevot led out that next night. The 
beaming ~ROK was carrying a thirty-caliber machine gun; another 
man lugged the tripod and a box of ammunition. Warren and White each 
carried, in addition to their own weapons and ammo, a box of ammo for 
the ~ROK's machine gun. Others carried extra clips for the 
Browning Automatic Rifle, which was in the hands of a little Mexican 
named Martinez. Prevot had briefed the two new men that afternoon. 
"We just sit quiet and wait", Prevot had said. "Be sure the 
man nearest you is awake. If Joe doesn't show up, we'll all be 
back here at 0600 hours. Otherwise, we hold a reception. Then we pull 
out under our mortar and artillery cover, but nobody pulls out until 
I say so. Remember what I said about going out to get anybody left 
behind? That still holds. We bring back all dead and wounded".

At 2130 hours they had passed through the barbed wire at the 
point of departure. Then began the journey through their own mine fields. 
Mines. Ours were kinder than theirs, some said. They set bouncing 
betties to jump and explode at testicle level while we more mercifully 
had them go off at the head. Mines. Big ones and little. The crude 
wooden boxes of the enemy, our nicely turned gray metal disks. But 
theirs defied the detectors. Mines. A foot misplaced, a leg missing. 
Mines. All sizes: big ones, some wired to set off a whole field, 
little ones, hand grenade size. Booby traps to fill the head with 
chunks of metal. Warren tried to shake off the jumble of his fears by 
looking at the sky. It was dark. Prevot had said that the searchlights 
would be bounced off the clouds at 2230 hours, "which gives us time 
to get settled in position".   Because they were new men and 
to be sure that they didn't get lost, Prevot had placed Warren 
and White in the center of the patrol as it filed out. His eyes now 
fixed on White's solid figure, Warren could hear behind him the tread 
of another. He could also hear the stream which he had seen from 
his position. They were going to follow it for part of their journey. 
"It's safe", Prevot had said, "and it provides cover for our 
noise".   Soon they were picking their way along the edge of 
the stream which glowed in the night. On their right rose the embankment 
covered with brush and trees. If a branch extended out too far, 
each man held it back for the next, and if they met a low overhang, each 
warned the other. Thus, stealthily they advanced upstream; then 
they turned to the right, climbed the embankment, and walked into the 
valley again. There was no cover here, only grass sighing against 
pant-legs. And with each sigh, like a whip in the hand of an expert, 
the grass stripped something from Warren. The gentle whir of each footstep 
left him more naked than before, until he felt his unprotected 
flesh tremble, chilled by each new sound. The shapes of the men ahead 
of him lacked solidity, as if the whip had stripped them of their very 
flesh. The dark forms moved like mourners on some nocturnal pilgrimage, 
their dirge unsung for want of vocal chords. The warped, broken 
trees in the valley assumed wraith-like shapes. Clumps of brush that 
they passed were so many enchained demons straining 
in anger to tear and gnaw on his bones. Looming over all, Papa-san 
leered down at him, threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies. Off in 
the distance a searchlight flashed on, its beam slashing the sky. The 
sharp ray was absorbed by a cloud, then reflected to the earth in a 
softer, diffused radiance. Somewhere over there another patrol had need 
of light. Warren thought of all the men out that night who, like 
himself, had left their protective ridge and- fear working at their 
guts- picked their way into the area beyond. From the east to the west 
coast of the Korean peninsula was a strip of land in which fear-filled 
men were at that same moment furtively crawling through the night, 
sitting in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound, or shouting 
amidst confused rifle flashes and muzzle blasts. White's arm went 
up and Warren raised his own. The patrol was stopping.   Prevot 
came up "Take that spot over there", he whispered, pointing to 
a small clump of blackness. "Give me your machine gun ammo". Warren 
handed him the metal box and Prevot quietly disappeared down the 
line.   Lying in the grass behind the brush clump, Warren looked 
about. The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass and 
the brush. Over his shoulder he could see Prevot with the machine gun 
crew. Even at this short distance they were only vague shapes, setting 
up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the 
heads of the rest of the patrol.   Warren eased his rifle's 
safety off and gently, slowly sneaked another clip of ammunition from 
one of the cloth bandoleers that marked the upper part of his body with 
an ~X. This he placed within quick reach. The walk and his fears 
had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits cooled at the touch 
of the night air. Although the armored vest fitted the upper part 
of his body snugly, he felt no security. Figures seemed to crouch in 
the surrounding dark; in the distance he saw a band of men who seemed 
to advance and retreat even as he watched. Certain this menace was 
only imaginary, he yet stared in fascinated horror, his hand sticky against 
the stock of his weapon. He was aware of insistent inner beatings, 
as if prisoners within sought release from his rigid body. 
Above, the glowing ivory baton of their searchlight pointed at the clouds, 
diluting the valley's dark to a pallid light. Then the figures 
which held his attention became a group of shattered trees, standing 
like the grotesques of a medieval damnation scene. Even so, he could 
not ease the tension of his body; the rough surface of the earth itself 
seemed to resist every attempt on his part to relax. Sensing the 
unseen presence of the other men in the patrol, he felt mutely united 
to these nine near-strangers sharing this pinpoint of being with him. 
He sensed something precious in the perilous moment, something akin 
to the knowledge gained on his bicycle trip through the French countryside, 
a knowledge imprisoned in speechlessness.  - In France 
he had puzzled the meaning of the great stone monuments men had thrown 
up to the sky, and always as he wandered, he felt a stranger to their 
exultation. They were poems in a strange language, of which he could 
barely touch a meaning- enough to make his being ache with the desire 
for the fullness he sensed there. Brittany, that stone-gray mystery 
through which he traveled for thirty days, sleeping in the barns of 
farmers or alongside roads, had worked some subtle change in him, he 
knew, and it was in Brittany that he had met Pierre.   Pierre 
had no hands; they had been severed at the wrists. With leather cups 
fitted in his handlebars, he steered his bicycle. He and Warren had 
traveled together for four days. They visited the shipyards at Brest 
and Pierre had to sign the register, vouching for the integrity of 
the visiting foreigner. He took the pen in his stumps and began to 
write.   "Wait! Wait"! cried the guard who ran from the 
hut to shout to other men standing about outside. They crowded the small 
room and peered over one another's shoulders to watch the handless 
man write his name in the book.   "C'est formidable", 
they exclaimed.   "Mais, oui. C'est merveilleux". 
And then the questions came, eager, interested questions, and many compliments 
on his having overcome his infirmity.   "Doesn't it 
ever bother you", Warren had asked, "to have people always asking 
you about your hands"?   "Oh, the French are a very curious 
people", Pierre had laughed. "They are also honest seekers 
after truth. Now the English are painfully silent about my missing 
hands. They refuse to mention or to notice that they are not there. The 
Americans, like yourself, take the fact for granted, try to be helpful, 
but don't ask questions. I'm used to all three, but I think 
the French have the healthiest attitude".   That was the day 
that Pierre had told Warren about the Abbey of Solesmes. "You 
are looking tired and there you can rest. It will be good for you. 
I think, too", he said, his dark eyes mischievous, "that you will 
find there some clue to the secret of the cathedrals about which you 
have spoken".   Within two weeks Warren was ringing the bell 
at the abbey gate. The monk who opened the door immediately calmed his 
worries about his reception: "I speak English", the old man 
said, "but I do not hear it very well". He smiled and stuck a large 
finger with white hairs sprouting on it into his ear as though that 
might help. Smiling at Warren's protestations, the old monk took 
his grip from him and led him down a corridor to a small parlor. "Will 
you please wait in here. 
MICKIE SAT over his second whisky-on-the-rocks in a little bar next 
to the funeral parlor on Pennsylvania Avenue. Al's Little Cafe 
was small, dark, narrow, and filled with the mingled scent of beer, 
tobacco smoke, and Italian cooking. Hanging over the bar was an oil 
painting of a nude Al had accepted from a student at the Corcoran 
Gallery who needed to eat and drink and was broke. The nude was small 
and black-haired and elfin, and was called "Eloise".   This 
was one place where Moonan could go for a drink in a back booth without 
anyone noticing him, or at least coming up and hanging around and 
wanting to know all the low-down. The other patrons were taxi drivers 
and art students and small shopkeepers. The reporters had not yet 
discovered that this was his hideaway.   His friend Jane was with 
him. She was wise enough to realize a man could be good company even 
if he did weigh too much and didn't own the mint. She was the widow 
of a writer who had died in an airplane crash, and Mickie had found 
her a job as head of the historical section of the Treasury. This 
meant sorting out press clippings and the like.   Jane sat receptive 
and interested. Mickie had a pleasant glow as he said, "You see, 
both of them, I mean the President and Jeff Lawrence, are romantics. 
A romantic is one who thinks the world is divinely inspired and 
all he has to do is find the right key, and then divine justice and 
altruism will appear. It's like focusing a camera; the distant ship 
isn't there until you get the focus. You know what I'm talking 
about. I'm sure all girls feel this way about men until they live 
with them.   "But when it comes to war, the Colonel knows what 
it is and Jeff doesn't. Mr& Christiansen knows that a soldier 
will get the Distinguished Service Medal for conduct that would land 
him in prison for life or the electric chair as a civilian. He had 
a mean, unbroken sheer bastard in his outfit, and someone invented the 
name Trig for him. That's to say, he was trigger happy. He'd 
shoot at anything if it was the rear end of a horse or his own sentry. 
He was a wiry, inscrutable, silent country boy from the red clay of 
rural Alabama, and he spoke with the broad drawl that others normally 
make fun of. But not in front of Trig. I heard of some that tried 
it back in the States, and he'd knock them clear across the room. 
There'd been a pretty bad incident back at the Marine base. A New 
York kid, a refugee from one of the Harlem gangs, made fun of Trig's 
accent, and drew a knife. Before the fight was over, the Harlem 
boy had a concussion and Trig was cut up badly. They caught Trig 
stealing liquor from the officers' mess, and he got a couple of girls 
in trouble. The fear of punishment just didn't bother him. It wasn't 
there. It was left out of him at birth. This is why he made such 
a magnificent soldier. He wasn't troubled with the ordinary, rank-and-file 
fear that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers 
and whole companies under fire running in panic. It just didn't 
occur to Trig that anything serious would happen to him. Do you get 
the picture of the kind of fellow he was"?   Jane nodded 
with a pleasant smile.   "All right. There was a sniper's nest 
in a mountain cave, and it was picking off our men with devilish accuracy. 
The Colonel ordered that it be wiped out, and I suggested, 
'You ask for volunteers, and promise each man on the patrol a quart 
of whisky, ten dollars and a week-end pass to Davao'. Trig was 
one of the five volunteers. The patrol snaked around in back of the cave, 
approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls. 
You could hear them from our outpost. There was a lot of shooting. 
We knew the enemy was subdued, because a flare was fired as the signal. 
So we hurried over. Two of our men were killed, a third was wounded. 
Trig and a very black colored boy from Detroit had killed or put 
out of action ten guerrillas by grenades and hand-to-hand fighting. When 
we got there, Trig and the Negro were quarreling over possession
