
The heat intensified on Tuesday. Southern California gasped 
and blinked under an autumn hot spell, drier, more enervating, more 
laden with man's contrived impurities than the worst days of the summer 
past. It could continue this way, hitting 106 and more in the Valley, 
Joe McFeeley knew, into October. He and Irvin Moll were sipping 
coffee at the breakfast bar. Both had been up since 7:00- 
Irv 
on the early-morning watch, McFeeley unable to sleep during his four-hour 
relief. The night before, they had telephoned the Andrus maid, 
Selena Masters, and she had arrived early, bursting her vigorous 
presence into the silent house with an assurance that amused McFeeley 
and confounded Moll. The latter, thanking her for the coffee, had 
winked and muttered, "Sure 'nuff, honey". Selena was the wrong 
woman for these crudities. With a hard eye, she informed Moll: "Don't 
<sure 'nuff> me, officer. I'm <honey> only to my husband, 
understand"? Sergeant Moll understood. The maid was very 
black and very energetic, trim in a yellow pique uniform. Her speech 
was barren of southernisms; she was one of Eliot Sparling's neutralized 
minorities, adopting the rolling ~<R's> and constricted 
vowels of Los Angeles. Not seeing her dark intelligent face, one 
would have gauged the voice as that of a Westwood Village matron, ten 
years out of Iowa. After she had served the detectives coffee and 
toast (they politely declined eggs, uncomfortable about their tenancy), 
she settled down with a morning newspaper and began reading the stock 
market quotations. While she was thus engaged, McFeeley questioned 
her about her whereabouts the previous day, any recollections she 
had of people hanging around, of overcurious delivery boys or repairmen, 
of strange cars cruising the neighborhood. She answered him precisely, 
missing not a beat in her scrutiny of the financial reports. Selena 
Masters, Joe realized, was her own woman. She was the only kind 
of Negro Laura Andrus would want around: independent, unservile, 
probably charging double what ordinary maids did for housework- and 
doubly efficient.   When the parents emerged from the bedroom 
a few minutes later, the maid greeted them quietly. "I'm awful sorry 
about what's happened", Selena said. "Maybe today'll be 
a good-news day". She charged off to the bedrooms.   Moll 
took his coffee 
into the nursery. During the night, a phone company technician 
had deadened the bells and installed red blinkers on the phones. Someone 
would have to remain in the office continually. McFeeley greeted 
the parents, then studied his notebook. He wanted to take the mother 
to headquarters at once and start her on the mug file.   "Sleep 
well"? he asked.   Andrus did not answer him. His face was 
bloated with drugging, redder than normal. The woman had the glassy 
look of an invalid, as if she had not slept at all. "Oh- we managed", 
she said. "I'm a little groggy. Did anything happen during 
the night"?   "Few crank calls", McFeeley said. "A 
couple of tips we're running down- nothing promising. We can 
expect more of the same. Too bad your number is in the directory".

"Didn't occur to me my child would be kidnaped when I had 
it listed", Andrus muttered. He settled on the sofa with his coffee, 
warming his hands on the cup, although the room was heavy with heat.

The three had little to say to each other. The previous night's 
horror- the absolute failure, overcast with the intrusions of 
the press, had left them all with a wan sense of uselessness, of play-acting. 
Sipping their coffee, discussing the weather, the day's shopping, 
Fritzie's commitments at the network (all of which he would 
cancel), they avoided the radio, the morning ~TV news show, even 
the front page of the <Santa Luisa Register>, resting on the kitchen 
bar. KIDNAPER SPURNS RANSOM; AMY STILL MISSING. Once, 
Andrus walked by it, hastily scanned the bold black headline and 
the five-column lead of the article (by Duane Bosch, staff correspondent- 
age not given), and muttered: "We a buncha national celebrities".

McFeeley told the parents he would escort them to 
police headquarters in a half hour. Before that, he wanted to talk to 
the neighbors. He did not want to bring the Andruses to the station 
house too early- Rheinholdt had summoned a press conference, and he 
didn't want them subjected to the reporters again. He could think 
of nothing else to tell them: no assurances, no hopeful hints at great 
discoveries that day. When the detective left, Andrus phoned his 
secretary to cancel his work and to advise the network to get a substitute 
director for his current project. Mrs& Andrus was talking to 
the 
maid, arranging for her to come in every day, instead of the four days 
she now worked.   Outside, only a handful of reporters remained. 
The bulk of the press corps was covering Rheinholdt's conference. 
In contrast to the caravan of the previous night, there were only 
four cars parked across the street. Two men he did not recognize were 
sipping coffee and munching sweet rolls. He did not see Sparling, or 
DeGroot, or Ringel, or any of the feverish crew that had so harassed 
him twelve hours ago. However, the litter remained, augmented by 
several dozen lunchroom suppers. The street cleaner had not yet been 
around.   One of the reporters called to him: "Anything new, 
Lieutenant"? And he ignored him, skirting the parked cars and 
walking up the path to the Skopas house. When McFeeley was halfway 
to the door, the proprietor emerged- a mountainous, dark man, his 
head thick with resiny black hair, his eyes like two of the black olives 
he imported in boatloads. McFeeley identified himself. The master 
of the house, his nourished face unrevealing, consented to postpone 
his departure a few minutes to talk to the detective.   Inside, 
as soon as Mr& Skopas had disclosed- in a hoarse whisper- the 
detective's errand, his family gathered in a huddle, forming a mass 
of dark flesh on and around a brocaded sofa which stood at one side of 
a baroque fireplace. Flanked by marble urns and alabaster lamps, they 
seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait.   It was amazing how 
they had herded together for protection: an enormous matriarch in 
a quilted silk wrapper, rising from the breakfast table; a gross boy 
in his teens, shuffling in from the kitchen with a sandwich in his hands; 
a girl in her twenties, fat and sullen, descending the marble 
staircase; 
then all four gathering on the sofa to face the inquisitor.

They answered him in monosyllables, nods, occasionally muttering 
in Greek to one another, awaiting the word from Papa, who restlessly 
cracked his knuckles, anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac 
and burst off to the freeway. No, they hadn't seen anyone around; 
no, they didn't know the Andrus family; yes, they had read 
about the case; yes, they had let some reporters use their phone, 
but they would no longer. They offered no opinions, volunteered nothing, 
betrayed no emotions. Studying them, McFeeley could not help make 
comparison with the Andrus couple. The Skopas people seemed to him 
of that breed of human beings whose insularity frees them from tragedy. 
He imagined they were the kind whose tax returns were never examined 
(if they were, they were never penalized), whose children had no 
unhappy romances, whose names never knew scandal. The equation was 
simple: 
wealth brought them happiness, and their united front to the world 
was their warning that they meant to keep everything they had, let 
no one in on the secrets. By comparison, Fritzie and Laura Andrus 
were quivering fledglings. They possessed no outer fortifications, no 
hard shells of confidence; they had enough difficulty getting from 
day to day, let alone having an awful crime thrust upon them. Skopas 
expressed no curiosity over the case, offered no expression of sympathy, 
made no move to escort McFeeley to the door. All four remained 
impacted on the sofa until he had left.   He had spoken to Mrs& 
Emerson the previous day. There remained a family named Kahler, 
owners of a two-story Tudor-style house on the south side of the Andrus 
home. Their names had not come up in any discussions with Laura, 
and he had no idea what they would be like. McFeeley noted the immaculate 
lawn and gardens: each blade of grass cropped, bright and firm; 
each shrub glazed with good health.   The door was answered 
by a slender man in his sixties- straight-backed, somewhat clerical 
in manner, wearing rimless glasses. When Joe identified himself, he 
nodded, unsmiling, and ushered him into a sedate living room. Mrs& 
Kahler joined them. She had a dried-out quality- a gray, lean woman, 
not unattractive. Both were dressed rather formally. The man wore 
a vest and a tie, the woman had on a dark green dress and three strands 
of pearls.   "Funny thing", Mr& Kahler said, when they 
were seated, "when I heard you ringing, I figured it was that guy 
down the block, Hausman". McFeeley looked puzzled. Kahler continued: 
"I fixed his dog the other day and I guess he's sore, 
so I expected him to come barging in". Mr& Kahler went on to explain 
how Hausman's fox terrier had been "making" in his flower 
beds. The dog refused to be scared off, so Kahler had purchased some 
small firecrackers. He would lay in wait in the garage, and when the 
terrier came scratching around, he'd let fly with a cherry bomb. "Scared 
the hell out of him", Kahler grinned. "I hit him in the 
ass once". Both grinned at the detective. "Finally, all I needed 
was to throw a little piece of red wood that looked like a firecracker 
and that dumb dog would run ki-yi-ing for his life". 
In the dim underwater light they dressed and straightened up the room, 
and then they went across the hall to the kitchen. She was intimidated 
by the stove. He found the pilot light and turned on one of the burners 
for her. The gas flamed up two inches high. They found the teakettle 
and put water on to boil and then searched through the icebox. 
Several sections of a loaf of dark bread; butter; jam; a tiny 
cake of ice. In their search for what turned out to be the right breakfast 
china but the wrong table silver, they opened every cupboard door 
in the kitchen and pantry. While she was settling the teacart, he went 
back across the hall to their bedroom, opened one of the suitcases, 
and took out powdered coffee and sugar. She appeared with the teacart 
and he opened the windows.   "Do you want to call Eugene"?

He didn't, but it was not really a question, and so he 
left the room, walked down the hall to the front of the apartment, hesitated, 
and then knocked lightly on the closed door of the study. A sleepy 
voice answered.   "Le petit dejeuner", Harold said, in 
an accent that did credit to Miss Sloan, his high-school French teacher. 
At the same time, his voice betrayed uncertainty about their 
being here, and conveyed an appeal to whatever is reasonable, peace-loving, 
and dependable in everybody.   Since ordinary breakfast-table 
conversation was impossible, it was at least something that they were 
able to offer Eugene the sugar bowl with their sugar in it, and the 
plate of bread and butter, and that Eugene could return the pitcher 
of hot milk to them handle first. Eugene put a spoonful of powdered 
coffee into his cup and then filled it with hot water. Stirring, he 
said: "I am sorry that my work prevents me from doing anything with 
you today".   They assured him that they did not expect or 
need to be entertained.   Harold put a teaspoonful of powdered coffee 
in 
his cup and filled it with hot water, and then, stirring, he sat back 
in his chair. The chair creaked. Every time he moved or said something, 
the chair creaked again.   Eugene was not entirely silent, 
or openly rude- unless asking Harold to move to another chair and 
placing himself in the fauteuil that creaked so alarmingly was an act 
of rudeness. It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight, 
and all it needed, Harold thought, was for somebody to fling himself 
back in a fit of laughter and that would be the end of it. 
Through the open window they heard sounds below in the street: cartwheels, 
a tired horse's plodding step, voices. Harold indicated the 
photograph on the wall and asked what church the stone sculpture was 
in. Eugene told him and he promptly forgot. They passed the marmalade, 
the bread, the black-market butter, back and forth. Nothing was said 
about hotels or train journeys.   Eugene offered Harold his 
car, to use at any time he cared to, and when this offer was not accepted, 
the armchair creaked. They all three had another cup of coffee.
