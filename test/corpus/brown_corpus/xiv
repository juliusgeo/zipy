with others to help these people achieve their legitimate ambitions, 
as expressed in their different multi-year plans. Through the 
World Bank and other instrumentalities, as well as through individual 
action by every nation in position to help, we must squarely face 
this titanic challenge.   I shall continue to urge the American 
people, in the interests of their own security, prosperity and peace, 
to make sure that their own part of this great project be amply and 
cheerfully supported. Free world decisions in this matter may spell the 
difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom.

Other countries, some of which I visited last month, have similar 
needs.   A common meeting ground is desirable for those nations 
which are prepared to assist in the development effort. During the 
past year I have discussed this matter with the leaders of several Western 
nations.   Because of its wealth of experience, the Organization 
for European Economic Cooperation could help with the initial 
studies needed. The goal is to enlist all available economic resources 
in the industrialized Free World, especially private investment 
capital.   By extending this help, we hope to make possible the 
enthusiastic enrollment of these nations under freedom's banner. 
No more startling contrast to a system of sullen satellites could be 
imagined.   If we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive 
partnership between the less fortunate nations and those that have 
already achieved a high state of economic advancement, we will make 
brighter the outlook for a world order based upon security and freedom. 
Otherwise, the outlook could be dark indeed. We face, indeed, what 
may be a turning point in history, and we must act decisively and wisely. 
##

As a nation we can successfully pursue these objectives 
only from a position of broadly based strength.   No matter how 
earnest is our quest for guaranteed peace, we must maintain a high degree 
of military effectiveness at the same time we are engaged in negotiating 
the issue of arms reduction. Until tangible and mutually enforceable 
arms reduction measures are worked out we will not weaken the 
means of defending our institutions.   America possesses an enormous 
defense power. It is my studied conviction that no nation will ever 
risk general war against us unless we should become so foolish as 
to neglect the defense forces we now so powerfully support. It is world-wide 
knowledge that any power which might be tempted today to attack 
the United States by surprise, even though we might sustain great 
losses, would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction. But I once 
again assure all peoples and all nations that the United States, 
except in defense, will never turn loose this destructive power.

During the past year, our long-range striking power, unmatched today 
in manned bombers, has taken on new strength as the Atlas intercontinental 
ballistic missile has entered the operational inventory. In 
fourteen recent test launchings, at ranges of five thousand miles, <Atlas> 
has been striking on an average within two miles of the target. 
This is less than the length of a jet runway- well within the circle 
of destruction. 
Incidentally, there was an <Atlas> firing last 
night. From all reports so far received, its performance conformed to 
the high standards I have just described. Such performance is a great 
tribute to American scientists and engineers, who in the past five 
years have had to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range 
ballistic missiles, where America had none before.   This 
year, moreover, growing numbers of nuclear powered submarines will 
enter our active forces, some to be armed with Polaris missiles. These 
remarkable ships and weapons, ranging the oceans, will be capable of 
accurate fire on targets virtually anywhere on earth.   To meet 
situations of less than general nuclear war, we continue to maintain 
our carrier forces, our many service units abroad, our always ready 
Army strategic forces and Marine Corps divisions, and the civilian 
components. The continuing modernization of these forces is a costly 
but necessary process. It is scheduled to go forward at a rate which 
will steadily add to our strength.   The deployment of a portion 
of these forces beyond our shores, on land and sea, is persuasive demonstration 
of our determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our 
allies for collective security. Moreover, I have directed that steps 
be taken to program on a longer range basis our military assistance to 
these allies. This is necessary for a sounder collective defense system.

Next I refer to our program in space exploration, which 
is often mistakenly supposed to be an integral part of defense research 
and development.   We note that, first, America has already 
made 
great contributions in the past two years to the world's fund of 
knowledge of astrophysics and space science. These discoveries are of 
present interest chiefly to the scientific community; but they are 
important foundation stones for more extensive exploration of outer space 
for the ultimate benefit of all mankind.   Second, our military 
missile program, going forward so successfully, does not suffer from 
our present lack of very large rocket engines, which are necessary 
in distant space exploration. I am assured by experts that the thrust 
of our present missiles is fully adequate for defense requirements.

Third, the United States is pressing forward in the development 
of large rocket engines to place vehicles of many tons into space 
for exploration purposes.   Fourth, in the meantime, it is necessary 
to remember that we have only begun to probe the environment immediately 
surrounding the earth. Using launch systems presently available, 
we are developing satellites to scout the world's weather; satellite 
relay stations to facilitate and extend communications over the 
globe; for navigation aids to give accurate bearings to ships and 
aircraft; and for perfecting instruments to collect and transmit the 
data we seek.   Fifth, we have just completed a year's experience 
with our new space law. I believe it deficient in certain particulars. 
Suggested improvements will be submitted to the Congress shortly.

The accomplishment of the many tasks I have alluded to requires 
the continuous strengthening of the spiritual, intellectual, 
and 
economic sinews of American life. The steady purpose of our society 
is to assure justice, before God, for every individual. We must be 
ever alert that freedom does not wither through the careless amassing 
of restrictive controls or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the 
issues of the day.   A year ago, when I met with you, the nation 
was emerging from an economic downturn, even though the signs of resurgent 
prosperity were not then sufficiently convincing to the doubtful. 
Today our surging strength is apparent to everyone. 1960 promises 
to be the most prosperous year in our history.   Yet we continue 
to be afflicted by nagging disorders. Among current problems that 
require solutions, participated in by citizens as well as government, 
are:   the need to protect the public interest in situations of 
prolonged labor-management stalemate;   the persistent refusal 
to come to grips with a critical problem in one sector of American agriculture;

the continuing threat of inflation, together with 
the persisting tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility;   in certain 
instances the denial to some of our citizens of equal protection 
of the law.

The group, upon the issuance of its first press release on December 
21, 1957, designated itself a "Committee of Investigation". 
In the course of its inquiry, it took testimony from only seven witnesses. 
It heard Bang-Jensen twice and his lawyer, Adolf A& Berle, 
Jr&, once.   Its second press release was on January 15, 
1958, and it recommended that the secret papers be destroyed. It also 
implied that Paul Bang-Jensen had been irresponsible.   On 
January 18, Ernest Gross conducted a press conference at the U&N& 
lasting an hour. Here, he openly attacked Bang-Jensen and referred 
to his "aberrant conduct". This conference was held despite 
Stavropoulos' assurance to Adolf Berle, who was leaving the same 
day for Puerto Rico, that nothing would be done until his return on 
January 22, except that the Secretary General would probably order 
the list destroyed.   On January 24 Paul Bang-Jensen, accompanied 
by Adolf Berle, was met by Dragoslav Protitch and Colonel 
Frank Begley, former Police Chief of Farmington, Conn&, and now 
head of U&N& special police.   The four, bundled in overcoats, 
mounted to the wind-swept roof of the U&N&   There, 
Begley lit a fire in a wire basket, and Bang-Jensen dropped four 
sealed envelopes into the flames. In one of these he said were notes 
on the identities of the eighty-one refugees.   The method of destroying 
the evidence embarrassed Paul Bang-Jensen. He knew it would 
be implied that it was done in this way at his insistence. He was 
right, and Peter Marshall could not help but recall Andrew Cordier's 
words on the subject, "Well, it seemed as good a place as any 
to do the job".   The Gross group had been formed for the express 
purpose of advising the Secretary General. Hammarskjold's supposed 
desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of Ernest Gross 
is illusion, at best. Gross's being "outside" the U&N& 
applied only to a physical state, not an objective one. But by the 
time the papers were finally disposed of, the group had informed the 
world of its purpose, its recommendations, and its belief that Paul 
Bang-Jensen was not of sound mind.   Shortly the group would issue 
its report to the Secretary General, recommending Paul Bang-Jensen's 
dismissal from the United Nations. The contents of this 
195-page document would become known to many before it would become known 
to the man it was written about. ##

"Until this Hungarian 
Committee matter came up, Bang-Jensen was a fine and devoted individual. 
I had known him for some years, when I was a delegate and before, 
and this manner had never been his".   Ernest A& Gross 
leaned back in his chair and told Peter Marshall how Secretary General 
Dag Hammarskjold had, on December 4,1957, called him in as a 
private lawyer to review Bang-Jensen's conduct "relating to his 
association with the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary". 
The result was the "Gross Report", prepared by Gross, as chairman, 
with the assistance of two U&N& Under Secretaries, Constantin 
Stavropoulos and Philippe de Seynes.   "Yes", Gross 
went on, "Bang-Jensen was an up-and-coming young man. He had 
always done well. Never well known, but he had done his work competently 
**h".   Gross had received Marshall courteously and they 
were discussing the case. "You know", the lawyer said, "it's 
difficult to talk like this about a man who can't answer back".

Gross was behind a clean-top desk, only a manila folder before 
him. Marshall sat in one of the several leather chairs. Outside the 
office windows, twenty-four stories above Wall Street, a light rain 
was falling.   "Mr& Gross, your report says that 'our 
function is investigative and advisory and does not in any way derogate 
from or prejudice Mr& Bang-Jensen's rights as a staff member'. 
You know, Bang-Jensen characterized your Committee as having prejudged 
his case".   Gross swung his swivel chair. "Well, 
how could that have been? I don't consider that he was prejudged. 
We were given a job and we carried it out, and later, his case was taken 
up by the Disciplinary Committee **h.   "We have nothing 
to hide under a bushel. We did our job, Mr& Stavropoulos and Mr& 
de Seynes and myself, taking evidence from a number of people".

"What did you think about his mental state"?   "I 
think our report sums up our finding", Gross answered. "Don't 
forget, here was a man who had been accusing his colleagues for almost 
a year of willfully attempting to present an incorrect report **h.

"This was not merely alleging errors, but was carried out
