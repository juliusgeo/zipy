real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water 
land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater 
land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment. 
In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the developers 
of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours. 
In this instance, happily, insistence is being made that our share 
is protected. And until this protection is at least as concrete as, 
say, the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach, 
those who represent us all should agree to nothing. 

#CLOSED DOORS IN CITY HALL# 

The reaction of certain City Council members to 
California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.

We had assumed that at least this local legislative 
body had nothing to hide, and, therefore, had no objections to making 
the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available 
to the public.   In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes, 
collectively known as the Brown Act, the Legislature declares that 
"the public commissions, boards and councils and other public agencies 
in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. 
It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and 
that their deliberations be conducted openly.   "The people 
of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve 
them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public 
servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and 
what is not good for them to know.   The full implementation of 
these noble words, however, has taken the efforts of five sessions of 
the Legislature. Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting 
guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted, but not 
until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining 
loopholes in the Brown Act.   Despite the lip service paid by 
local governments, the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted 
by reservations and rationalizations. When all else fails, it 
is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations.

We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law- and one 
of its principal aims. Without public scrutiny the deliberations 
of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily. But the 
citizens would, of course, never be sure that the decisions that resulted 
were as correct as they were expeditious. 

#HELP WHEN NEEDED#

@ IF THE Dominican Republic achieves 
free, democratic government, it will be due in large part to the U&S& 
show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened 
restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.   Outwardly, Ciudad 
Trujillo is calm. None of the Trujillo family remains. Mr& 
Balaguer is in control, and opposition leaders have no further excuse 
to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections 
in the spring.   Had U&S& warships not appeared off 
the Dominican coast, there is every possibility that the country would 
now be wracked by civil war. Ultimately either the Trujillos would 
have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions 
favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro 
in Cuba.   Within the Organization of American States, 
there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention 
which was not without risk obviously. But there was no complaint from 
the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront 
shouting, "Vive Yankees"! More, the U&S& action was hailed 
by a principal opposition leader, Dr& Juan Bosch, as having saved 
"many lives and many troubles in the near future".   Mr& 
Balaguer's troubles are by no means over. He will need the help 
of all ~OAS members to eradicate, finally, the forces of authoritarianism, 
pro-Trujillo and pro-Castro alike. In cooperating toward 
that objective, ~OAS might move with the speed and effectiveness 
demonstrated by the United States. @ 

#MATTER OF SURVIVAL#

@ 
THOSE watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial 
unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor 
split in 1935.   Now, as then, it is a matter of jobs. Craft 
unions seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory maintenance.

The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession 
from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union 
members. That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American 
Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. 
Or that's what it looked like at the time.   But automation 
and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition 
for jobs. Walter Reuther, leader of the industrial union faction 
of the ~AFL-~CIO, says another two years of this squabbling 
will be disastrous for all American labor.   Whether it could 
be as disastrous for American labor as, say, Jimmy Hoffa of the 
Teamsters, is a matter of conjecture. But the jurisdictional disputes 
that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for 
labor.   Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition 
of national survival, this country can have little patience with 
labor's family feuds. The concept of labor as a special class is 
outmoded, and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free 
world, labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself 
to survive. @ 

#DETERRENT#

@ THE Army, Navy and Air 
Force, among others, may question Secretary Freeman's claim that 
the high estate of United States agriculture is the "strongest 
deterrent" to the spread of communism. But the secretary insists that 
the success of the American farmer is the "greatest single source 
of strength" in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.

Mr& Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on 
a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity 
to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production- or 
even by the Soviet's successes in space. This shouldn't surprise 
the secretary; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses 
for a long, long time.   In fact, over the years, the American 
farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large 
dollar. And thus far, Mr& Freeman has offered very little relief.

The 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary sponsored, 
has been declared a billion dollar fiasco. In exchange for higher price 
supports, growers pledged reduction in planted acreage. But the 
farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the 
rows and pouring on the fertilizer.   The result: $1.1 billion 
added to the deficit in the federal budget. Perhaps, as Mr& Freeman 
says, American agriculture may stop the Communists, but it is also 
swindling the American taxpayer. @ 

#WHAT'S WRONG AT STATE# 
@ A SENATE subcommittee headed by Sen& Jackson of Washington 
has been going over the State Department and has reached some 
predictable conclusions. The department needs a clearer "sense of 
direction" at the top and it needs fewer, but better, people, Sen& 
Jackson says.   The subcommittee is not alone in questioning 
the effectiveness of the department. President Kennedy has indicated 
his dissatisfaction with its performance.   But those who would 
revitalize so complex an organization must, first of all, overcome the 
resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures, 
suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.   Nor does Sen& 
Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in 
the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the 
study of foreign policy. This tends to create friction and confusion 
and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and 
initiative among his subordinates.   But competent observers believe 
he is making progress, particularly toward what Sen& Jackson 
lists as the primary need- "a clearer understanding of where our 
vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them".

The Jackson report will provide some of the political support 
Mr& Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel 
engaged, as Sen& Jackson puts it, "in work that does not really 
need doing". Mr& Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen& Jackson's 
recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national 
security problems be improved. Self-criticism is a rare but needed 
commodity in Congress. @ 

#BETTING MEN#

@ FORECASTING 
economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist. 
But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he 
be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment 
trends.   James P& Mitchell, when he was the head of the department, 
promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below 
three million a couple of years ago. He lost, but settled for a cake 
in the shape of a fedora.   His successor, Secretary Goldberg, 
also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which 
has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months. No 
betting man, Mr& Goldberg says he's merely "putting my neck out 
again" by predicting the rate will go down this month. He is basing 
his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened 
its stride- a new record high in personal income, an increase 
in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for 
durable goods.   Mr& Mitchell had an excuse for losing- the 
steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. Mr& Goldberg 
has less reason for missing. The economy seems to be sailing along on 
an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an 
end so they can't be blamed in November. The odds thus appear favorable 
that the secretary's neck may be spared. @ 

#LITTLE RESISTANCE# 
@ CAMBODIA'S chief of state, who has been accused of 
harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for 
neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand, insists he would be very 
unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia.

But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince 
Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel. "I have to see the 
facts", is the way the prince puts it. And from that point of vantage 
he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-Western 
posture.   Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication 
some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the 
courage of his convictions. 

#BOTTOM SIGHTED#

@ COMMERCE Secretary Hodges seems to have 
been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic 
forecasters. Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second 
quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking 
their heads in disagreement. Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and 
Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr& Hodges' appraisal, 
though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White 
House.   And now Mr& Hodges has pioneered further into the
