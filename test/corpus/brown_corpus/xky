
MR& JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.

This is a prosecution for refusal to be inducted into the 
armed services, in violation of the provisions of the Universal Military 
Training and Service Act, 62 Stat& 604, 622, 50 U&S&C& 
App& @ 462 (a). Petitioner, who claims to be a conscientious 
objector, contends that he was denied due process, both in the proceedings 
before a hearing officer of the Department of Justice and at 
trial. He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing 
officer statements attributed to him by the local board, and, further, 
that he was denied at trial the right to have the Department of Justice 
hearing officer's report and the original report of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation as to his claim- all in violation of the 
Fifth Amendment. The trial judge decided that the administrative procedures 
of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require 
the production of such documents. Petitioner was found guilty and sentenced 
to 15 months' imprisonment. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 
269 F& 2d 613. We granted certiorari in view of the importance of 
the questions in the administration of the Act. 361 U& S& 899. 
We have concluded that petitioner's claims are controlled by the rationale 
of <gonzales> v& <United States>, 348 U&S& 407 
(1955), 
and <United States> v& <Nugent>, 346 U&S& 1 (1953), 
and therefore affirm the judgment.   Petitioner registered with 
Local Board No& 9, Boulder, Colorado, on March 17, 1952. His 
answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a 
minister of Jehovah's Witnesses, employed at night by a sugar producer. 
He claimed /4,-~D classification as a minister of religion, 
devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching. On November 
13, 1952, he was classified in Class /1,-~A. On November 22, 
1952, he wrote the Board, protesting this classification. He again stated 
that he was "a regular minister"; that he was "devoting 
an average 
of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly", in addition to 
50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties, and that he opposed war in 
any form. Thereafter he was classified /1,-~O. On April 1, 1953, 
after some six months of full-time "pioneering", petitioner discontinued 
devoting 100 hours a month to preaching, but failed to so 
notify his local board. In a periodic review, the local board on July 
30, 1953, reclassified him /1,-~A and upheld this classification 
after a personal appearance by petitioner, because of his willingness 
to kill in defense of his church and home. Upon administrative approval 
of the reclassification, he was ordered to report for induction on 
June 11, 1956, but failed to do so. He was not prosecuted, however, 
and his case was subsequently reopened, in the light of <Sicurella> 
v& <United States>, 348 U&S& 385 (1955). He was again 
reclassified /1,-~A by the local board. There followed a customary 
Department of Justice hearing, at which petitioner appeared. In 
his report to the Attorney General, the hearing officer suggested that 
the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service. 
On March 21, 1957, however, the Department recommended approval of 
the /1,-~A classification. Its ground for this recommendation was 
that, while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17, 1956 
(as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date), that he 
was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching, the headquarters 
of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so 
and, on the contrary, had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible 
Student Servant positions. It reported that he now devoted only some 
6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per 
month to church activities. His claim was therefore "so highly exaggerated", 
the Department concluded, that it "cast doubt upon his 
veracity and, consequently, upon his sincerity and good faith". The 
appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation. In 
his answer thereto, he advised the Board that he had made no such statement 
in 1956, and asserted that his only claim to "pioneering" 
was in 1952. The appeal board, however, unanimously concurred in the 
Department's recommendation. Upon return of the file to the local 
board, petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this 
prosecution followed his failure to do so.   Petitioner first contends 
that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving 
him timely opportunity, before its final recommendation to the appeal 
board, to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim 
of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching. But the statement of the 
local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file. He 
admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times, and he could have 
rebutted it before the hearing officer. This he failed to do, asserting 
that he did not know it to be in his file. Apparently he never 
took the trouble to find out. Nevertheless he had ample opportunity 
to contest the statement before the appeal board. After the recommendation 
of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board, that is the 
appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial. This he did. 
We found in <Gonzales> v& <United States, supra>, that this 
was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be 
furnished a registrant. We said there that it was necessary "that 
a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut [the Department's] 
recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board, the agency with the 
ultimate responsibility for classification". 348 U&S&, at 412. 
We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's 
contention, which was considered by the appeal board and 
denied by it. As was said in <Gonzales>, "it is the Appeal Board 
which renders the selective service determination considered 'final' 
in the courts, not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact. 
<Estep> v& <United States>, 327 U&S& 114". 348 
U& 
S&, at 412-413.   But there are other contentions which might 
be considered more difficult. At his trial, petitioner sought to secure 
through subpoena <duces tecum> the longhand notes of the Department's 
hearing officer, Evensen, as well as his report thereon. Petitioner 
also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal 
Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice. 
He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld; nor 
did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation reports might disclose.   Section 6 (~j) of the 
Act, 
as we have held, does require the Department's recommendation to 
be placed in a registrant's file. <Gonzales> v& <United States, 
supra>. But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing 
officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant. While 
the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report 
be placed in the registrant's file, this requirement was eliminated 
in 1952. Moreover, the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental, 
is directed to the Attorney General and, of course, is not 
the recommendation of the Department. It is not essentially different 
from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice, of 
which the Attorney General receives many, and to which he may give 
his approval or rejection. It is but part of the whole process within 
the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation 
to the appeal board.   It is also significant that neither this 
report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal 
board. Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only 
conclusions of the Department on file with the Board. Petitioner 
knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing 
officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his 
file. Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local 
board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board, petitioner 
cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed.

It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the 
production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial. 
In addition, petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the 
report and notes. While there are now allegations of the withholding 
of "favorable evidence developed at the hearing" and a denial of 
a "full and fair hearing", no such claim was made by petitioner at 
any stage of the administrative process. Moreover, his testimony at 
trial never developed any such facts. In the light of these circumstances, 
as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered 
entirely on the Department's recommendation, which petitioner 
repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found 
supported by the record, we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's 
report and notes.   Finally petitioner says that he was entitled 
to inspect the ~FBI report during the proceedings before the 
hearing officer as well as at the trial. He did receive a resume of 
it- the same that was furnished the appeal board- and he made no 
claim of its inaccuracy. Even now no such claim is asserted. He bases 
his present contention on the general right to explore, indicating that 
he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume. But this is fully 
answered by <United States> v& <Nugent, supra>. There we held 
"that the statutory scheme for review, within the selective service 
system, **h entitles [conscientious objectors] to no guarantee 
that 
the ~FBI reports must be produced for their inspection". 346 
U&S&, at 5-6. Even if we were not bound by <Nugent>, petitioner 
here would not be entitled to the report. The recommendation of 
the Department- as well as the decision of the appeal board- was 
based entirely on the local board file, not on an ~FBI report. 

#FOREIGN POLICY IN ITS TOTAL CONTEXT#

With this enlarged role in 
mind, I should like to make a few suggestions: What we in the United 
States do or do not do will make a very large difference in what 
happens in the rest of the world. We in this Department must think about 
foreign policy in its total context. We cannot regard foreign policy 
as something left over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal 
policy has been extracted. Foreign policy is the total involvement 
of the American people with peoples and governments abroad. That 
means that, if we are to achieve a new standard of leadership, we must 
think in terms of the total context of our situation. It is the concern 
of the Department of State that the American people are safe and 
secure- defense is not a monopoly concern of the Department of Defense. 
It is also the concern of the Department of State that our 
trading relationships with the rest of the world are vigorous, profitable, 
and active- this is not just a passing interest or a matter of 
concern only to the Department of Commerce. We can no longer rely on 
interdepartmental machinery "somewhere upstairs" to resolve differences 
between this and other departments. Assistant Secretaries of 
State will now carry an increased burden of active formulation and coordination 
of policies. Means must be found to enable us to keep in 
touch as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues 
in other departments concerned with foreign policy.   I think we 
need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action. Every 
policy officer cannot help but be a planning officer. Unless we keep 
our eyes on the horizon ahead, we shall fail to bring ourselves on target 
with the present. The movement of events is so fast, the pace so 
severe, that an attempt to peer into the future is essential if we are 
to think accurately about the present. If there is anything which we 
can do in the executive branch of the Government to speed up the processes 
by which we come to decisions on matters on which we must act 
promptly, that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct 
of our affairs. Action taken today is often far more valuable than action 
taken several months later in response to a situation then out of 
control.   There will of course be times for delay and inaction. 
What I am suggesting is that when we delay, or when we fail to act, 
we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic 
or procedural difficulties.   I also hope that we can 
do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas- an affliction 
of all bureaucracies. We want to stimulate ideas from the bottom 
to the top of the Department. We want to make sure that our junior 
colleagues realize that ideas are welcome, that initiative goes right
