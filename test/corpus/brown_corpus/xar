
The truth is, though, that men react differently to different 
treatment. For that matter, Stan Musial is rare, possessing the disposition 
that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers, reserving 
his opinions, but not 
his effort.   Mantle, it's apparent, 
resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the 
perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility. The old 
man was almost too possessive. Stengel inherited DiMaggio, Rizzuto, 
but HE brought up Mantle from Class ~C to the majors, from 
Joplin to New York.   With the speed and power of the body 
beautiful he saw before him, Ol' Case wanted No& 7 to be not 
only the best homerun hitter, but also the best bunter, base-runner and 
outfielder. Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when 
the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats.   Inheriting 
a more mature Mantle, who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway, 
Ralph Houk quietly bestowed, no pun intended, the mantle of 
authority on Mickey. The Major decided that, rather than be led, 
the slugger could lead. And what leadership a proud Mantle has given 
so far.   The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule, 
pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting 
target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr&, Mantle just might 
break the most glamorous record on the books, Babe Ruth's 60 homers 
of 1927. 

#FOUR FOR ALVIN#

Mays' day came a day earlier for 
Willie than for the kids and Commies this year. Willie's wonderful 
walloping Sunday- four home runs- served merely to emphasize how 
happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark.   Next to Leo Durocher, 
Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed 
up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month, to help the Giants 
win a dramatic pennant.

ROMANTIC news concerns Mrs& Joan Monroe Armour and 
F& Lee H& Wendell, who are to be married at 4:30 p& m& tomorrow 
in the Lake Forest home of her brother, J& Hampton Monroe, 
and Mrs& Monroe. Only the families and a dozen close friends 
will be present.   The bride's brother, Walter D& Monroe 
Jr&, will give her in marriage. In the small group will be the junior 
and senior Mrs& Walter Monroe; the bridegroom's parents, 
the Barrett Wendells, who are returning from a winter holiday in Sarasota, 
Fla&, for the occasion; and his brother, Mr& Wendell 
Jr&, and his wife, who will arrive from Boston. Mr& Wendell Jr& 
will be best man.   Also present will be the bride's children, 
Joan, 13, and Kirkland, 11. Their father is Charles B& Armour. 
The bridegroom's children were here for the Christmas holidays 
and can't return. Young Peter Wendell, a student at the Westminster 
school, has measles, and his sister, Mrs& Andrew Thomas, 
and her husband, who live in Missoula, Mont&, have a new baby. Their 
mother is Mrs& Camilla Alsop Wendell.   Mr& Wendell 
and his bride will live in his Lake Forest house. They will take a 
wedding trip later. #'BACK WITH THE MET'#

"We are back with 
the 'Met' again now that the 'Met' is back in 
Chicago", 
bulletins Mrs& Frank S& Sims, president of the women's board 
of the University of Chicago Cancer Research Foundation. The New 
York Metropolitan Opera Company will be here in May, and the board 
will sponsor the Saturday night, May 13, performance of "Turandot" 
as a benefit. Birgit Nilsson will be starred.   "Housed 
in the new McCormick Place theater, this should prove to be an 
exciting evening", adds Mrs& Sims. The board's last money raising 
event was a performance by Harry Belafonte- "quite off-beat 
for this group", decided some of the members. Mrs& Henry T& 
Sulcer of Winnetka, a new board member, will be chairman of publicity 
for the benefit. Her husband recently was appointed vice president 
of the university, bringing them back here from the east. 

#PARICHY-HAMM# 

Because of the recent death of the bride's father, Frederick 
B& Hamm, the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy 
will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St& Bernadine's church, 
Forest Park. A small reception will follow in the Oak Park Arms 
hotel.   Mrs& Hamm will not come from Vero Beach, Fla&, 
for the wedding. However, Mr& Parichy and his bride will go 
to Vero Beach on their wedding trip, and will stay in the John G& 
Beadles' beach house. The Beadles formerly lived in Lake Forest.

Harvey B& Stevens of Kenilworth will give his niece in 
marriage. Mr& and Mrs& Stevens and the bride's other uncles 
and aunts, the Rush C& Butlers, the Homer E& Robertsons, and 
the David Q& Porters, will give the bridal dinner tonight in the 
Stevenses' home. 

#HERE AND THERE#

The Chicago Press club will 
fete George E& Barnes, president of the United States Lawn 
Tennis association, at a cocktail party and buffet supper beginning 
at 5:30 p& m& tomorrow. Later, a bus will carry members to the 
Chicago Stadium to see Jack Kramer's professional tennis matches 
at 8 p& m&.

WITH loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-St& 
Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears, its director, 
Helen Tieken Geraghty [Mrs& Maurice P& Geraghty] 
is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even 
greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International 
Trade fair. Armed with letters from embassies to ministers 
of countries, especially those in the near and far east, Mrs& 
Geraghty "will beat the bushes for oriental talent".   "We 
[the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry] expect to establish 
closer relations with nations and their cultural activities, 
and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts", 
explains Mrs& Geraghty. "For instance, Djakarta, Indonesia, 
has three groups of dancers interested in coming here. I'm even going 
to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus"!   The 
last obstacle in Mrs& Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed 
out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that 
his brother would meet her at the border of that country- so newly 
separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't 
been able to obtain a visa. 

#FIRST, HONOLULU#

Honolulu will be 
Mrs& Geraghty's first stop. Then Japan, Hong Kong, Manila, 
India, Pakistan, Damascus, Beirut, and to Rome, London, and Paris 
"to look over wonderful talent".   Dec& 22 is the deadline 
for Mrs& Geraghty's return; the Geraghtys' youngest daughter, 
Molly, bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next 
night. Molly already has her cotillion gown, and it's fitted, says 
her mother. Also, invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut 
tea the afternoon of Dec& 29 in the Arts club.   It won't 
be a "tea", however, but more of an international folk song festival, 
with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas 
songs from around the world. The international theme will be continued 
with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will 
give in the Racquet club after the tea. Miss Abra Prentice's 
debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day. 

#BURKE-ROSTAGNO# 

The Richard S& Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting 
for the wedding reception for their daughter, Helen Lambert, and the 
young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during 
her junior year at Smith college. He is Aldo Rostagno, son of the 
Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in 
Europe. The Burkes, who now live in Kankakee, are telling friends 
of the engagement.   Miss Burke, a graduate of Miss Hall's 
school, stayed on in Florence as a career girl. Her fiance, who is with 
a publishing firm, translates many books from English into Italian. 
He will be coming here on business in December, when the wedding 
is to take place in Wayne. Miss Burke will arrive in December also. 

#HERE AND THERE#

A farewell supper Mr& and Mrs& Charles 
H& Sethness Jr& planned Sunday for Italian Consul General 
and Mrs& Giacomo Profili has been canceled because Mr& Sethness 
is in Illinois Masonic hospital for surgery.   Mrs& William 
Odell, Mrs& Clinton B& King, John Holabird Jr&, Norman 
Boothby, and Actress Maureen O'Sullivan will judge the costumes 
in the grand march at the Affaire Old Towne Bal Masque tomorrow 
in the Germania club. The party is to raise money for the Old Town 
Art center and to plant more crabapple trees along the streets of 
Old Town.

{The Living Room has 
another scoop: Jane Russell will make one of her rare night club

**h Johnny Ray, at the same L& R&, has something to
