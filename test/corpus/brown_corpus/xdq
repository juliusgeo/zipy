Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American 
composer, a particular type of music or the music of a given 
country.   It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is 
set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene. But 
one wishes, when the appetite is whetted, as it was in the case of 
the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera, that further opportunity 
would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety 
and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.

THE Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square 
Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before 
it brings its long American tour to a close.   It is not simply 
giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York 
engagement earlier this season, but has brought back many of the numbers 
that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's 
heart.   It is good to see those numbers again. The "Suite 
of Old Russian Dances" that opened that inaugural program 
with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into 
typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth; the amusing "Yurochka", 
in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance; the 
lovely (and of course vigorous) "Polyanka" or "The Meadow"; 
the three Moldavian dances entitled "Zhok"; the sweet and funny 
little dance about potato planting called "Bul'ba"; and 
the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called "City 
Quadrille" are all just as good as one remembers them to have been, 
and they are welcome back.

So, for that matter, are the newer 
dances- the "Kalmuk Dance" with its animal movements, that genial 
juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called "The Platter", the 
rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called "Summer", "The 
Three Shepherds" of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs, 
and, of course, the trenchant "Rock 'n' Roll". 
As autumn starts its annual sweep, few Americans and Canadians realize 
how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring. 
Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire 
land surface of the earth. The only other regions so blessed are the 
British Isles, western Europe, eastern China, southern Chile and 
parts of Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania. Their autumn tints are 
all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson, gold, 
purple, bronze, blue and vermilion that flame up in North America. 
Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle; 
in fact, a freezing autumn dulls the blaze. The best effects come 
from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain, 
followed by sunny days and cool nights. Foliage pilgrimages, either 
organized or individual, are becoming an autumn item for more and 
more Americans each year. Below is a specific guide, keyed to the calendar. 

#NATURE#


_CANADA._ Late September finds Quebec's 
color at its peak, especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area 
south of the St& Lawrence River. In the Maritime provinces farther 
east, the tones are a little quieter. Ontario's foliage is most 
vivid from about Sept& 23 to Oct& 10, with both Muskoka (100 
miles north of Toronto) and Haliburton (125 miles northwest of Toronto) 
holding color cavalcades starting Sept& 23. In the Canadian 
Rockies, great groves of aspen are already glinting gold. _NEW ENGLAND._ 
Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept& 25 to Oct& 
15, and often hit a height in early October. New Hampshire figures 
its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including 
the yellow of the birches. The shades tend to be a little softer 
in the forests that blanket so much of Maine. In western Massachusetts 
and northwest Connecticut, the Berkshires are at their vibrant 
prime the first week of October. 

#MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES._ The 
Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October, choice routes being 
9~N from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake 
Placid area. Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color 
over the Catskills in mid-October, notably along routes 23 and 23~A. 
About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania 
are magnificent- Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival 
on Oct& 14, 15. New Jersey's color varies from staccato 
to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May. _SOUTHEAST._ 
During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and 
other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from 
Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia. The most brilliant displays 
are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley 
and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee. 

_MIDWEST._ Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have many 
superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few 
days of September well into October, especially in their northern sections, 
<e&g&>, Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama 
celebration 
is Sept& 29-Oct& 8. In Wisconsin, take route 55 north 
of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie du Chien. 
In Michigan, there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits, 
while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the 
Upper Peninsula are spectacular. In Minnesota, Arrowhead County 
and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding. Farther 
south, there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks, with some 
seasonal peaks as late as early November. Illinois' Shawnee 
National Forest, Missouri's Iron County and the maples of Hiawatha, 
Kan& should be at their best in mid-October. _THE WEST._ 
The Rockies have many "Aspencades", which are organized tours 
of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage points for viewing 
the golden panoramas. In Colorado, Ouray has its Fall Color Week 
Sept& 22-29, Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept& 24, 
and Steamboat Springs has a week-long Aspencade Sept& 25-30. 
New Mexico's biggest is at Ruidoso Oct& 7, 8, while Alamogordo 
and Cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips Oct& 1. 

#AMERICANA# 


_PLEASURE DOMES._ Two sharply contrasting places designed for 
public enjoyment are now on display.   The Corn Palace at Mitchell, 
S& Dak&, "the world's corniest building", has a carnival through 
Sept& 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt. 
Since 1892 ears of red, yellow, purple and white corn have annually 
been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create hugh "paintings". The 
1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial Centennial, with the pictures 
including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first river steamboat, 
the 1876 gold rush, a little red schoolhouse on the prairie, and 
today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs. The panels 
will stay up until they are replaced next summer.   Longwood 
Gardens, near Kennett Square, Pa& (about 12 miles from Wilmington, 
Del&), was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre S& 
du Pont. Every Wednesday night through Oct& 11 there will be 
an elaborate colored fountain display, with 229 nozzles throwing jets 
of water up to 130 feet. The "peacock tail" nozzle throws a giant 
fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high. The gardens themselves 
are open free of charge the year round, and the 192 permanent employes 
make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out 
by any visitor. The greenhouses alone cover 3-1/2 acres. 

#BOOKS# 


_CLOCK WITHOUT HANDS._ Carson McCullers, after a long, painful 
illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul, has come 
back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller 
lists even before official publication. Though the subject- segregation 
in her native South- has been thoroughly worked, Miss McCullers 
uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm 
her place at the very top of modern American writing. @ _FRANNY 
AND ZOOEY._ With an art that almost conceals art, J& D& Salinger 
can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts. Here, in 
the most eagerly awaited novel of the season (his first since <The 
Catcher in the Rye>), he tells of a college girl in flight from the 
life around her and the tart but sympathetic help she gets from her 
25-year-old brother. @ _THE HEAD OF MONSIEUR M&,_ Althea Urn. 
A deft, hilarious satire on very high French society involving a 
statesman with two enviable possessions, a lovely young bride and a head 
containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove 
it for greater comfort. There is probably a moral in all this about 
"mind <vs&> heart". @ _A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH._ Virgilia 
Peterson, a critic by trade, has turned her critical eye pitilessly 
and honestly on herself in an autobiography more of the mind and 
heart than of specific events. It is an engrossing commentary on a repressive, 
upper-middle-class New York way of life in the first part 
of this 
century. @ _DARK RIDER._ This retelling by Louis Zara of 
the brief, anguished life of Stephen Crane- poet and master novelist 
at 23, dead at 28- is in novelized form but does not abuse its tragic 
subject. @ _RURAL FREE,_ Rachel Peden. Subtitled <A Farmwife's 
Almanac of Country Living>, this is a gentle and nostalgic 
chronicle of the changing seasons seen through the clear, humorous 
eye of a Hoosier housewife and popular columnist. @ 

#DANCE#


_RUSSIANS, 
FILIPINOS._ Two noted troupes from overseas will get the 
fall dance season off to a sparkling start. Leningrad's Kirov Ballet, 
famous for classic purity of technique, begins its first U&S& 
tour in New York (through Sept& 30). The Bayanihan Philippine 
Dance Company, with music and dances that depict the many facets 
of Filipino culture, opens its 60-city U&S& tour in San Francisco 
(through Sept& 24) then, via one-night stands, moves on to 
Los 
los Angeles (Sept& 29-Oct& 1). 

#FESTIVALS#


_ACROSS THE LAND._ 
With harvests in full swing, you can enjoy festivals for grapes 
at Sonoma, Calif& (Sept& 22-24), as well as for cranberries 
at Bandon, Ore& (Sept& 28-Oct& 1), for buckwheat at Kingwood, 
W& Va& (Sept& 28-30), sugar cane at New Iberia, La& (Sept& 
29-Oct& 1) and tobacco at Richmond, Va& (Sept& 23-30).

The mule is honored at Benson, N&C& (Sept& 22,23) 
and at Boron, Calif& (Sept& 24-Oct& 1), while the legend 
of 
the Maid of the Mist is celebrated at Niagara Falls through the 
24th. The fine old mansions of U&S& Grant's old home town of 
Galena, Ill& are open for inspection (Sept& 23, 24). An archery 
tournament will be held at North Falmouth, Mass& (Sept& 23, 
24). The 300th anniversaries of Staten Island (through Sept& 23) 
and of Mamaroneck, N&Y& (through Sept& 24) will both include 
parades and pageants.
