The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would 
reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary 
cuts and lay-offs effective at 12.01 A&M& next Saturday. The 
current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000.   Howard E& 
Simpson, the railroad's president, said, "A drastic decline in 
freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement 
of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action".   The 
reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in 
which the B& + O& operates. 

#SALARY CUT AND LAY-OFFS#

It 
will be accomplished in two ways: _1._ A flat reduction of 10 per 
cent in the salary of all officers, supervisors and other employees 
not belonging to unions. There are about 3,325 officers and employees 
in this class. _2._ Sufficient lay-offs of union employees to 
bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.   Since 
the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members 
under contract, it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some 
of the men on furlough, a B&+O& spokesman said.   Those 
union members kept on their jobs, therefore, will not take a cut in their 
wages.   The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot 
be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending 
on what men are most needed on the job.

A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night 
after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount streets.   The 
victim, Norman B& Wiley, 38, of the 900 block North Charles street, 
was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery.

The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got 
out of the cab with his money. The victim was beaten when he attempted 
to stop the bandit.   He said the assailant, who was armed 
with a .45-caliber automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania avenue 
and Gold street.   In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41, 
proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken street, told police 
two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash 
register after choking and beating him.

A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously 
injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel 
county home.   The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1, 
was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital 
in Annapolis.   His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and 
John Raymond, Jr& 22 months, were admitted to the hospital. The 
girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body. 

#BOY IN FAIR CONDITION#

The boy received second-degree burns of 
the face, neck and back. His condition was reported to be fair.

Police said the children's mother, Mrs& Eleanor Somerville, 
was visiting next door when the fire occurred.   The house is 
on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park, at Jones Station, 
police said. 

_ANNAPOLIS, JAN& 7_- The Anne Arundel county school superintendent

David S& Jenkins after he and Mrs& D& Ellwood Williams, 
Jr&, 
a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent, argued 
for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.   The disagreement 
was over what Dr& Jenkins had said at a previous session
