R& B& Gregg has written that "non-violence and good will of 
the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical 
jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance. He 
suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent 
resistance of most victims would render him"; and again, that 
"the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object 
of war- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will, 
to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope. In another respect 
it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent 
only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is 
based on sounder values".   A trial of strength, however, is made 
quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent 
resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder 
values than those of his opponent; and in warfare with any means, 
men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause. This makes necessary 
a morality of means, and principles governing the <conduct> of 
resistance whenever this is thought to be justified. The question, 
then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent 
means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes 
and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing 
him. Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some 
causes as more important than their lives; and to them it will seem 
insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently. 
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into 
the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem 
the more unlimited aggression.   Among Christian groups, the 
Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that 
the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the 
Christian use of all forms of pressure. Since the will and word of God 
are for them concentrated in Christlike love, it seems clear to them 
that non-violent resistance is quite another thing. "The primary 
objective of non-violence", writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, 
"is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain 
desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage". 
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must 
certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any 
form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and 
affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine 
the moral principles limiting resistance. These principles we 
have now set forth. <Economy> in the use of power needs not only to 
be asserted, but clearly specified; and when this is done it will 
be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across 
the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to 
both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action. 
Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a 
<barely 
intolerable> pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed. 
That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly 
in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals. There 
must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use 
of means of resistance, violent or non-violent. The justification 
in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays 
down its limitation- in the distinction between the persons against 
whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted 
also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the 
sake even of achieving some great good. In these terms, the "economic 
withdrawal" of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading 
in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these 
distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be 
singled out.   We may now take up for consideration a hard case 
which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure 
or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above. 
There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken 
at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination 
against a whole people. An excellent article was published recently in 
the journal of the Church Peace Union by a South African journalist 
on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa, 
amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic <complicity> of both 
the government and the people of the United States in these conditions. 
"**h Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors 
but also from the pockets of U& S& taxpayers", this author 
states, "are being poured into South Africa to support a system 
dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical 
exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens 
not to be white". Both the conditions and the complicity are documented 
in considerable detail. This leads to the conclusion that "the 
fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not 
<apartheid> shall continue". Our leadership in a wide economic 
boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with 
the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as 
a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our 
own country, but also in accord with our law, U&S& Code Title 
19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced 
or convict labor. Not only should this provision be enforced but 
other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author 
believes, "must surely be supported by every American who values the 
freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated 
by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly 
contribute to the enslavement of another nation".

NORTHERN liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights 
and of integration. They have also led the nation in the direction 
of a welfare state. And both in their objectives of non-discrimination 
and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners 
who are called Bourbons. The name presumably derives from the 
French royal house which never learned and never forgot; since Bourbon 
whiskey, though of Kentucky origin, is at least as much favored 
by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South.   The 
nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little 
understood in the North. The race problem has tended to obscure other, 
less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive. 
It is these other differences between North and South- other, 
that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare- 
which I chiefly discuss herein.   I write about Northern liberals 
from considerable personal experience. A Southerner married to 
a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting 
town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men, 
and business executives of egghead tastes. Most of them are Democrats 
and nearly all consider themselves, and are viewed as, liberals. This 
is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of 
liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center 
are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that 
the best government was the least government. Yet paradoxically my 
liberal 
friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints. 
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and 
democracy, I find that they fall into two categories: the simpler 
ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without 
analysis; and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that 
these things don't count any more in the world of to-day. I am naive, 
they say, to make use of such words.   I take this to mean 
that the intelligent- and therefore necessarily cynical?- liberal 
considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will 
assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual 
and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield 
before it. This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian 
bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try 
to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court. As for states' 
rights, they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends 
except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist 
now only as anachronisms.   The American liberal may, in the world 
of to-day, have a strong case; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed 
in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one. Why, in the first place, 
call himself a liberal if he is against <laissez-faire> and favors 
an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over 
everybody? If he attaches little importance to personal liberty, 
why not make this known to the world? And if he is so scornful of 
the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution 
that he could more sincerely support?   I am concerned here, 
however, with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South. It 
appears to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort 
to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends. His assumption 
seems to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more 
liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy 
with his views. <Time's> editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, 
<The Waist-High Culture>, wrote: "**h most of what was 
different about it (the Deep South) I found myself unsympathetic to 
**h". This, for the liberals I know, would be an understatement. 
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate 
hatred that was directed against Fascism.   I do not think 
that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the 
North. In business circles, usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere 
would hardly be found. But in our case- and neither my wife nor 
I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional 
outbursts- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and 
come close to wrecking several more. In fact it has caused us to give 
serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy 
for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host 
is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners 
who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards 
down.   Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in 
the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state-supported 
universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority 
view. But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected 
to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in 
social gatherings. From my wife's experience and other sources, this 
seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles. The strong feeling 
is certainly there; but there is a leavening of liberalism among 
college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who 
studied in the North. And social relations arising out of business 
ties impose courtesy, if not sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners. 
Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the 
prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.   There 
are of course many Souths; but for this discussion the most important 
division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who 
haven't. My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed 
rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War. Nobody 
knows how many Southerners there are in this category. I suspect 
that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to 
believe. I never heard of a poll being taken on the question. No doubt 
such a thing would be considered unpatriotic. Prior to 1954 I imagine 
that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy. 
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is 
more doubtful; and if a poll had been taken immediately following 
the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would 
have been for the Old South.   Belief in the traditional way of 
life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones. Probably 
a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain 
unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia, North Carolina, and 
Alabama following along after them. Old attitudes are held more tenaciously 
in the Tidewater than the Piedmont; so that a line running 
down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater 
would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course, 
important minority enclaves.   The long-settled areas of states 
like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture 
to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and 
the consciousness of loss the greater. Also, we should not even to-day 
discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering 
on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies 
than with the North even after independence. The social and psychological
