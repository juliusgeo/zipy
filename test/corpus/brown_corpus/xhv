his old friend Van Schaack. Yet when, at war's end, the ex-Tory 
made the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote him from 
Paris, where he was negotiating the peace settlement: 
"As 
an independent American I considered all who were not for us, and you 
amongst the rest, as against us, yet be assured that John Jay never 
ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack".   The latter 
in turn assured him that "were I arraigned at the bar, and you my 
judge, I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause".

All seven recognized that independence was but the first 
step toward building a nation. "We have now a national character 
to establish", Washington wrote in 1783. "Think continentally", 
Hamilton counseled the young nation. This new force, love of country, 
super-imposed upon- if not displacing- affectionate ties to one's 
own state, was epitomized by Washington. His first inaugural 
address speaks of "my country whose voice I can never hear but with 
veneration and love".   All sought the fruition of that nationalism 
in a Federal Government with substantial powers. Save Jefferson, 
all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal 
Constitution. They supported it, not as a perfect instrument, but as 
the best obtainable. Historians have traditionally regarded the great 
debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized 
vs& limited government, with Hamilton and the nationalists 
supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter 
position. ##

THE state's rights position was formulated by 
Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves, but 
in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better 
Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians. In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson 
had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution, 
and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's 
bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception, and in 
adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff. Indeed, the old Jeffersonians 
were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they 
were to the Jacksonian Democrats. ##

WHEN, in 1832, the South 
Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition 
which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited 
no encouragement from that senior statesman. In his political testament, 
"Advice to My Country", penned just before his death, Madison 
expressed the wish "that the Union of the States be cherished 
and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora 
with her box opened; and the disguised one, as the serpent creeping 
with his deadly wiles into Paradise". 

#TOBACCO ROAD IS DEAD. LONG LIVE TOBACCO ROAD.#

Nostalgic Yankee 
readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians 
that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway, over 
which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the 
Dow-Jones average than with the cotton crop. Thus we are compelled 
to face the urbanization of the South- an urbanization which, despite 
its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture, 
has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers. Indeed, it 
seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road, 
with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint 
juleps, continue to live- but only as a weary, overexploited phantom.

Those writers known collectively as the "Southern school" 
have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize; 
according to many critics, in fact, the South has led the North 
in literature since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren 
have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum 
renaissance. It is interesting, however, that despite this 
strong upsurge in Southern writing, almost none of the writers has 
forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel 
sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the 
season's cotton and tobacco crops; of the stereotyped Negro servants 
chanting hymns as they plow the fields; of these and a host of 
other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps 
of the past century. This is not to say that the South is no longer 
agrarian; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification. 
But the South is, and has been for the past century, engaged 
in a wide-sweeping urbanization which, oddly enough, is not reflected 
in its literature.   In 1900 the South was only 15% urban; 
in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban. In a mere half-century the South 
has more than tripled its urban status. There is a New South emerging, 
a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with 
the rapidity of an avalanche- especially within recent decades. As 
the New South snowballs toward further urbanization, it becomes more 
and more homogeneous with the North- a tendency which Willard 
Thorp terms "Yankeefication", as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte, 
Birmingham, and Houston. It is said that, even at the present 
stage of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly 
unlike Columbus or Trenton. Undoubtedly even the old Southern 
stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind: William Styron mentions 
in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead McGruder, a Civil 
War general, now renamed, in typical California fashion, "Buena 
Vista Terrace". The effects of television and other mass media 
are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force. 
As for progress, the "backward South" can boast of Baton Rouge, 
which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred 
and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second largest growth of the period 
for all cities over 25,000.   The field, then, is ripe for 
new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century 
phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication: the new urban economy, 
the city-dweller, the pains of transition, the labor problems; the 
list is, obviously, endless. But these sources have not been tapped. 
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism, exaggerating 
the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque, but 
as unreal as- or even <more> unreal than- yesterday. William 
Styron, while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance, 
insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and 
yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes. 
Even the great god Faulkner, the South's one probable contender 
for literary immortality, has little concerned himself with these matters; 
such are simply not within his bounded province.   Where 
are the writers to treat these changes? Has the agrarian tradition 
become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded 
or unwanted? Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the 
older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated 
testings over the decades. Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to 
write of a <new> economy, these writers seem to be contenting themselves 
with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.

An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region 
may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in 
the white-dominated society, a problem that has been reflected in regional 
fiction especially since 1865. Today the Negro must discover his 
role in an <industrialized> South, which indicates that the racial 
aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically, but rather 
has gradually come to be reflected in this new context, this new coat 
of paint. The Negro faces as much, if not more, difficulty in fitting 
himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one. This 
represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem. But there 
have been abrupt changes as well: the sit-ins, the picket lines, 
the bus strikes- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago. 
Today's evidence, such as the fact that only three Southern states 
(South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi) still openly defy integration, 
would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness.

Other examples of <gradual> changes that have 
affected the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the busses; 
his requesting, and often getting, higher wages, better working conditions, 
better schools- changes that were slowly emerging even before 
the Supreme Court decision of 1954. Then came this decision, which 
sped the process of gaining equality (or perhaps hindered it; only 
historical evolution will determine which): an <abrupt> change.

Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led 
to an ironically anarchical rebellion. He has frequently refused to move 
from white lunch counters, refused to obey <local> laws which he 
considers unjust, while in other cases he has appealed to <federal> 
laws. This bold self-assertion, after decades of humble subservience, 
is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon, an abrupt change in the Southern 
way of existence. A new order is thrusting itself into being. 
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation, 
uncertainty, and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role 
in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white 
man.   The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern 
fiction. It is clear that, while most writers enjoy picturing 
the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble old agrarian who mutters "yassuhs" 
and "sho' nufs" with blissful deference to his white employer 
(or, in Old South terms, "massuh"), this stereotype is doomed 
to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester. While 
there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through 
the rural South, such men appear to be a vanishing breed. Writers 
openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man; 
but they obviously mean by this, not a Negro personality, but a Negro 
<type>. Presenting an individualized Negro character, it would 
seem, is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could 
tackle; and the success of such an endeavor is, as suggested above, 
glaringly rare.   Just as the Negro situation points up the 
gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life, it also points up 
the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature. The book 
concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed; 
recently only Keith Wheeler's novel, <Peaceable Lane>, has 
openly faced the problem.   All but the most rabid of Confederate 
flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in 
actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance 
of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid 
ante-bellum way of life. Many earlier writers, mourning the demise 
of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate this "gracious 
Old South" imagery, creating such lasting impressions as Margaret 
Mitchell's 
"Tara" plantation. Modern writers, who are supposed 
to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist 
upon drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when it well deserves 
a rest after the overexploitation of the past century. Perhaps 
these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing; but 
they can hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama is dead. 
As John T& Westbrook says in his article, "Twilight of Southern 
Regionalism" (<Southwest Review>, Winter 1957): "**h 
The miasmal mausoleum where an Old South, already too minutely 
autopsied in prose and poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever 
dead and (let us fervently hope) forever done with".   Westbrook 
further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image 
of their homeland, which is too readily assimilated by both foreign 
readers and visiting Yankees: "Our northerner is suspicious of 
all this crass evidence [of urbanization] presented to his senses. 
It bewilders and befuddles him. He is too deeply steeped in William 
Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren. The fumes of progress are in his 
nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes, but his 
heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night 
riders. On this trip to the South he wants, above all else, to sniff
