located strategic forces, we must have a hunter-killer capability 
<in addition> to our missiles. Until this hunter-killer operation 
can be performed by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only 
means available to us.   It seems reasonable that if general 
nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's 
citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance 
aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and 
destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us. 
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile ~ICBM 
force. It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the ~B-52 
or ~B-70 in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based 
missiles. If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton 
nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which 
may be more appropriate for most important military targets, it would 
seem that the ~B-52 or ~B-70 could carry a great many small 
nuclear weapons.   An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons 
could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains 
operating within a specified geographic area of Russia- provided that 
we had used some of our ~ICBMs to degrade Russia's air defenses 
before our bombers got there. The aircraft could be used to destroy 
other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets as well as 
the known, fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by 
missile.   Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important 
role for manned military aircraft? Is there any other way to do 
the job?   Survivability of our strategic forces (Polaris, 
mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan, and airborne 
Skybolt) means that it will take some time, perhaps weeks, to destroy 
a strategic force. War, under these circumstances, cannot be one 
massive exchange of nuclear devastation. Forces <will survive> a surprise 
attack, and these forces will give depth, or considerable duration, 
to the conflict. ##

THE forces which survive the initial 
attack 
must be found and destroyed. Even mobile forces must be found and 
destroyed. But, how does one go about the job of finding and destroying 
mobile forces? They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction 
by ballistic missile.   Some day, many years in the future, true 
spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets. But until 
we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to the hunter-killer 
problem is manned aircraft.   However, the aircraft which we have 
today are tied to large, "soft" airfields. Nuclear rockets can 
destroy airfields with ease. Here then is our problem: aircraft are 
vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions 
which a missile is totally incapable of performing; but the airfield, 
on which the aircraft is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile. 
This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission, weapon. 
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.

This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft 
in favor of the missile. But remember this- it isn't the <aircraft> 
which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets, it is the <airfield>. 
Eliminate the <vulnerability of aircraft on the ground> and you 
have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic 
missiles.   There are <four rather obvious ways> to reduce or 
eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground:   @ Put 
aircraft in "bomb-proof" hangars when they are on the ground.

@ Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small (3,000-foot) 
airfields with runways. If we could use all the small airfields 
we have in this country, we could disperse our strategic aircraft 
by a factor of 10 or more.   @ Use nuclear propulsions to keep 
our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their 
useful life.   @ Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines, 
develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (~VTOL) long-range 
military aircraft.   We have the technology today with which to 
build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 ~psi. We 
could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters. 
Large, 
long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability 
to take off from 3,000-foot runways, but they would require more powerful 
engines than we have today. There is little enthusiasm for spending 
money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief 
that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.   This 
same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted 
in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft. 
One seldom hears the analogy "nuclear propulsion will do for 
the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine".   If, 
for some reason such as economy, we are not going to develop aircraft 
nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency, then we should 
turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio 
of 12 or 15 to one. With powerplants such as these, vertical takeoff 
and landing combat aircraft could be built. For example, a 12-to-one 
engine would power a <supersonic> ~VTOL fighter. With a 15-to-one 
engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise 
vertically. The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to 
develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a 
billion dollars- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft 
are obsolete.   When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields, 
they are no longer vulnerable to ~ICBMs. If our ~SAC 
bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and 
<because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability 
to strike at Russia again, and again, and again>, those bombers would 
unquestionably assure our military dominance.   We would have 
the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force- whether it 
were fixed or mobile. With such a force of manned bombers we could bring 
enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure would be 
selective and extremely discriminating. No need to kill an entire city 
and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance 
to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.   Our first 
necessity, at the very outset of war, is post-attack reconnaissance. 
In a few years we will have ~SAMOS (semiautomatic missile observation 
system). But in the case of moving targets, and targets which 
have limited mobility, what will their location be when it is time to 
destroy them? What targets have we successfully knocked out? A 
ballistic missile cannot, today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful. 
What targets still remain to be hit? These crucial questions 
must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance. ~SAMOS will 
be hard put to see through clouds- and to see in the dark. 
Even if this is some day possible, there remains the 30-minute time 
of flight of a missile to its overseas target. If the target can change 
its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in 
the air on its way, the probability of the missile destroying the target 
is drastically reduced.   <Pre>-attack reconnaissance is vital 
but only <post>-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate 
the war favorably. It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather 
that post-attack reconnaissance. It could operate under the clouds 
and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night. 
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately 
destroy any targets it discovered- no need to wait for a missile 
to come all the way from the United States with the chance that 
the target, if it were mobile, would be gone.   A large aircraft, 
such as the ~B-52 or ~B-70, could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small 
nuclear weapons. Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive 
power will create 1,000 ~psi overpressure at 100 feet. Or 
put 
another way, the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed 
by placing a one-kiloton warhead (1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki) within 100 to 200 feet of the target!

It is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large 
yield nuclear weapons.   Today we have side-looking radar which 
has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual 
buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate spans of bridges, etc&. 
With these keen "eyes" and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy, 
military forces can be directly attacked <with minimum damage 
to urban areas>.   If we fail to develop the means to hunt down 
and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision, 
and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace, 
our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.

THE LYRIC BEAUTIES of Schubert's <Trout> Quintet- 
its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies- make it a source 
of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners. But for students of 
musical forms and would-be classifiers, the work presents its problems. 
Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the 
category of chamber music- yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument 
generally regarded as symphonic. Moreover, the piece is written 
in five movements, rather than the conventional four of most quintets, 
and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.   The 
many and frequent performances of the <Trout> serve to emphasize 
the dual nature of its writing. Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions, 
with the contrabass given free rein. Other interpretations present 
the music as an essentially intimate creation. In these readings, 
the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background, or it 
is dressed in clown's attire- the musical equivalent of a bull in 
a china shop. Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches, 
when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer 
than ten different performances. The occasion for this marathon: 
Angel's long-awaited reissue in its "Great Recordings of the 
Century" series of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version. Let me say at 
the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as 
it did on the first.   Whether considered alone or in relation 
to other editions, ~COLH 40 is a document of prime importance. 
Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart 
players of all time, and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable. 
But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great 
performer, and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to 
are by Schnabel pupils (Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian Aeschbacher, 
and Victor Babin) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical 
skills. Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian 
renditions, most notably the "Schnabel trill" (which differs 
from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously). 
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction 
as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each 
student's approach as distinctly his own.   Schnabel's emphasis 
on structural clarity, his innate rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous 
intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one. Yet no 
detail was too small to receive attention from this master, and as a 
result the playing here has humor, delicacy, and radiant humanity. This 
is a serious-minded interpretation, but it is never strait-laced. And 
although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously 
faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications. 
The piano performance on this <Trout> is one that really demands 
a search for superlatives.   About the Pro Arte's contribution 
I am less happy. I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't 
collaborate with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic 
playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook 
than the style of the Belgian group. From a technical standpoint, 
the string playing is good, but the Pro Arte people fail to enter 
into the spirit of things here. The violinist, in particular, is very 
indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched and edgy. 
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone, 
but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very 
quiet. There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation 
in the "<Forellen>" movement, and I suspect that this is 
due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original ~SPs.

Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's (London) offers 
the most sophisticated keyboard work. Every detail in his interpretation
