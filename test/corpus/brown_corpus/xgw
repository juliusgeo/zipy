March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue 
of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum, 
would be sent "on indefinite loan" to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's 
birthplace. Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors 
promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his 
own hostility to this art form. They dug up a speech he had made two 
years earlier as a Congressman, decrying the more than two hundred 
statues, monuments, and memorials which "dot the Washington landscape 
**h as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching 
new plans". Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall had proposed 
that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.

He is not likely to win this battle easily. In the 
case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce 
that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no 
desire to "hustle" it out of Washington. The last Congress adopted 
seven bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko, 
the Ukrainian poet laureate; eleven others were introduced. Active 
warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first 
Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac, and T& 
R&'s own living children, who wish to preserve the island as 
a wildlife sanctuary. The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin 
D& Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved with 
his speeches (and promptly dubbed by one of its critics, "Instant 
Stonehenge"), is another of Udall's headaches, since as supervisor 
of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility 
for building it.   "Washington", President Kennedy 
has been heard to remark ironically, "is a city of southern efficiency 
and northern charm". There have been indications that he hopes 
to redress that situation, commencing with the White House. One of 
Mrs& Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state 
of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national 
shrine. Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture 
assembled by President Thomas Jefferson, the White House has collected 
a hodgepodge of period pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.

Mrs& Kennedy shows a determination to change all this. 
Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk, hewed from 
the timbers of the British ship H&M&S& <Resolute> and 
presented to 
President Hayes by Queen Victoria. It now serves the President 
in his oval office. Later, browsing in an old issue of the 
<Gazette des Beaux-Arts,> she found a description of a handsome gilt 
pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe. She traced 
it to a storage room. With its coating of gold radiator paint removed- 
a gaucherie of some earlier tenant- it will now occupy its 
rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White 
House.   But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century 
furniture (which Mrs& Kennedy feels is the proper period 
for 
the White House) must be pursued in places other than government storage 
rooms. 
The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee 
for the White House, to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange 
ways to acquire them. Her effort to put the home of living Presidents 
on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes 
no party lines. By rough estimate her Committee, headed by Henry 
Francis Du Pont, contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats.

The press releases emanating from the White House give 
a clue to the activity within. A curator has been appointed. A valuable 
pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-Honore 
Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein 
and now hangs in the Blue Room. The American Institute 
of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library. Secretary 
and Mrs& Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire 
furniture, including Dolley Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room 
in that style. And part of a fabulous collection of <vermeil> hollowware, 
bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs& Margaret 
Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display 
in the State dining room.   Woman's place is in the home: 
man must attend to matters of the yard. One of the vexatious problems 
to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just 
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. Congress had 
already appropriated money, and plans were well along to tear down the 
buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one 
critic calls the "marble monumentality" of government office buildings. 
While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to 
preserve the Belasco Theater, as well as the Dolley Madison and the 
Benjamin Taylor houses, all scheduled for razing.   What to 
do about it now that he was President? Only a few days after moving 
into the White House. Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square. 
Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem 
to him, with instructions to work out what was best- provided it 
didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.   The situation 
involved some political perils. One of the offices slated for reconstruction 
is the aged Court of Claims, diagonally across the street 
from the White House. Logically, it should be moved downtown. But 
Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court, is an elderly 
gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk 
to work. More importantly, he also happens to be the brother-in-law 
of Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.   There were aesthetic 
problems as well as political. On delving deeper, Walton discovered 
that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified 
as "early nondescript". The old Belasco Theater, over which many 
people had grown sentimental, was only a shell of its former self 
after arduous years as a ~USO Center. The Dolley Madison House, 
Walton concluded, was scarcely worth preserving. "The attempt 
to save the Square's historic value", he declares, "came half a 
century too late". 
Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious and beautiful. The 
buildings are mostly Georgian. The Dartmouth student does not live 
in monastic seclusion, as he once did. But his is still a simple life 
relatively free of the female presence or influence, and he must go 
far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated pleasures. He is 
still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence, if he chooses to be.

He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the 
last century, down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal 
for book learning in his heart. The men's shops on Hanover's 
Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven. 
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend, 
toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke, are no less rakish than 
those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia. But there has 
always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth. The would-be sophisticate 
and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment. No one 
here pokes fun at manly virtues. And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie 
probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League. It even affects 
the faculty.   Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival- 
widely recognized as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend 
anywhere, any time- was broadcast over a national television hookup, 
Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter 
garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been 
acquired from a Smith girl. President Dickey's golden retriever, 
frolicking in the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine 
informality.   This carefree disdain for "side" cropped up 
again in the same television broadcast. Dean Thaddeus Seymour, wearing 
ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival. 
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown 
on her head. So he kissed her. No Dartmouth man was surprised.

Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal 
<sang-froid>. For example, groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut 
River. This is in honor of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped 
a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in 
his own student days. And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated 
today. They are hailed by the nation's press, and Smith girls throng 
the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the <voyageurs> with 
hot soup and kisses.   Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic 
recreation is skiing. Since the days when their two thousand 
pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United 
States, the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team 
as another name for their own. Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant 
member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union, which includes the winter 
sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country.   Dartmouth 
students ski everywhere in winter, starting with their own front 
door. They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him, or move 
out to Oak Hill, where there's a lift. The Dartmouth Skiway, 
at Holt's Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the best 
terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.   Forty 
miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's own mountain. 
Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President Dickey acts as host every 
year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth 
Outing Club to life on the trails. The Lodge, built of hand-hewn 
virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining, sleeping, or 
lounging in its huge living room. The Outing Club also owns a chain 
of fourteen cabins and several shelters, extending from the Vermont 
hills, just across the river from the college, through Hanover to the 
College Grant- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in 
the logging country. The cabins are equipped with bunks, blankets, 
and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips. 
The club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of the students 
prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting, 
fishing, climbing, or skiing.   Under the auspices of the Outing 
Club, Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes 
on tough climbs like Mount McKinley, and Bait + Bullet, whose interests 
are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's Team, which 
competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and 
chopping, 
canoe races, and the like.   There is much to be said for a college 
that, while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives 
its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along 
back roads where a glimpse of small game, deer, or even bear is not 
uncommon. City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle 
or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly in a backwoods 
logging camp. And on the summit of Mount Washington, where thirty-five 
degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered 
higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of wisdom 
to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas "because 
it is there".   There is much to be said for such a college- 
and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too 
loudly. Their affection for their college home has even caused President 
Dickey to comment on this "place loyalty" as something rather 
specially Hanoverian.   Probably a lawyer once said it best for 
all time in the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in the 
nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about 
for a way to found its own state university. It fixed on Dartmouth College, 
which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered. The 
legislators decided to "liberate" Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war 
with the college trustees over the control of classrooms, faculty, 
and chapel. For a time there were two factions on the campus 
fighting for possession of the student body.   The struggle was 
resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing 
cases in our judicial history. In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating 
the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters. A lawyer, 
hired by the college, was arguing specifically for Dartmouth: 
Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made her plight the dramatic focus 
of his whole plea. In an age of oratory, he was the king of orators, 
and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly 
tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax:   "It
