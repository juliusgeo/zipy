wanted to be with him, to give him the comfort and companionship she 
knew he needed.   She had skipped her lunch hour in the fear that 
he might call while she was out. He hadn't. And now she was feeling 
sick, both from concern about Stanley and hunger.   Why hadn't 
he called?   Men, she reflected, even men like Stanley, 
are unpredictable.   She tried to think of his unpredictable 
actions in the eleven years she had known him and discovered they weren't 
so many after all.   Stanley really was quite predictable. 
That was one of the things she liked about Stanley. He wasn't like 
so many other men. The dentist last night, for instance. Dinner and 
the movies had been fine. He had taken her upstairs to say good night. 
She had invited him in for coffee.   It was in the kitchen, 
as she was watching the kettle, waiting for the water to boil, that 
he had grabbed for her. Without warning, without giving her a chance 
to prepare for it. From behind, he had put his arms on her shoulders, 
turned her around, and pressed her to him, so close she couldn't breathe.

Later, she apologized for the long scratch across his face, 
tried to explain she couldn't help herself, that the panic arose 
in her unwanted. But he hadn't understood. When he left, she knew 
she would never see him again.   Stanley wasn't like that. She 
could always predict what Stanley was going to do, ever since she 
first met him.   Except for that one morning. The morning he walked 
in to announce to her, blushing, that he was married. She thought 
she was going to die.   She had assumed before then that one 
day he would ask her to marry him.   Blanche couldn't remember 
when she had first arrived at this conclusion. She thought it was 
sometime during the second week she worked for Stanley. It was nothing 
that he said or did, but it seemed so <natural> to her that she 
should be working for him, looking forward to his eventual proposal.

She was thirty-one years old then. Her mother was already considerably 
concerned over her daughter's future. But Blanche had been 
able to maintain a serene and assured composure in the face of her widowed 
mother's continued carping, had been able to resist her urgings 
to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility of matrimony.

For Blanche, it was only a matter of time before Stanley would 
propose. It was to be expected that Stanley would be shy, slow in 
taking such a momentous step. Stanley went along in life, she knew, 
convinced that he deserved the love and faith of no woman. As a result, 
he never looked for it.   But one day, she expected, he would 
somehow discover, without her having to tell him, that there was such 
a woman in the world; a woman who was willing to give him love, faith, 
and anything else a woman could give a husband. Indeed, there was 
a woman who, unasked, had already given him love. Unquestionably, Blanche 
loved Stanley.   And then, unexpectedly, Stanley made his 
announcement.   On that first day, Blanche literally thought 
she was going to die, or, at the very least, go out of her mind.

It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker hadn't been 
everything that Blanche was not.   Kitti was thirty years younger 
than Stanley, taller than Stanley, prettier than Stanley had any 
right to hope for, much less expect. Kitti could have married a score 
of men. There was no reason for her to marry someone like Stanley 
Gilborn, there was no <need> for her to marry Stanley.   Kitti 
had come into the office, on somebody's recommendation, because she 
needed help in preparing her income tax return.   Stanley had 
filled out the return and because, when he was finished, it was close 
to the lunch hour, he had politely asked Kitti to join him, never expecting 
her to accept.   Blanche knew all this because the door 
to Stanley's office was open and, without straining too hard, she could 
hear everything that was said.   Stanley had gone out, saying 
he would be back in an hour. He hadn't come back for over two.

After that day, Blanche still didn't know exactly what had happened. 
There were mornings when Stanley came in late, afternoons when 
he left early, days when he didn't come in at all.   Blanche 
knew something must be causing Stanley's new, strange behavior but 
she never once connected it with Kitti Walker. It was too unprecedented. 
Then, six weeks after the day Kitti first came into the office, 
Stanley announced he and Kitti were married.   Somehow, Blanche 
managed to cover the stunned surprise and offer her congratulations.

That night the two of them left for a week's honeymoon 
in Acapulco.   While they were away Blanche came into the office 
every morning, running things as she had always run them for Stanley, 
going through the week in a dazed stupor, getting things done automatically, 
out of habit.   For exactly one week, she was able to 
continue in this manner.   On the morning of Stanley's return, 
however, her strength left her. Two hours of watching his serenely 
happy face, listening to his soft humming as he bent over his penciled 
figures, and Blanche had to leave.   She stayed away for ten 
days. Those ten days were like no others that Blanche had known.

Mostly, she stayed in bed. She didn't tell anyone, even her 
mother, what was wrong. She refused to have a doctor, insisting there 
was nothing a doctor could do for her.

"Right", said the fingerprint man. "Also, if you're going 
to believe those prints, you'll have to look for a killer who's 
a top-grade piano player".   He demonstrated by playing an 
imaginary piano, doing a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerated attack. 
To make it clearer he shifted to acting out, but with no change 
of manner, the killing of Rose Mallory. His hands snatched at an 
imaginary bucket, swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal 
snap like a ball that's been bounced hard. In the same way he 
pantomimed grasping a mantel and bouncing cleanly off that, pressing his 
hands against the floor and bouncing cleanly off that. He was moving 
like a ballet dancer, playing for laughs. If Rose Mallory's killer 
acted this way, catching up with him was going to be a cinch. We'd 
know him by his stretch pants and the flowers he'd wear twined 
in his hair.   Perhaps if Felix had first come upon us when this 
boy was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall outside the murdered 
woman's apartment, we might have had less trouble convincing Felix 
of our seriousness. This, you will remember, was still New Year's 
Day. By the time Felix turned up it was early afternoon, which, one 
would think, would be late enough so that by then, except for small children 
and a few hardy souls who had not yet sobered up, it could have 
been expected that people would no longer be having any sort of active 
interest in the previous night's noisemakers and paper hats.

Felix was the exception. He had retained his hat and his horn, 
and, 
whatever fun might still be going, he was ready to join it. That, incidentally, 
might give you some idea of what Felix was like. After 
all, he hadn't happened upon us in that second-floor hall without warning.

The ~ME's boys had finished their on-the-spot examination 
and the body had been removed for autopsy. The meat wagon, therefore, 
was not out in front of the house any more, but the cluster 
of squad cars was still there and there was a cop on the door downstairs 
to screen any comings and goings. There was, furthermore, the 
crowd of curious onlookers gathered in the street and a couple more cops 
to hold them at a decent distance.   Just put yourself in Felix's 
place for a moment. You're a taxpayer, householder, landlord. 
You've been away from home for the New Year festivities, but now 
the party is over and you come home. Defining sobriety in the limited 
sense of being free from the clinical symptoms of the effects of alcohol 
ingested and not yet eliminated from the system, you are sober.

You still have your paper hat and you're wearing it, but then, 
it is an extraordinary paper hat and, in addition to anything else 
you may be, you are also the sculptor who created that most peculiar dame 
out in the back yard. It's not too much to assume that you will 
have a more lasting interest in paper hats than will Mr& Average 
Citizen.   You have your paper horn clutched in your big, craggy 
fist, and for your entrance you have planned a noisy, colorful and exuberant 
greeting to your friends and tenants. You find your house a 
focus of public and police attention. Can you imagine yourself forgetting 
under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and 
unexpected situation so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper horn?

Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness. You shoulder 
your way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to 
the 
cop on the door. You identify yourself and ask him what's going 
on. Instead of answering you, he sticks his head in the door and shouts 
up the stairs.   "Got the upstairs guy", he bellows. "The 
owner. Do I send him up"? Then he turns back to you. "Go 
on in", he says. "They'll tell you what's cooking". 
Even then, as you go into the house oppressed by the knowledge that 
something is cooking and that your house has passed under this unaccountable, 
official control, could you go on forgetting that you still had 
that ridiculous hat on your head and you were still carrying that childish 
horn in your hand?   What I'm getting at is that we 
were fully prepared for Felix's being an odd one. We'd seen his 
handiwork out in the back yard, and the little his tenants had told us 
of him did make him sound a little special. We were not, however, prepared 
for anything like the apparition that confronted us as Felix came 
up the stairs. He, of course, must have been equally unprepared for 
what confronted him, but, nonetheless, I did find his reaction startling.

If Felix was still wearing the hat and carrying the horn 
because he'd forgotten about them, he now remembered. He came bounding 
up the stairs and joined the dance. He adjusted the hat, lifted 
the horn to his lips as though it were a flute, and fell in alongside 
our fingerprint expert to cavort with him.   Our man stopped 
dead and glowered at Felix. Felix threw his head back and laughed a 
laugh that shook the timbers of even that solidly built old house. This 
was a bull of a man. He was big-chested, big-shouldered and heavy-armed. 
His face was ruddy and heavy and unlined, and when he laughed 
he showed his teeth, which were big and white and strong and unquestionably 
home-grown. I don't remember ever seeing teeth that were quite 
so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures. His 
hair had receded most of the way to the back of his neck. He had only 
a fringe of hair and he wore it cropped short. It was almost as white 
as his teeth. For a man of his mass he was curiously short. He 
wasn't a dwarf but he was a bit of a comic figure. A man with so big 
and so staggeringly developed a torso and such long and powerful arms 
is expected to stand taller than five feet five. For Felix it was 
a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement. The man was just this 
side of being a freak.   We waited till he had finished laughing, 
and that gave us a few moments for taking stock of him. He was dressed 
in a manner <Esquire> might suggest for the outdoor man's 
country weekend. Dark gray sports jacket, lighter gray slacks, pink flannel 
shirt, black silk necktie. His eyes were clear. He was freshly 
shaved, and if there had been any alcohol in him we could never have 
missed detecting some scent of it on the massive gusts of his laughter. 
Not even a whiff. Eventually he subsided.   "Felix"? 
Gibby said.   "Me", he said merrily. "Me, the happy one".

"That much Latin we remember", Gibby said dryly. "You 
always live up to your name, always like this, always making happy"?

"I try", Felix said blithely. "The world is full 
of blokes who put their hearts into making the tragic scene. I've 
never noticed that it improves things any".   "Bully for you", 
Gibby said. "What's the rest of your name"?   "No 
rest of it. Felix is all there is".   "All there ever
