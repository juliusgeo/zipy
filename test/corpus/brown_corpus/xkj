capital expansion programs of business firms involve multi-year budgeting 
and the same is true of country development programs. _(B) THE NEED 
TO PLAN INVESTMENT PROGRAMS._ More importantly, several of 
the more advanced of the less developed countries have found through 
experience that they must plan their own complex investment programs for 
at least 5 years forward and tentatively for considerably more than 
that if they are to be sure that the various interdependent activities 
involved are all to take place in the proper sequence. Without such 
forward planning, investment funds are wasted because manufacturing facilities 
are completed before there is power to operate them or before 
there is transport to service them; or a skilled labor force is trained 
before there are plants available in which they can be employed. 
_(C) THE NEED TO ALLOCATE COUNTRY RESOURCES._ Most important 
of all, the less developed countries must be persuaded to take the necessary 
steps to allocate and commit their own resources. They must 
be induced to establish the necessary tax, fiscal, monetary, and regulatory 
policies. They must be persuaded to adopt the other necessary self-help 
measures which are described in the preceding section. The taking 
of these steps involves tough internal policy decisions. Moreover, 
once these steps are taken, they may require years to make themselves 
felt. They must, therefore, be related to long-range development 
plans. _3. PROVIDING AN INCENTIVE_ If the less developed countries 
are to be persuaded to adopt a long-term approach, the United States, 
as the principal supplier of external aid, must be prepared to give 
long-term commitments. In this, as in so many aspects of our development 
assistance activities, the incentive effects of the posture we take 
are the most important ones. The extent to which we can persuade 
the less developed countries to appraise their own resources, to set targets 
toward which they should be working, to establish in the light 
of this forward 
perspective the most urgent priorities for their immediate 
attention, and to do the other things which they must do to help themselves, 
all on a realistic long-term basis, will depend importantly 
on the incentives we place before them. If they feel that we are taking 
a long-term view of their problems and are prepared to enter into 
reasonably long-term association with them in their development activities, 
they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult tasks required. 
Perhaps the most important incentive for them will be clear 
evidence that where other countries have done this kind of home work we 
have responded with long-term commitments.

You have heard him tell these young people that during his almost 
50 years of service in the Congress he has seen the Kaisers and 
the Hitlers and the Mussolinis, the Tojos and Stalins and Khrushchevs, 
come and go and that we are passing on to them the freest Nation 
that mankind has ever known. Then I have seen the pride of country 
well in the eyes of these young people.   So, I say, Mr& Speaker, 
God bless you and keep you for many years not only for this body 
but for the United States of America and the free world. You remember 
the words of President Kennedy a week or so ago, when someone 
asked him when he was in Canada, and Dean Rusk was in Europe, and 
Vice President JOHNSON was in Asia, "Who is running the 
store"? and he said "The same fellow who has been running it, SAM 
RAYBURN". 

#GENERAL LEAVE TO EXTEND#

_MR& MCCORMACK._ 
Mr& Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members who desire 
to do so may extend their remarks at this point in the RECORD; 
and also that they may have 5 legislative days in which to extend 
their remarks. _THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE._ Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was 
no objection. 

#REMARKS OF HON& JOSEPH P& ADDABBO OF NEW YORK# 

_MR& ADDABBO._ It is notably significant that so many Members 
from both sides of the aisle express their respect and admiration for 
our beloved Speaker, the Honorable SAM RAYBURN. I purposely 
refrained from adding the usual distinction of saying that he was from 
the State of Texas. I did so because I agree with so many here 
today, that he is the beloved Speaker of all the people of the United 
States. For the dignity, the influence, and the power of the legislative 
branch of our Government- it is a privilege for us to do honor 
to this great man who represents not alone his own district but all 
the people of our country. To honor him is to honor ourselves.

In this my first year as a Member of this body I have experienced 
many memorable moments. Many of these experiences are so important 
that they will be cherished forever by me. And, like many of you here 
present, I hold as the highlight of all, the occasion of my first meeting 
with the honorable Speaker of the House. At that time, he afforded 
me the courtesy of his busy workday for such length as I may need, 
to speak about my background, my hopes, my views on various national 
and local topics, and any problems that I may have been vexed with 
at the time. He was fatherly in his handling of all subjects with me 
and tremendously wise in his counsel. In conclusion, he wished me well- 
and as kindly and humbly as this humane gentleman could express 
himself, he asked to be remembered to my wife and children.   In 
my short period here I believe that at no time has he been otherwise 
than the most popular man on both sides of the aisle. He is most effective 
in the ordinary business of the House, and in the legislative 
accomplishments of this session, he easily rose to great occasion- even 
at the height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle- 
and as the Nation witnessed these contests, he rose, even as admitted 
by those who differed with him, to the proportions of a hero and a 
noble partisan.   I am highly privileged today to commemorate the 
brilliant career of this parliamentary giant. He will ever be my example 
as a true statesman; one who is thoroughly human, who affects 
no dignity, and who is endowed with real ability, genuine worth, and 
sterling honesty- all dedicated to secure the best interests of the 
country he has loved and served so long. May the Divine Speaker in 
Heaven bless this country with SAM RAYBURN'S continued service 
here for years to come. 

#REMARKS OF HON& WAYNE L& HAYS OF OHIO# 

_MR& HAYS._ It is a matter of deep personal satisfaction for 
me to add my voice to the great and distinguished chorus of my colleagues 
in this paean of praise, respect, and affection for Speaker SAM 
RAYBURN. In this hour of crisis, the wisdom, the dedication, the 
stabilizing force that he represents in current American government 
is an almost indispensable source of strength. He has become in this 
half century the grand old man of American history. It seems to me 
that the prayers of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition 
to Providence that SAM RAYBURN'S vigor and his life remain 
undiminished through the coming decades.   Here briefly in this 
humble tribute I have sought for some simple and succinct summation 
that would define the immense service of this patriot to his country. 
But the task is beyond me because I hold it impossible to compress 
in a sentence or two the complicated and prodigious contributions SAM 
RAYBURN has made as an individual, as a legislator, as a statesman 
and as a leader and conciliator, to the majestic progress of this 
Nation. It happens that I am a legislator from Ohio and that I feel 
deeply about the needs, the aspirations, the interests of my district 
and my State. What SAM RAYBURN'S life proves to us all is 
the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and 
with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interests 
of one's own community, one's own district, one's own State, 
and by that help himself represent even better the sweep and scope of 
the problems of this the greatest nation of all time.   For SAM 
RAYBURN never forgot Bonham, his home community, and he never 
forgot Texas. In the same way I like to think we owe our loyalty as 
legislators to our community, our district, our State. And, if we 
follow the RAYBURN pattern, as consciously or by an instinctual 
political sense I like to think I have followed it, then the very nature 
of our loyalty to our own immediate areas must necessarily be reflected 
in the devotion of our services to our country. For what SAM 
RAYBURN'S life in this House teaches us is that loyalty and character 
are not divisive and there is no such thing as being for your 
country and neglecting your district. There is no such thing as being 
diligent about national affairs but indifferent about home needs. The 
two are as one. This may not be the greatest but it certainly comes 
close to being the greatest lesson SAM RAYBURN'S career, up to 
this hour, teaches all of us who would aspire to distinction in political 
life under our processes of government.   More than that, 
SAM RAYBURN is the very living symbol of an iron-clad integrity 
so powerful in his nature and so constantly demonstrated that he can count 
some of his best friends in the opposition. Through the most rancorous 
battles of political controversy and the most bitterly fought national 
and presidential campaigns his character shines as an example 
of dignity and honesty, forthrightness and nobility. SAM RAYBURN 
has never had to look back at any of his most devastating fights and 
ever feel ashamed of his conduct as a combatant under fire or his political 
manners in the heat of conflicting ambitions. This means much to 
the American tradition. It is an answer in its way, individual and 
highly dramatic, to the charge that the democratic process is necessarily 
vicious in its campaign characteristics. And the name RAYBURN 
is one of the most dominant in the history of American politics for 
the last half century.   It is, I insist, hard to define the 
RAYBURN contribution to our political civilization because it is 
so massive and so widespread and so complicated, and because it goes 
so deep. But this we know: Here is a great life that in every area 
of American politics gives the American people occasion for pride 
and that has invested the democratic process with the most decent qualities 
of honor, decency, and self-respect. I pray to God that he may 
be spared to us for many years to come for this is an influence the United 
States and the whole world can ill afford to lose. 

#REMARKS 
OF HON& MELVIN PRICE OF ILLINOIS#

_MR& PRICE._ All but two 
of my nine terms in the House of Representatives has been served under 
the Speakership of SAM RAYBURN. Of this I am proud. I have 
a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility 
with which he carries his greatness.   And SAM RAYBURN 
is a great man- one who will go down in American history as a truly 
great leader of the Nation. He will be considered not only great 
among his contemporaries, but as great among all the Americans who 
have played a part in the country's history since the beginning.

I pay my personal tribute to SAM RAYBURN, stalwart Texan and 
great American, not only because today he establishes a record of 
having served as Speaker of the House of Representatives more than 
twice as long as Henry Clay, but because of the contributions he has 
made to the welfare of the people of the Nation during his almost half 
century of service as a Member of Congress.   Speaker RAYBURN 
has not limited his leadership as a statesman to his direction 
of the House in the Speaker's chair. He had an outstanding record 
as a legislator since the start of his career in the House in 1913, 
the 63d Congress. No one has sponsored more progressive and important 
legislation than has SAM RAYBURN. He is the recognized "father" 
of the Rural Electrification Administration and the Security 
and Exchange Commission. But to run the gauntlet of the programs 
SAM RAYBURN brought into being through his legislative efforts 
would fill the pages of today's Record.   No greater pleasure 
has come to me in my own service in this House than to be present 
today to participate in this tribute to this great Speaker, this great
