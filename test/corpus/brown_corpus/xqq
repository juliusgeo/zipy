comforting, even though Mercer did not make much sense out of it.

Thus events occurred, and victims changed in appearance, and 
new ones arrived. Sometimes B'dikkat took the new ones, resting in 
the everlasting sleep of their burned-out brains, in a ground-truck 
to be added to other herds. The bodies in the truck threshed and bawled 
without human speech when the dromozoa struck them.   Finally, 
Mercer did manage to follow B'dikkat to the door of the cabin. He 
had to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it. Only the memory 
of previous hurt, bewilderment and perplexity made him sure that if 
he did not ask B'dikkat when he, Mercer, was happy, the answer would 
no longer be available when he needed it. Fighting pleasure itself, 
he begged B'dikkat to check the records and to tell him how long 
he had been there.   B'dikkat grudgingly agreed, but he did not 
come out of the doorway. He spoke through the public address box built 
into the cabin, and his gigantic voice roared out over the empty plain, 
so that the pink herd of talking people stirred gently in their 
happiness and wondered what their friend B'dikkat might be wanting 
to tell them. When he said it, they thought it exceedingly profound, 
though none of them understood it, since it was simply the amount of time 
that Mercer had been on Shayol:   "Standard years- eighty-four 
years, seven months, three days, two hours, eleven and one 
half minutes. Good luck, fellow".   Mercer turned away.

The secret little corner of his mind, which stayed sane through happiness 
and pain, made him wonder about B'dikkat. What persuaded the 
cow-man to remain on Shayol? What kept him happy without super-condamine? 
Was B'dikkat a crazy slave to his own duty or was he a 
man who had hopes of going back to his own planet some day, surrounded 
by a family of little cow-people resembling himself? Mercer, despite 
his happiness, wept a little at the strange fate of B'dikkat. His 
own fate he accepted.   He remembered the last time he had eaten- 
actual eggs from an actual pan. The dromozoa kept him alive, 
but he did not know how they did it.   He staggered back to the 
group. The Lady Da, naked in the dusty plain, waved a hospitable hand 
and showed that there was a place for him to sit beside her. There 
were unclaimed square miles of seating space around them, but he appreciated 
the kindliness of her gesture none the less. #/4,# 

The years, if they were years, went by. The land of Shayol did not 
change.   Sometimes the bubbling sound of geysers came faintly across 
the plain to the herd of men; those who could talk declared it 
to be the breathing of Captain Alvarez. There was night and day, but 
no setting of crops, no change of 
season, no generations of men. Time 
stood still for these people, and their load of pleasure was so commingled 
with the shocks and pains of the dromozoa that the words of the 
Lady Da took on very remote meaning.   "People never live forever".

Her statement was a hope, not a truth in which they 
could believe. They did not have the wit to follow the stars in their 
courses, to exchange names with each other, to harvest the experience 
of each for the wisdom of all. There was no dream of escape for these 
people. Though they saw the old-style chemical rockets lift up from 
the field beyond B'dikkat's cabin, they did not make plans to hide 
among the frozen crop of transmuted flesh.   Far long ago, some 
other prisoner than one of these had tried to write a letter. His 
handwriting was on a rock. Mercer read it, and so had a few of the others, 
but they could not tell which man had done it. Nor did they care.

The letter, scraped on stone, had been a message home. They 
could still read the opening: "Once, I was like you, stepping 
out of my window at the end of day, and letting the winds blow me gently 
toward the place I lived in. Once, like you, I had one head, two 
hands, ten fingers on my hands. The front part of my head was called 
a face, and I could talk with it. Now I can only write, and that only 
when I get out of pain.

DAN MORGAN TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD FORGET Ann Turner. He 
was well rid of her. He certainly didn't want a wife who was fickle 
as Ann. If he had married her, he'd have been asking for trouble.

But all of this was rationalization. Sometimes he woke up in 
the middle of the night thinking of Ann, and then could not get back 
to sleep. His plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for 
so long that now he felt as if he had nothing. The easiest thing would 
be to sell out to Al Budd and leave the country, but there was 
a stubborn streak in him that wouldn't allow it.   The best antidote 
for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard 
work. He found that if he was tired enough at night, he went to sleep 
simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake. Each day he found 
himself thinking less often of Ann; each day the hurt was a little 
duller, a little less poignant.   He had plenty of work to do. 
Because the summer was unusually dry and hot, the spring produced a 
smaller stream than in ordinary years. The grass in the meadows came 
fast, now that the warm weather was here. He could not afford to lose 
a drop of the precious water, so he spent most of his waking hours along 
the ditches in his meadows.   He had no idea how much time 
Budd would give him. In any case, he had no intention of being caught 
asleep, so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he 
took his Winchester with him and leaned it against the fence. He stopped 
every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon, 
but nothing happened, each day dragging out with monotonous calm.

When, in late afternoon on the last day in June, he saw two 
people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house, he quit work 
immediately and strode to his rifle. It could be some kind of trick 
Budd had thought up. No one walked in this country, least of all 
Ed Dow or Dutch Renfro or any of the rest of the Bar ~B crew. 
Morgan watched the two figures for a time, puzzled. When they were closer 
and he saw that one was a woman, he was more puzzled than ever.

He cleaned his shovel, left it against the fence, picked up his 
Winchester, and started downstream. His visitors had crawled through 
the south fence and were crossing the meadow, angling toward the house. 
Now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly, 
staggering, as if they found it a struggle to remain on their 
feet.   Reaching the house ahead of them, he waited with his 
Winchester in his hands. They crawled through the north fence and came 
on toward him, and now he saw that both were young, not more than nineteen 
or twenty. They were dirty, their clothes were torn, and the 
girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from 
the front door. She lay there, making no effort to get back on her 
feet. The boy came on to the porch and sat down, his gaze on Morgan 
as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring.   Morgan 
hesitated, thinking that if this was a trick, it was a good one. He 
didn't think it was possible for this couple to be pretending. The 
boy licked his dry lips. He asked, "Could we have a drink"?

Morgan jerked his head toward the front door. "In the kitchen", 
he said. Leaning his Winchester against the front of the house, 
he walked to the girl. "Get up. There's water in the house".

She didn't move or say anything. Her eyes were glazed as if 
she didn't hear or even see him. She had reached a point at which 
she didn't even care how she looked. Her face was very thin, and burned 
by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling, the new 
skin under it red and angry.   Her blond hair was frowzy, her dress 
torn in several places, and her shoes were so completely worn out 
that they were practically no protection. It must have hurt her even 
to walk, for the sole was completely off her left foot and Morgan saw 
that it was bruised and bleeding.   He picked her up, sliding one 
hand under her shoulders, the other under her knees, and carried her 
into the house. She was amazingly light, and so relaxed in his arms 
that he wasn't even sure she was conscious. Any lingering suspicion 
that this was a trick Al Budd had thought up was dispelled. No girl 
would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him. Besides, she 
had a sweet face that attracted him.   He put her down on the 
couch, and going into the kitchen, saw that the boy had dropped into a 
chair beside the table. They looked a good deal alike, Morgan thought. 
Both had blonde hair and blue eyes, and there was even a faint similarity 
of features.   Morgan filled the dipper from the water 
bucket on the shelf, went back into the front room, lifted the girl's 
head, and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth. She drank greedily, 
and murmured, "Thank you", as he lowered her head.   He 
stood looking down at her for a moment, wondering what could have reduced 
her to this condition. He had seen a few nester wagons go through 
the country, the families almost starving to death, but he had never 
seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two.   The girl 
dropped off to sleep. Morgan returned to the kitchen, built a fire, 
and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured 
into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove. He brought 
his Winchester in from the front of the house, then faced the boy.

"Who are you and what happened to you"? he asked. 
"I'm Billy Jones", the boy answered. "That's my wife Sharon. 
We ran out of money and we haven't eaten for two days".

"What are you doing here"?   "Are we in Wyoming"?

Morgan nodded. "About five miles north of the line".

Jones sighed as if relieved. "We've been looking for work, 
but all the ranchers have turned us down".   "You mean you 
dragged your wife all over hell's half-acre looking for work"? 
Morgan demanded. "The town of Buckhorn's only about six miles 
from here. Why didn't you go there"?   "We didn't want 
town work", Jones said.   "This is a mighty empty country", 
Morgan said. "There's only one more ranch three miles north 
of here. You'd have starved to death if you'd missed both places".

"Then we're lucky we got here. Could you give us a 
job, Mr& **h"   "Morgan. Dan Morgan".   He was 
silent a moment, thinking he could use a man this time of year, and if 
the girl could cook, it would give him more time in the meadows, but 
he knew nothing about the couple. They might kill him in his sleep, thinking 
there was money in the house. He dismissed the possibility at 
once. The girl's thin face haunted him. It wasn't the face of a 
killer. He wasn't so sure about the boy. He hadn't shaved for several 
weeks, his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic, woebegone expression.

There was more to this than Jones had told him. They 
were running from something. He'd be an idiot to let them stay 
he thought, but he couldn't send them on, either.   "I could 
use some help", Morgan said finally, "but I can't afford to pay 
you anything. I guess you'd better go on in the morning". 
"We'll work for our keep", the boy said eagerly. "I've been 
mucking in a mine in the San Juan, but I used to work on a ranch. 
Sharon, she's cooked in a restaurant. We'll work hard, Mr& Morgan".

"I'll see", Morgan said. "Right now you need 
a meal and a bath. Your wife's in terrible shape".   "I 
know", Jones said dejectedly.   Morgan filled the fire box 
with wood again, then started supper and set the table. When the meal 
was ready, he told Jones to wash up, and going into the front room, 
woke the girl. He said, "I've got some supper ready".   She 
rubbed her eyes and stretched, then sat up, her hands going to her 
hair. "I'm a mess", she said, and suddenly she was alarmed. "Who 
are you? How did we get here"?   "I'm Dan Morgan. 
This is the Rafter ~M. You fell down in front of the house,
