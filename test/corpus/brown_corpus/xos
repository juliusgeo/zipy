
The stage had been empty, except for Harry Hawk, doing his star 
monologue. The audience was fond of Harry Hawk, he was a dear, 
in or out of character, but he was not particularly funny. At the end 
of the monologue the audience would applaud. Meanwhile it looked at 
the scenery.   "Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside 
out, you sockdologizing old mantrap"! said Trenchard, otherwise 
Hawk. There was always a pause here, before the next line. 
That was when the gun went off. Yet even that explosion did not mean 
much. Guns were going off all over Washington City these days, because 
of the celebrations, and the theatre was not soundproof.   Then 
the audience saw a small, dim figure appear at the edge of the Presidential 
box. "<Sic semper tyrannis>", it said mildly. Booth 
had delivered his line. Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud 
of smoke.   They strained forward. They had not heard what had 
been said. They had been sitting too long to be able to stand up easily. 
The figure leapt from the box, almost lost its balance, the flag 
draped there tore in the air, the figure landed on its left leg, fell 
on its hands, and pressed itself up.   Harry Hawk still had his 
arm raised towards the wings. His speech faltered. He did not lower 
his arm.   The figure was so theatrically dressed, that it was 
as though 
a character from some other play had blundered into this one. The 
play for Saturday night was to be a benefit performance of <The Octoroon>. 
This figure looked like the slave dealer from that. But it 
also looked like a toad, hopping away from the light. There was something 
maimed and crazy about its motion that disturbed them.   Then 
it disappeared into the wings.   Harry Hawk had not shifted 
position, but he at last lowered his arm.   Mrs& Lincoln screamed. 
There was no mistaking that scream. It was what anyone who had ever 
seen her had always expected her to do. Yet this scream had a different 
note in it. That absence of an urgent self-indulgence dashed them 
awake like a pail of water.   Clara Harris, one of the guests 
in the box, stood up and demanded water. Her action was involuntary. 
When something unexpected happened, one always asked for water if 
one were a woman, brandy if one were a man.   Mrs& lincoln screamed 
again.   In the Presidential box someone leaned over the 
balustrade and yelled: "He has shot the President"!   That 
got everybody up. On the stage, Harry Hawk began to weep. Laura 
Keene 
brushed by him with the glass of water. The crowd began to move. 
In Washington City everyone lived in a bubble of plots, and one death 
might attract another. It was not exactly panic they gave way to, 
but they could not just sit there. The beehive voices, for no one could 
bear silence, drowned out the sound of Mrs& Lincoln's weeping.

At the rear of the auditorium, upstairs, some men tried to 
push open the door to the box corridor. It would not give.   A 
Dr& Charles Taft clambered up on the stage and got the actors to 
hoist him up to the box. In the audience a man named Ferguson lost 
his head and tried to rescue a little girl from the mob, on the same principle 
which had led Miss Harris to demand water.   Someone 
opened the corridor door from the inside, and called for a doctor. Somehow 
Dr& Charles Leale was forced through the mob and squeezed out 
into the dingy corridor. He went straight to the Presidential box.

As usual, Mrs& Lincoln had lost her head, but nobody blamed 
her for doing so now. There was a little blood on the hem of her dress, 
for the assassin had slashed Miss Harris's companion, Major 
Rathbone, with a knife. Rathbone said he was bleeding to death. By 
the look of him he wasn't that far gone. 
With a sneer, the man spread his legs and, a third time, confronted them.

Once more, Katie reared, and whinnied in fear. For a moment, 
boy and mount hung in midair. Stevie twisted and, frantically, 
commanded the mare to leap straight ahead. But the stranger was nimbler 
still. With a bold arm, he dared once more to obstruct them. Katie 
reared a third time, then, trembling, descended.   The stranger 
leered. Seizing the bridle, he tugged with all his might and forced 
Katie to her knees. It was absurd. Stevie could feel himself toppling. 
He saw the ground coming up- and the stranger's head. With 
incredible ferocity, he brought his fists together and struck. The blow 
encountered silky hair and hard bone. The man uttered a weird cry, 
spun about, and collapsed in the sand.   Katie scrambled to her 
feet, Stevie agilely retaining his seat. Again Katie reared, and now, 
wickedly, he compelled her to bring her hooves down again and again 
upon the sprawled figure of the stranger. He could feel his own feet, 
iron-shod, striking repeatedly until the body was limp. He gloated, 
and his lips slavered. He heard himself chortling.   They rode 
around and around to trample the figure into the sand. Only the top 
of the head, with a spot bare and white as a clamshell, remained visible. 
Stevie was shouting triumphantly.   A train hooted. Instantly, 
he chilled. They were pursuing him. He was frightened; his fists 
clutched so tightly that his knuckles hurt. Then Katie stumbled, 
and again he was falling, falling!   "Stevie! Stevie"!

His mother was nudging him, but he was still falling. His head hung 
over the boards of Katie's stall; before it was sprawled the 
mangled corpse of the bearded stranger.   "Stevie, wake up now! 
We're nearly there".   He had been dreaming. He was safe 
in his Mama's arms.   The train had slowed. Houses winked 
as the cars rolled beside a little depot. "Po' Chavis"! the 
trainman 
called. He came by and repeated, "Po' Chavis"!

<Bong! Bong!> startled him awake. The room vibrated as 
if a giant hand had rocked it. <Bong!> a dull boom and a throbbing 
echo. The walls bulged, the floor trembled, the windowpanes rattled. 
He stared at the far morning, expecting a pendulum to swing across the 
horizon. <Bong!> He raced to the window and yanked at the sash. 
<Bong!> the wood was old, the paint alligatored. <Bong!> A 
fresh breeze saluted him. <Six> o'clock!   He put his his 
head out. There was the slate roof of the church; ivy climbed the 
red brick walls like a green-scaled monster. The clock which had struck 
presented an innocent face.   In the kitchen Mama was wiping 
the cupboards.   "There's a tower and a steeple on the church 
a million feet high. And the loudest clock in the whole world"!

"I know, Stephen", she smiled. "They say that our 
steeple is one hundred and sixty-two feet high. The clock you heard strike- 
it's really the town clock- was installed last April by 
Mrs& Shorter, on her birthday".   He dressed, and sped outdoors. 
He crossed Broome Street to Orange Square. The steeple leaned 
backward, while the church advanced like a headless creature in a 
long, shapeless coat. The spire seemed to hold up the sky.   Port 
Jervis, basking in the foothills, was the city of God. The Dutch 
Reformed Church, with two steeples and its own school was on Main 
Street; the Episcopal Church was one block down Sussex Street; 
the Catholic Saint Mary's Church, with an even taller steeple 
and a cross on top, stood on Ball Street. The Catholics had the 
largest cemetery, near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south; 
Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds.   God 
was everywhere, in the belfry, in the steeple, in the clouds, in the 
trees, and in the mountains hulking on the horizon. Somewhere, beyond, 
where shadows lurked, must be the yawning pit of which Papa preached 
and the dreadful Lake of Fire.   So, walking in awe, he became 
familiar with God, who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church 
with its high steeple and clock. There was no church like Drew Church, 
no preacher like Papa, who was intimate with Him, and could consign 
sinners to hellfire. To know God he must follow in Papa's 
footsteps. He was fortunate, and proud.   The veterans, idling 
on their benches in the Square, beneath the soldiers' monument, got 
to 
their feet when Papa approached: "Morning, Reverend"! His 
being and His will- Stevie could not divide God from his Papa- 
illumined every parish face, turned the choir into a band of angels, 
and the pulpit into the tollgate to Heaven.   "We have nine 
hundred and eleven members in our charge", Mama announced, "and three 
hundred and eighty Sunday-school scholars".   When Papa 
went out to do God's work, Stevie often accompanied him in the buggy, 
which was drawn by Violet, the new black mare. Although they journeyed 
westerly as far as Germantown, beyond the Erie roundhouse and 
the machine shop, and along the Delaware and Hudson Canal, and northward 
to Brooklyn, below Point Peter, he could see the church spire 
wherever he looked back. Sometimes they went south and rolled past 
the tollhouse- "Afternoon, Reverend"!- and crossed the suspension 
bridge to Matamoras; that was Pennsylvania.   In the 
Delaware River, three long islands were overgrown with greening trees 
and underbrush. South of Laurel Grove Cemetery, and below the 
junction of the Neversink and the Delaware, was the Tri-State Rock, 
from which Stevie could spy New Jersey and Pennsylvania, as well 
as New York, simply by spinning around on his heel.   On these 
excursions, Papa instructed him on man's chief end, which was his 
duty to God and his own salvation. However, a boy's lively eyes might 
rove. Where Cuddleback Brook purled into the Neversink was a magnificent 
swimming hole. Papa pointed a scornful finger at the splashing 
youth: "Idle recreation"! Stevie saw no idols; it troubled 
him that he couldn't always see what Papa saw. He was torn between 
the excitement in the sun-inflamed waters and a little engine chugging 
northward on the Monticello Branch.   "Where you been 
today"? Ludie inquired every evening, pretending that he did not 
care. "He'll make a preacher out of you"!   "No, he 
won't"! Stevie flared. "Not me"!   "Somebody's 
got to be a preacher in the family. He made a will and last testament 
before we left Paterson. I heard them! Uncle and Aunt Howe were 
the witnesses".   "Will he die"?   "Everybody 
does".   Ludie could be hateful. To speak of Papa dying was 
a sin. It could never happen as long as God was alert and the Drew 
steeple stood guard with its peaked lance.   Stevie was constantly 
slipping into the church. He pulled with all his strength at the 
heavy, brass-bound door, and shuffled along the wainscoted wall. The 
cold, mysterious presence of God was all around him. At the end of a 
shaft of light, the pews appeared to be broad stairs in a long dungeon. 
Far away, standing before a curtained window in the study room, was 
his father, hands tucked under his coattails, and staring into the dark 
church. The figure was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence.

The boy shuddered at the deathly pale countenance with its wrinkles 
and gray hair. Would Papa really die? The mouth was thin-lipped 
and wide, the long cleft in the upper lip like a slide. When Papa's 
slender fingers removed the spectacles, there were red indentations 
on the bridge of the strong nose.   "It's time you began 
to think on God, Stephen. Perhaps one day He will choose you as 
He chose me, long ago. Therefore, give Him your affection and store 
up His love for you. Open your heart to Him and pray, Stephen, pray! 
For His mercy and His guidance to spare you from evil and eternal 
punishment in the Lake of Fire".   Stevie had heard these 
words many times, yet on each occasion they caused him to tremble. 
For he feared the Lake of Fire. He strove to think of God and His 
eternal wrath; he must pray to be spared.   Papa was disappointed 
that none of the brothers had heard the Call. Not George, Townley, 
or Ted, certainly not Ludie. Burt was at Hackettstown and 
Will at Albany Law School, where they surely could not hear it. Someday 
God would choose <him>. He would hear the Call and would run 
to tell Papa. The stern face would relax, the black-clad arms would 
embrace him, "My son"! Yet how might he know the Call when 
it came? Probably, as in Scriptures, a still, small voice would whisper.
