
#TOTAL DISINTEREST#

"As the mother of an autistic 
child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything, 
I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he 
first 
plays with a new toy. He wants me to do everything for him.   "You 
don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of 
something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats 
them. But I do and my psychiatrist does, too. I know, that my 
son wants control and direction, but being autistic myself I cannot give 
full control or direction.   "One thing I notice which I 
have seldom heard mentioned. This is that autistic people don't enjoy 
physical contact with others- for instance, my children and I. 
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is 
as straight and stiff as a board. He pushes and straightens himself 
as if he can't stand the feeling of being held. Physical contact is 
uncomforatble for him"!   This mother is quite correct. As 
a rule, the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others. 
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him. For the young 
child this may be no more than providing food, light or movement. As 
he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object 
(his "magic" thing). Or certain words or rituals that child and 
adult go through may do the trick. The answer is different for each autistic 
child, but for most there is an answer. Only ingenuity will uncover 
it. 

#WHAT FUTURE HOLDS#

"Dear Doctors: We learned this 
year that our older son, Daniel, is autistic. We did not accept the 
diagnosis at once, but gradually we are coming to. Fortunately, there 
is a nursery school which he has been able to attend, with a group 
of normal children.   "I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal, 
though of course I realize he is far from that at present. What 
I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible. 
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible.

"What is your experience with autistic children? How do they 
turn out later"?   Many autistic children grow up to lead 
relatively normal lives. Certainly, most continue to lack a certain warmth 
in communication with other people, but many adjust to school, even 
college, to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood. 

#SINGLE-COLOR 
USE# 


_QUESTION_- <A first grader colors pictures one solid color, 
everything- sky, grass, boy, wagon, etc&. When different colors 
are used, she is just as likely to color trees purple, hair green, 
etc&>.   <The other children in the class use this same coloring 
book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color. Should 
I show my daughter how things should be colored? She is an aggressive, 
nervous child. Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help 
her outgrow these traits?> _ANSWER_- Her choice of one color 
means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring, without having 
reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects. 
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature 
for the first grade.   No, coloring isn't exactly something 
you teach a child. You sometimes give them a little demonstration, 
a little guidance, and suggestions about staying inside the lines. But 
most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only 
a very little demonstration.

SEEN in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest 
in an old art: embroidery. Possibly responsible for this is the incoming 
trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms, which seems slated to 
replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed. Just as 
a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme, 
so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.   One such, 
in fact, is a rug. Though not actually crewel embroidery, it has 
that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue, pink, bronze 
and gold and a sauterne background. The twirled, stylized design of 
winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns 
used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in 
England.   Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing 
more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available 
in this country. The work is executed in England (by hand) and 
can be worked in any desired design and color.   Among some recent 
imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on 
which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens 
and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color. 

#CHINESE INFLUENCE#

For a particularly fabulous room which houses 
a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture, fabric wall panels 
were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this 
revered Eighteenth Century period. Since the work is done by hand, 
the only limitation, it is said, "is that of human conception".

Modern embroidered panels, framed and meant to be hung on the 
wall, are another aspect of this trend. These have never gone out of 
style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and 
there in shops which specialize in handicrafts. An amateur decorator 
might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings, and, by 
picking up her living room color scheme, add a decorative do-it-yourself 
note to the room.

California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 
model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling 
in a thousand district headquarters, party clubrooms and workers' 
backyards.   They seem darned proud of it.   And they're 
confident that the ~GOP, currently assailed by dissensions 
within the ranks, will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood 
of this grassroots-fueled machine. #@#

Their meeting at San 
Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California 
Democratic Council directorate. But it will include 200-odd officeholders, 
organization leaders and "interested party people".

Out of this session may come: _1_- Plans for a dramatic, 
broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist 
top-drawer Democrats from all over the country. _2_- Blueprints 
for doubling the ~CDC's present 55,000 enrollment. _3_- 
Arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in 
Fresno next Jan& 26-28. _4_- And proposals for a whole series 
of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional 
districts.   At the head of the ~CDC is an unorthodox, 
39-year-old amateur politico, Thomas B& Carvey Jr&, 
whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon 
missiles. He's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering 
fashion. #@#

Viewed from afar, the ~CDC looks like 
a rather stalwart political pyramid: its elected directorate fans out 
into an array of district leaders and standing committees, and thence 
into its component clubs and affiliated groups- 500 or so. 
Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every 
"volunteer" Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to 
the ~CDC. #@#

Moreover, the entire state Democratic hierarchy, 
from Gov& Brown on down to the county chairmen, also participates 
in this huge operation.   Contrarily, Republican "volunteers" 
go their separate ways, and thus far have given no indication 
that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate, 
except in the most loose-knit fashion.   Carvey believes that 
reapportionment, 
which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district 
boundaries, actually will increase ~CDC membership. Where 
only one club existed before, he says, two will flourish henceforth.

Biggest organizational problem, he adds, is setting up ~CDC 
units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory. Paradoxically the council 
is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's 
favor, strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly 
even basis.   Like most Democratic spokesmen, Carvey predicts 
1962 will be a tremendously "partisan year". Hence the attention 
they're lavishing on the ~CDC.   In all probability, the 
council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for 
Congress, and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary 
favorites. This bodes heated contests in several districts where 
claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't 
see eye-to-eye with the ~CDC.   Naturally, the statewide 
races will provide the major test for the expanding council.   Shunted 
aside by the rampant organizers for John F& Kennedy last 
year, who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential 
campaign, the ~CDC plainly intends to provide the party's 
campaign muscle in 1962. There is evidence that it will be happily received 
by Gov& Brown and the other constitutional incumbents. #@# 

Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's 
most formidable foe, with ex-Gov& Knight a close second. 
But the rest of the ~GOP gubernatorial aspirants don't worry 
him very much.   In his ~CDC work, Carvey has the close-in 
support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists: 
former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren, 
who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty& Gen& 
Stanley Mosk. (Significantly, bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle 
that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren 
are still audible in party circles.) #@#

NOTE: We've 
just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment 
organizing convention Wednesday night in South 
Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg&, which graphically illustrates the 
~CDC's broad appeal. State Sen& Dick Richards will keynote; 
state and county 
committeemen, ~CDC directors and representatives, 
members of 16 area clubs, and "all residents" have been invited.

This is going to be a language lesson, and you can master it in 
a few minutes. It is a short course in Communese.   It works 
with English, Russian, German, Hungarian or almost any other foreign 
tongue. Once you learn how to translate Communese, much of each 
day's deluge of news will become clearer. At least, I have found it 
so. #@#

For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated 
Dr& Freud, Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably 
impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves. They 
accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves 
are most guilty.   President Kennedy's latest warning to the 
Communist world that the United States will build up its military 
strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was somewhat surprisingly, 
reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the
