liquor I rode him pretty hard I guess. Occasionally if I pushed 
him too far he'd give me a look out of narrowed eyes and the hard cruel 
bony skull would show through that smooth face of his. "Some day", 
I told Eileen, "that guy will kill us both". She just wouldn't 
listen.   Getting drunk every night was the only way I 
could handle the situation. Eileen seemed to feel the same way. We still 
had that much in common. The trouble was drinking cost money. The 
way Eileen and I were hitting it up, we needed ten or fifteen dollars 
an evening. Eileen must have wheedled a little out of Precious. 
I raised some kale by hocking the good clothes I had left over from 
my respectable uptown life, but when that was gone I didn't have a 
cent. I don't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer hadn't 
come to town.   Pat O'Dwyer looked like a heavier Jim. 
He had the same bullet head of curly reddish hair but he didn't have 
Jim's pokerfaced humor or his brains or his charm. He was a big 
thick beefy violent man. Now Pat may have been a lecher and a plugugly, 
but he was a good churchgoing Catholic and he loved his little 
sister. Those O'Dwyers had that Irish clannishness that made them 
stick 
together in spite of politics and everything.   Pat took Eileen 
and me out to dinner at a swell steak house and told us with tears 
in his eyes how happy he was we had come together again. "Whom God 
hath joined" etcetera. The O'Dwyers were real religious people 
except for Kate. Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl 
out of mischief. Pat had been worried as hell ever since she'd lost 
her job on that fashion magazine. It had gone big with the Hollywood 
girls when he told them his sister was an editor of <Art and Apparel>. 
How about me trying to help her get her job back?   All 
evening Eileen had been as demure as a little girl getting ready 
for her first communion. It just about blew us both out of the water 
when Eileen suddenly came out with what she came out with. "But brother 
I can't take a job right now", she said with her eyes on her 
ice cream, "I'm going to have a baby, Francis Xavier's baby, 
my own husband's baby".   My first thought was how had it 
happened so soon, but I counted back on my fingers and sure enough we'd 
been living together six weeks. Pat meanwhile was bubbling over with 
sentiment. Greatest thing that ever happened. Now Eileen really 
would have to settle down to love honor and obey, and she'd have to 
quit drinking. He'd come East for the christening, by God he would. 
When we separated that evening Pat pushed a hundred dollar bill 
into Eileen's hand to help towards a layette.   Before he left 
town Pat saw to it that I was fixed up with a job. Pat had contacts 
all over the labor movement. A friend of Pat's named Frank Sposato 
had just muscled into the Portwatchers' Union.   The portwatchers 
were retired longshoremen and small time seafarers off towboats 
and barges who acted as watchmen on the wharves. Most of them were 
elderly men. It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work because 
the thieving is awful in the port of New York. They weren't as 
well paid as they should have been. One reason the portwatchers let 
Sposato take them over was to get the protection of his musclemen.

Sposato needed a front, some labor stiff with a clean record to 
act as business agent of the Redhook local. There I was a retired 
wobbly and structural iron worker who'd never gouged a cent off a fellow 
worker in my thirty years in the movement. For once radicalism was 
a recommendation.   Sposato couldn't wait to get me hired. 
With my gray hair and my weatherbeaten countenance I certainly looked 
the honest working stiff. The things a man will do for a woman. 
There was one fact which Rector could not overlook, one truth which 
he could not deny. As long as there were two human beings working together 
on the same project, there would be competition and you could no 
more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave. No matter 
how devoted a man was, no matter how fully he gave his life to the Lord, 
he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that gave him definition 
as an individual. All of the jobs in the mission might be equal 
in the eyes of the Lord, but they were certainly not equal in the 
eyes of the Lord's servants. It was only natural that Fletcher would 
strive for a position in which he could make the decisions.

Even Rector himself was prey to this spirit of competition and he 
knew it, not for a more exalted office in the hierarchy of the church- 
his ambitions for the bishopry had died very early in his career- 
but for the one clear victory he had talked about to the colonel. He 
was not sure how much of this desire was due to his devotion to the church 
and how much was his own ego, demanding to be satisfied, for the two 
were intertwined and could not be separated. He wanted desperately 
to see Kayabashi defeated, the Communists in the village rooted out, 
the mission standing triumphant, for in the triumph of the Lord he 
himself would be triumphant, too. But perhaps this was a part of the 
eternal plan, that man's ambition when linked with God would be a driving, 
indefatigable force for good in the world.   He sighed. 
How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith 
would suffice. He would have to work without questioning the motives 
which made him work and content himself with the thought that the 
eventual victory, however it was brought about, would be sweet indeed.

His first move was to send Hino to the village to spend a few days. 
His arm had been giving him some trouble and Rector was not enough 
of a medical expert to determine whether it had healed improperly or 
whether Hino was simply rebelling against the tedious work in the print 
shop, using the stiffness in his arm as an excuse. In any event Rector 
sent him to the local hospital to have it checked, telling him to 
keep his ears open while he was in the village to see if he could find 
out what Kayabashi was planning.   Hino was elated at the prospect. 
He was allowed to spend his nights at an inn near the hospital 
and he was given some extra money to go to the <pachinko> parlor- 
an excellent place to make contact with the enemy. He left with all 
the joyous spirit of a child going on a holiday, nodding attentively 
as Rector gave him his final instructions. He was to get involved in 
no 
arguments; he was to try to make no converts; he was simply to listen 
and report back what he heard.   It was a ridiculous situation 
and Rector knew it, for Hino, frankly partisan, openly gregarious, 
would make a poor espionage agent. If he wanted to know anything, he 
would end up asking about it point-blank, but in this guileless manner 
he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to 
get them by indirection. In all of his experience in the mission field 
Rector had never seen a convert quite like Hino. From the moment 
that Hino had first walked into the mission to ask for a job, any job- 
his qualifications neatly written on a piece of paper in a precise 
hand- he had been ready to become a Christian. He had already been 
studying the Bible; he knew the fundamentals, and after studying 
with Fletcher for a time he approached Rector, announced that he wanted 
to be baptized and that was that.   Rector had never been able 
to find out much about Hino's past. Hino talked very little about 
himself except for the infrequent times when he used a personal illustration 
in connection with another subject. Putting the pieces of 
this mosaic together, Rector had the vague outlines of a biography. Hino 
was the fourth son of an elderly farmer who lived on the coast, in 
Chiba, and divided his life between the land and the sea, supplementing 
the marginal livelihood on his small rented farm with seasonal employment 
on a fishing boat. Without exception Hino's brothers turned 
to either one or both of their father's occupations, but Hino showed 
a talent for neither and instead spent most of his time on the beach 
where he repaired nets and proved immensely popular as a storyteller. 
He had gone into the Japanese navy, had been trained as an officer, 
had participated in one or two battles- he never went into detail 
regarding his military experience- and at the age of twenty-five, 
quite as a bolt out of the blue, he had walked into the mission as if 
he belonged here and had become a Christian. Rector was often curious; 
often tempted to ask questions but he never did. If and when Hino 
decided to tell him about his experiences, he would do so unasked.

Rector had no doubt that Hino would come back from the village 
bursting with information, ready to impart it with his customary gusto, 
liberally embellished with his active imagnation. When the telephone 
rang on the day after Hino went down to the village, Rector had 
a hunch it would be Hino with some morsel of information too important 
to wait until his return, for there were few telephones in the village 
and the phone in Rector's office rarely rang unless it was important. 
He was surprised to find Kayabashi's secretary on the other 
end of the line. He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi 
wanted. The <oyabun> was entertaining a group of dignitaries, the 
secretary said, businessmen from Tokyo for the most part, and Kayabashi 
wished to show them the mission. They had never seen one before 
and had expressed a curiosity about it.   "Oh"? Rector 
said. "I guess it will be all right. When would the <oyabun> like 
to bring his guests up here"?   "This afternoon", the 
secretary said. "At three o'clock if it will be of convenience to 
you at that time".   "All right", Rector said. "I will 
be expecting them".   He was about to hang up the phone, but 
a note of hesitancy in the secretary's voice left the conversation 
open. He had something more to say. "I beg to inquire if the back 
is now safe for travelers", he said.   Rector laughed despite 
himself. "Unless the <oyabun> has been working on it", he said, 
then checked himself and added: "You can tell Kayabashi-<san> 
that the back road is in very good condition and will be quite safe for 
his party to use".   "<Arigato gosaimasu>". The secretary 
sighed with relief and then the telephone clicked in Rector's 
hand.   Rector had no idea why Kayabashi wanted to visit the mission. 
For the <oyabun> to make such a trip was either a sign of great 
weakness or an indication of equally great confidence, and from all 
the available information it was probably the latter. Kayabashi must 
feel fairly certain of his victory in order to make a visit like this, 
a trip which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people in the 
village. 
At the same time, it was unlikely that any businessmen would spend 
a day in a Christian mission out of mere curiosity. No, Kayabashi 
was bringing his associates here for a specific purpose and Rector 
would not be able to fathom it until they arrived.   When he had 
given the call a few moments thought, he went into the kitchen to ask 
Mrs& Yamata to prepare tea and <sushi> for the visitors, using 
the formal English china and the silver tea service which had been 
donated to the mission, then he went outside to inspect the grounds. Fujimoto 
had a pile of cuttings near one side of the lawn. Rector asked 
him to move it for the time being; he wanted the mission compound 
to be effortlessly spotless. A good initial impression would be important 
now. He went into the print shop, where Fletcher had just finished 
cleaning the press.   "How many pamphlets do we have in stock"? 
Rector said.   "I should say about a hundred thousand", 
Fletcher said. "Why"?   "I would like to enact 
a little tableau this afternoon", Rector said, He explained about 
the visit and the effect he wished to create, the picture of a very busy 
mission. He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi exactly, just to display 
the mission activities in a graphic and impressive manner. Fletcher 
nodded as he listened to the instructions and said he would arrange 
the things Rector requested.   Rector's next stop was at 
the schoolroom, where Mavis was monitoring a test. He beckoned to her 
from the door and she slipped quietly outside. He told her of the visitors 
and then of his plans. "How many children do you have present 
today"? he said.   She looked back toward the schoolroom. 
"Fifteen", she said. "No, only fourteen. The little Ito girl 
had to go home. She has a pretty bad cold".   "I would 
like them to appear very busy today, not busy exactly, but joyous, exuberant, 
full of life. I want to create the impression of a compound 
full of children. Do you think you can manage it"?   Mavis 
smiled. "I'll try".   As Rector was walking back toward 
the residential hall, Johnson came out of the basement and bounded up 
to him. The altercation in the coffee house had done little to dampen 
his spirits, but he was still a little wary around Rector for they
