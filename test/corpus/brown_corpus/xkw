brick and clay products suitable for shelter construction. _UNDERGROUND 
CONCRETE SHELTER_ An underground reinforced concrete shelter 
can be built by a contractor for about $1,000 to $1,500, depending 
on the type of entrance. The shelter shown would provide almost absolute 
fallout protection.   The illustration (fig& 11) shows this 
shelter with the roof at ground level and mounded over. The same shelter 
could be built into an embankment or below ground level. Plans 
for the shelter, with either a stairway or hatchway entrance, are shown 
on pages 26 and 27.   Another type of shelter which gives excellent 
fallout protection can be built as an added room to the basement 
of a home under construction. It would add about $500 to the total 
cost of the home. The shelter illustrated in figure 12 is based on such 
a room built in a new home in the Washington, D&C& area in the 
Spring of 1959.   {IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS} common 
to each type of shelter are: _1._ Arrangement of the entrance. 
_2._ Ventilation. _3._ Radio reception. _4._ Lighting.

{THE ENTRANCE} must have at least one right-angle turn. 
Radiation scatters somewhat like light. Some will go around a corner. 
The rest continues in a straight line. Therefore, sharp turns 
in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter.

{VENTILATION} is provided in a concrete block basement 
shelter by vents in the wall and by the open entrance. A blower 
may be installed to increase comfort.   A blower is essential 
for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelters. It should 
provide not less than 5 cubic feet per minute of air per person. Vent 
pipes also are necessary (as shown in figs& 9, 10, and 11), but 
filters are not.   {RADIO RECEPTION} is cut down by the 
shielding necessary to keep out radiation. As soon as the shelter is 
completed a radio reception check must be made. It probably will be 
necessary to install an outside antenna, particularly to receive ~CONELRAD 
broadcasts.   {LIGHTING} is an important 
consideration. Continuous low-level lighting may be provided in the 
shelter by means of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which is wired a 150-milliampere 
flashlight-type bulb. Tests have shown that such a device, 
with a fresh battery, will furnish light continuously for at least 
10 days. With a spare battery, a source of light for 2 weeks or more 
would be assured. A flashlight or electric lantern also should be available 
for those periods when a brighter light is needed. There should 
be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter as power may continue 
in many areas.   {OTHER CONSIDERATIONS}.- If there 
are outside windows in the basement corner where you build a shelter, 
they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix, page 29. Other basement 
windows should be blocked when an emergency threatens. Basement 
walls that project above the ground should be shielded as shown in the 
Appendix, page 29.   In these shelters the entrance should be 
not more than 2 feet wide. Bunks, or materials to build them, may have 
to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter walls are completed.

The basement or belowground shelters also will serve for tornado 
or hurricane protection. #/3,. LIVING IN A SHELTER#

@ 
The 
radioactivity of fallout decays rapidly at first. <Forty-nine hours 
after an atomic burst the radiation intensity is only about 1 percent 
of what it was an hour after the explosion. But the radiation may 
be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous>.

Therefore, civil defense instructions received over ~CONELRAD 
or by other means should be followed. A battery-powered 
radio is essential. Radiation instruments suitable for home use are 
available, and would be of value in locating that portion of the home 
which offers the best protection against fallout radiation. There is 
a possibility that battery-powered radios with built-in radiation meters 
may become available. One instrument thus would serve both purposes.

Your local civil defense will gather its own information and 
will receive broad information from State and Federal sources. It 
will tell you as soon as possible:   How long to stay in your 
shelter.   How soon you may go outdoors.   How long you 
may stay outside.   You should be prepared to stay in your shelter 
full time for at least several days and to make it your home for 14 
days or longer. A checklist in the Appendix, (page 30) tells what is 
needed. Families with children will have particular problems. They 
should provide for simple recreation.   There should be a task 
for everyone and these tasks should be rotated. Part of the family should 
be sleeping while the rest is awake.   To break the monotony 
it may be necessary to invent tasks that will keep the family busy. 
Records such as diaries can be kept.   The survival of the family 
will depend largely on information received by radio. A record should 
be kept of the information and instructions, including the time and 
date of broadcast.   Family rationing probably will be necessary.

Blowers should be operated periodically on a regular schedule. 
There will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation 
has decayed enough to allow use of the whole basement. However, as 
much time as possible should be spent within the shelter to hold radiation 
exposure to a minimum.   The housekeeping problems of living 
in a shelter will begin as soon as the shelter is occupied. Food, medical 
supplies, utensils, and equipment, if not already stored in the 
shelter, must be quickly gathered up and carried into it.   After 
the family has settled in the shelter, the housekeeping rules should 
be spelled out by the adult in charge.   Sanitation in the confines 
of the family shelter will require much thought and planning.

Provision for emergency toilet facilities and disposal of human 
wastes will be an unfamiliar problem. A covered container such as a kitchen 
garbage pail might do as a toilet. A 10-gallon garbage can, with 
a tightly fitting cover, could be used to keep the wastes until it 
is safe to leave the shelter.   Water rationing will be difficult 
and should be planned carefully.   A portable electric heater 
is advisable for shelters in cold climates. It would take the chill from 
the shelter in the beginning. Even if the electric power fails after 
an attack, any time that the heater has been used will make the shelter 
that much more comfortable. Body heat in the close quarters will 
help keep up the temperature. Warm clothing and bedding, of course, 
are essential.   Open-flame heating or cooking should be avoided. 
A flame would use up air.   Some families already have held 
weekend rehearsals in their home shelters to learn the problems and to 
determine for themselves what supplies they would need. #/4,. IF 
AN ATTACK FINDS YOU WITHOUT A PREPARED SHELTER#

@ Few areas, if any, 
are as good as prepared shelters but they are worth knowing about.

A family dwelling without a basement provides some natural shielding 
from fallout radiation. On the ground floor the radiation would 
be about half what it is outside. The best protection would be on 
the ground floor in the central part of the house.   A belowground 
basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside 
level. The safest place is the basement corner least exposed to windows 
and deepest below ground.   If there is time after the warning, 
the basement shielding could be improved substantially by blocking 
windows with bricks, dirt, books, magazines, or other heavy material. 
#/5,. SHELTER IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS#

@ Large apartment buildings 
of masonry or concrete provide better natural shelter than the usual 
family dwellings. In general, such apartments afford more protection 
than smaller buildings because their walls are thick and there is 
more space.   The central area of the ground floor of a heavily 
constructed apartment building, with concrete floors, should provide 
more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling. 
The basement of such an apartment building may provide as much natural 
protection as the specially constructed concrete block shelter recommended 
for the basement of a family dwelling.   The Federal 
Government is aiding local governments in several places to survey residential, 
commercial and industrial buildings to determine what fallout 
protection they would provide, and for how many people.   The 
problem for the city apartment dweller is primarily to plan the use 
of existing space. Such planning will require the cooperation of other 
occupants and of the apartment management.

A former du Pont official became a General Motors vice president 
and set about maximizing du Pont's share of the General Motors 
market. Lines of communications were established between the two 
companies and several du Pont products were actively promoted. Within 
a few years various du Pont manufactured items were filling the entire 
requirements of from four to seven of General Motors' eight operating 
divisions. The Fisher Body division, long controlled by the 
Fisher brothers under a voting trust even though General Motors owned 
a majority of its stock, followed an independent course for many years, 
but by 1947 and 1948 "resistance had collapsed" and its purchases 
from du Pont "compared favorably" with purchases by other General 
Motors divisions. Competitors came to receive higher percentage 
of General Motors business in later years, but it is "likely" 
that this trend stemmed "at least in part" from the needs of General 
Motors outstripping du Pont's capacity. "  The fact 
that sticks out in this voluminous record is that the bulk of du Pont's 
production has always supplied the largest part of the requirements 
of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du Pont 
by a stock interest. The inference is overwhelming that du Pont's 
commanding position was promoted by its stock interest and was not gained 
solely on competitive merit". 353 U& S&, at 605. 
This Court agreed with the trial court "that considerations of price, 
quality and service were not overlooked by either du Pont or General 
Motors". 353 U& S&, at 606. However, it determined that 
neither this factor, nor "the fact that all concerned in high executive 
posts in both companies acted honorably and fairly, each in the 
honest conviction that his actions were in the best interests of his own 
company and without any design to overreach anyone, including du Pont's 
competitors", 353 U& S&, at 607, outweighed the Government's 
claim for relief. This claim, as submitted to the District 
Court and dismissed by it, 126 F&Supp&235, alleged violation 
not only of @ 7 of the Clayton Act, but also of @ @ 1 and 2 of 
the Sherman Act. The latter provisions proscribe any contract, combination, 
or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade, and 
monopolization of, or attempts, combinations, or conspiracies to monopolize, 
such trade. However, this Court put to one side without consideration 
the Government's appeal from the dismissal of its Sherman 
Act allegations. It rested its decision solely on @ 7, which reads 
in pertinent part: "  [N]o corporation engaged in commerce 
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, the whole or any part of 
the stock or other share capital of another corporation engaged also in 
commerce, where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially 
lessen competition between the corporation whose stock is so acquired 
and the corporation making the acquisition, or to restrain such commerce 
in any section or community, or tend to create a monopoly of any 
line of commerce. @   This section shall not apply to corporations 
purchasing such stock solely for investment and not using the same 
by voting or otherwise to bring about, or in attempting to bring about, 
the substantial lessening of competition **h".   The purpose 
of this provision was thus explained in the Court's opinion: 
"  Section 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency not only 
the substantial lessening of competition from the acquisition by one corporation 
of the whole or any part of the stock of a competing corporation, 
but also to arrest in their incipiency restraints or monopolies 
in a relevant market which, as a reasonable probability, appear at the
