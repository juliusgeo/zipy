when vehicle costs become excessive, and when cars should be traded 
for sound economies. From this, motor pool personnel develop other 
meaningful and related data. In 1959-60, vehicles averaged an operating 
cost of .027@ per mile. Based on this figure and considering depreciation 
costs of vehicles, pool personnel have determined that travel 
in excess of 10,000 miles annually is more economical by state car 
than by payment of allowances for use of personally-owned vehicles. They 
estimate further that with sufficient experience and when cost-data 
of compact cars is compiled, the break-even point may be reduced to 
7,500 miles of travel per year. Table 2 shows operating cost data of 
state vehicles selected at random.   One matter of concern to 
the complete effectiveness of pool operations is the lack of adequate 
central garage facilities. Present pool quarters at two locations in 
Providence are crowded, antiquated and, in general, make for inefficient 
operation in terms of dispersement of personnel and duplication of 
such operational needs as stock and repair equipment. Good facilities 
would be a decided help to pool operations and probably reduce vehicle 
costs even more. _PURCHASING PRACTICES._ The purchase of state-owned 
vehicles is handled in the same manner as all other purchases 
of the state. Requests are made by the motor pool along with any necessary 
cooperation from the agencies to which assignments of cars will 
be made. Bids are evaluated by the Division of Purchases with the 
assistance of pool staff, and awards for the purchase of the automobiles 
are made to the lowest responsible bidders. Unit prices for state 
vehicles are invariably lower than to the general public. The reasons 
are obvious: (1) the state is buying in quantity, and (2) it has no 
federal excise or state sales tax to pay. Until 1958 the state was also 
entitled to a special type of manufacturers' discount through the 
dealers.   In that ownership of all vehicles rests with the state 
motor pool, cars are paid for with funds appropriated to the agencies 
but transferred to the rotary fund mentioned earlier. This is a normal 
governmental procedure which reflects more accurately cost-accounting 
principles. The assignment and use of vehicles after purchase is 
another matter to be covered in detail later. 

#VEHICLE PURCHASE, 
ASSIGNMENT, AND USE POLICIES#

Probably the most important of all matters 
for review are the broad administrative policies governing the purchase, 
assignment, use, and management of state vehicles. The legislature's 
role in policy determination in this area for years has been 
confined almost solely to the amount of funds appropriated annually 
for the purchase and operation of vehicles. The more meaningful policies 
have been left to the judgment of the chief administrative officer 
of the state- the Director of Administration. 

#THE RHODE ISLAND PROPERTY TAX#

There was a time some years ago when 
local taxation by the cities and towns was sufficient to support their 
own operations and a part of the cost of the state government as 
well. For many years a state tax on cities and towns was paid by the 
several municipalities to the state from the proceeds of the general property 
tax. This tax was discontinued in 1936.   Since that time 
the demands of the citizens for new and expanded services have placed 
financial burdens on the state which could not have been foreseen in 
earlier years. At the same time there has been an upgrading and expansion 
of municipal services as well. Thus, there has come into being 
a situation in which the state must raise all of its own revenues and, 
in addition, must give assistance to its local governments.   This 
financial assistance from the state has become necessary because 
the local governments themselves found the property tax, or at least at 
the rates then existing, insufficient for their requirements. 
Consequently there have developed several forms of grants-in-aid and 
shared taxes, as well as the unrestricted grant to local governments 
for general purposes whose adoption accompanied the introduction of a 
sales tax at the state level.   Notwithstanding state aid, the local 
governments are continuing to seek additional revenue of their own 
by strengthening the property tax. This is being done both by the revaluation 
of real property and by seeking out forms of personal property 
hitherto neglected or ignored.   Taxation of tangible movable 
property in Rhode Island has been generally of a "hands off" nature 
due possibly to several reasons: (1) local assessors, in the main, 
are not well paid and have inadequate office staffs, (2) the numerous 
categories of this component of personal property make locating extremely 
difficult, and (3) the inexperience of the majority of assessors 
in evaluating this type of property. _PROBLEMS OF TAXING PERSONAL 
PROPERTY._ Among the many problems in the taxing of personal property, 
and of movable tangible property in particular, two are significant: 
(1) situs, (2) fair and equitable assessment of value. These 
problems are not local to Rhode Island, but are recognized as common 
to all states. _SITUS OF PROPERTY._ Although the laws of the various 
states, in general, specify the situs of property, i&e&, residence 
or domicile of the owner, or location of the property, the exceptions 
regarding boats, airplanes, mobile homes, etc&, seem to add to 
the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment.

Rhode Island law specifies that all real estate is taxable in the 
town in which it is situated. It also provides for the taxation of all 
personal property, belonging to inhabitants of the state, both tangible 
and intangible, and the tangible personal property of non-residents 
in this state. In defining personal property, it specifically mentions 
"all ships or vessels, at home or abroad".   Intangible 
property is taxable wherever the owner has a place of abode the greater 
portion of the year. Although a similar situs for tangible property 
is mentioned in the statute, this is cancelled out by the provision 
that definite kinds of property "and all other tangible property" 
situated or being in any town is taxable where the property is situated. 
This would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property 
at its location on December 31.   Both boats and aircraft would 
fall within this category, as well as motor vehicles. The location 
of the latter now is determined for tax purposes at the time of registration, 
and it is now accepted practice to consider a motor vehicle 
as being situated where it is garaged. Obviously, it would be impossible 
to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of December. 
In view of the acceptance accorded the status of motor vehicles 
for tax purposes, in the absence of any specific provision it would 
seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boats or 
aircraft.   A recent example of this problem is the flying of six 
airplanes, on December 31, 1960, from the Newport Airpark in Middletown, 
to the North Central Airport in Smithfield. This situation 
resulted in both towns claiming the tax, and probably justifiably. 
Middletown bases its claim on the general provision of the law that "all 
rateable property, both tangible and intangible, shall be taxed 
to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have had his 
actual place of abode for the larger portion of the twelve (12) months 
next preceding the first day of April in each year".   The 
Smithfield tax assessor, in turn, claims the tax under the provision 
of law "**h and all other tangible personal property situated or being 
in any town, in or upon any **h place of storage **h shall be taxed 
to such person **h in the town where said property is situated". 
_ASSESSMENT OF VALUE._ This problem of fair and equitable assessment 
of value is a difficult one to solve in that the determination of 
fair valuation is dependent on local assessors, who in general are 
non-professional 
and part-time personnel taking an individualistic approach 
to the problem. This accounts for the wide variance in assessment 
practices of movable tangible property in the various municipalities in 
Rhode Island.   This condition will undoubtedly continue until 
such time as a state uniform system of evaluation is established, 
or through mutual agreement of the local assessing officials for a method 
of standard assessment practice to be adopted.   The Rhode 
Island Public Expenditure Council in its publication once commented: 
"  The most realistic way of facing up to this problem would 
be to have the State take over full responsibility for assessing 
all taxable property. An adequately staffed and equipped State assessing 
office could apply uniform methods and standards which would go far 
toward producing equitable assessments on all properties throughout 
the State. A single statewide assessing unit would eliminate the differences 
and complications that are inherent in a system of 39 different 
and independent assessing units".   The Institute of Public 
Administration, in its report to the State Fiscal Study Commission 
in 1959, recommended "consolidating and centralizing all aspects 
of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally 
organized and equipped for the job". The resulting setup, it was 
declared, "would be similar to that which is in successful operation 
in a number of metropolitan counties as large or larger than Rhode 
Island". _PRACTICES IN RHODE ISLAND._ To determine the practice 
and attitude of municipal governments concerning tangible movable property, 
a questionnaire was sent to all local government assessors or 
boards of assessors in Rhode Island.   The replies from each 
individual town are not given in detail because the questions asked the 
personal opinion of the several assessors and are not necessarily the 
established policy of the town in each case. There are legitimate reasons 
for differences of opinion among the assessors as a whole and among 
the public officials in each town. These opinions of the assessors 
are of significance in indicating what their thinking seems to be at 
the present time.   In reply to a question of whether they now 
tax boats, airplanes and other movable property excluding automobiles, 
nineteen said that they did and twenty that they did not. The wording 
of the question was quite general and may have been subject to different 
interpretations. One assessor checked boats only, another trailers 
and tractors, one mentioned house trailers, and two others referred 
to trailers without specifying the type. In two cases, airplanes only 
were indicated.   It is difficult to tabulate exactly what was 
meant in each individual situation, but the conclusion may be drawn 
that 21 towns do not assess movable personal property, and of the remainder 
only certain types are valued for tax purposes. Boats were indicated 
specifically by only one of the five towns known to tax boats. 
It would seem, then, that movable property and equipment is not taxed 
as a whole but that certain types are taxed in towns where this is bound 
to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property.

So few answered the question relating to their efforts to assess 
movable property that the results are inconclusive. Only four towns indicated 
that they made any more than a normal effort to list property 
of this kind.   Of greater interest is a question as to whether 
movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership. 
Fifteen stated that it was according to location, four by residence 
of the owner, and nineteen did not answer.   Twenty-seven assessors 
stated that they were in favor of improved means for assessing movable 
personal property, and only five were opposed. Seven others expressed 
no opinion. On this point there was fairly general agreement that 
assessors would like to do more than they are doing now. It is not 
clear, however, whether they are thinking of all movable property or 
only of boats, trailers, aircraft or certain other types of personal 
property whose assessment would be advantageous to their particular towns.

Another question that was asked of the assessors was whether 
they favored the assessment of movable property at its location or 
at the residence of the owner. Eighteen voted for assessment by the 
town in which it is located and eleven preferred assessment by the town 
in which the owner resides. Ten others made no reply. Of those who 
have an opinion, it seems that assessment by location is preferred. There 
was one vote for location being the place where the property is 
situated for the greater portion of the twelve months preceding the assessment 
date.   To summarize, it may be said that there is no one 
prevailing practice in Rhode Island with respect to the taxation 
of movable property, that assessors would like to see an improvement,
