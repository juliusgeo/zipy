<Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled>, That the 
Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to make 
or cause to be made a study covering- _(1)_ the causes of injuries 
and health hazards in metal and nonmetallic mines (excluding coal 
and lignite mines); _(2)_ the relative effectiveness of voluntary 
versus mandatory reporting of accident statistics; _(3)_ the 
relative contribution to safety of inspection programs embodying- _(A)_ 
right-of-entry only and _(B)_ right-of-entry plus enforcement 
authority; _(4)_ the effectiveness of health and safety education 
and training; _(5)_ the magnitude of effort and costs of each 
of these possible phases of an effective safety program for metal 
and nonmetallic mines (excluding coal and lignite mines); and _(6)_ 
the scope and adequacy of State mine-safety laws applicable to such 
mines and the enforcement of such laws. _SEC& 2. (A)_ The Secretary 
of the Interior or any duly authorized representative shall 
be entitled to admission to, and to require reports from the operator 
of, any metal or nonmetallic mine which is in a State (excluding any 
coal or lignite mine), the products of which regularly enter commerce 
or the operations of which substantially affect commerce, for the purpose 
of gathering data and information necessary for the study authorized 
in the first section of this Act. _(B)_ As used in this section- 
_(1)_ the term "State" includes the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico and any possession of the United States; and _(2)_ 
the term "commerce" means commerce between any State and any place 
outside thereof, or between points within the same State but through 
any place outside thereof. _SEC& 3._ The Secretary of the Interior 
shall submit a report of his findings, together with recommendations 
for an effective safety program for metal and nonmetallic mines 
(excluding coal and lignite mines) based upon such findings, to the 
Congress not more than two years after the date of enactment of this 
Act.   Approved September 26, 1961.

<Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled>, That the 
Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized and directed to establish 
and maintain a program of stabilization payments to small domestic 
producers of lead and zinc ores and concentrates in order to stabilize 
the mining of lead and zinc by small domestic producers on public, 
Indian, and other lands as provided in this Act. _SEC& 2. (A)_ 
Subject to the limitations of this Act, the Secretary shall make 
stabilization payments to small domestic producers upon presentation of 
evidence satisfactory to him of their status as such producers and of 
the sale by them of newly mined ores, or concentrates produced therefrom, 
as provided in this Act. Payments shall be made only with respect 
to the metal content as determined by assay. _(B)_ Such payments 
shall be made to small domestic producers of lead as long as the market 
price for common lead at New York, New York, as determined by 
the Secretary, is below 14-1/2 cents per pound, and such payments shall 
be 75 per centum of the difference between 14-1/2 cents per pound 
and the average market price for the month in which the sale occurred 
as determined by the Secretary. _(C)_ Such payments shall be made 
to small domestic producers of zinc as long as the market price for 
prime western zinc at East Saint Louis, Illinois, as determined by 
the Secretary, is below 14-1/2 cents per pound, and such payments shall

the calendar year 1964 shall not exceed $4,000,000; and the maximum 
amount of such payments which may be made on account of such sales 
made during the calendar year 1965 shall not exceed $3,500,000. 
In the same period, 431 presentations by members of the staff were made 
to local, national, and international medical groups. _3. EDUCATION:_ 
_A._ The education function of the Institute is carried 
on by the staff in the departments of pathology and its consultants. 
During fiscal year 1959, six courses were conducted: Forensic Pathology, 
Application of Histochemistry to Pathology, Pathology of Diseases 
of Laboratory Animals, Opthalmic Pathology, Pathology of 
the Oral Regions, and a Cardiovasculatory Pathology Seminar. During 
fiscal year 1960, seven courses were conducted: Application of 
Histochemistry to Pathology, Forensic Pathology, Pathology of Diseases 
of Laboratory Animals, Pathology of the Oral Regions, Opthalmic 
Pathology, Forensic Sciences Symposium, and Orthopedic Pathology. 
From 1 July 1960 through 31 January 1961, six courses were 
conducted: Workshop in Resident Training in Pathology, Pathology 
of Diseases of Laboratory Animals, Application of Histochemistry 
of Pathology, Orthopedic Pathology, Forensic Sciences Symposium, 
and Forensic Pathology. _B._ During fiscal years 1959 and 
1960, there were 139 military and civilian students who came to the Institute 
for varying periods of special instruction. _4. RESEARCH:_ 
The Institute is engaged in an extensive program of medico-military 
scientific research in both morphological and experimental pathology. 
Among the specific areas of concentration in which the staff is engaged, 
are such projects as biological and biochemical studies of the 
effects of microwaves; study of motor end plates in man and animals; 
investigation of respiratory diseases of laboratory animals; metabolic 
responses to reduced oxygen tension; neuropathology of nuclear 
and cosmic radiation; carcinoma of prostate; evaluation of histochemical 
techniques; and hip dysplasia in dogs. There has been an 
increase in cooperative research with other Federal agencies and civilian 
institutions.   During the period from 1 July 1960 through 
31 January 1961, additional research affiliations were effected with 
the U& S& Army Medical Research and Development Command to 
conduct research in procedures for quantitative electron microscopy, and 
for the study of biophysical and biological studies of the structure 
and function of ocular tissue. Also, the Defense Atomic Support 
Agency sponsored a long-range study at this Institute on the response 
of massive suspension cultures of mammalian cells to acute radiation. 
Other scientific agencies, both Federal and civilian, supported studies 
in quantitative electron microscopical approach to microchemistry 
and microcytochemistry; the investigation of the relationship of 
diphosphopyridine 
nucleotide synthesizine enzyme to tumor growth; morphological 
study and classification of leukemia and lymphoma cases in 
animals; and the study of structural changes in M& leprae and other 
mycobacteria. _MEDICAL ILLUSTRATION SERVICE_ _1._ The Medical 
Illustration Service is responsible for the collection, publication, 
exhibition, and file of medical illustration material of medico-military 
importance to the Armed Forces. In addition to maintaining 
a permanent central file of illustrations of diseases, wounds, and injuries 
of military importance, it provides facilities for clinical photography, 
photomicrography, and medical arts, and operates a printing 
plant, by permission of Congressional Committee, for publication of 
an "Atlas of Tumor Pathology". It also maintains shops for the 
design and fabrication of exhibits, training aids and instruments and 
libraries for the loan of films and teaching lantern slide sets. _2._ 
During this period, a total of 762 exhibits were presented at 442 
medical and scientific meetings. Of these exhibits, 154 were newly 
constructed. Twenty-nine exhibits received awards. _3._ Visual and 
operable training aids developed by the Medical Illustration Service, 
were used in support of Army Medical Service mass casualty exercises. 
Members of the Medical Illustration Service lectured and 
conducted demonstrations on the use of training aids to military personnel 
and various civilian medical organizations. Demonstrations of new 
and projected training aids were conducted at the Medical Service 
Instructor's Conference, Brooke Army Medical Center, Texas. _4._ 
In support of the emphasis placed by the Department of Defense 
on instruction in emergency medical care, the Medical Illustration 
Service developed casualty simulation kits and rescue breathing manikins 
which are being field tested; and overhead projector transparency 
sets on the subjects of Military Sanitation: First Aid for 
Soldiers; Bandaging and Splinting; the Emergency Medical Treatment 
Unit, Phase /1,; and Emergency War Surgery in support 
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (~NATO) Handbook. 
Fifty lantern slide teaching sets on the subject of "Emergency War 
Surgery (~NATO)" were assembled and distributed to the Medical 
Military Services of foreign Governments associated with ~NATO 
and South-East Asia Treaty Organization. The British and 
Canadian Liaison Officers, as well as Office of Civil and Defense 
Mobilization, the American Red Cross, and similar interested organizations 
were informed from time to time as training aids were developed. 
_5._ Nine veterinary lantern slide teaching sets were developed 
and distributed, and lantern slide teaching sets on 21 pathology 
subjects were added to the loan library of the Medical Illustration 
Service. Illustrations were prepared for 11 Department of the Army 
manuals and one Graphic Training Aid. Sixteen lantern slide sets 
were loaned to the Government of India and eight sets were forwarded 
to the U&S& Embassy, Managua, Nicaragua for the Educational 
Exchange Program. The Senate Subcommittee on Reorganization and 
International Organizations was provided samples of visual aids on 
first aid and personal health produced by the Medical Illustration 
Service. _6._ Six fascicles (10,000 copies each) of the "Atlas 
of Tumor Pathology" were completed during the period of this report. 
_THE AMERICAN REGISTRY OF PATHOLOGY_ This consists of 25 individual 
registries, two of which were added during fiscal years 1959-1960 
(the Registry of Forensic Pathology and the Testicular Tumor 
Registry). These registries are sponsored by 18 national medical, 
dental, and veterinary societies and have as their mission the assembling
