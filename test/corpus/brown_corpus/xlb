effect of destructive agencies, sawtimber growth would have been nearly 
twice as great as the 47 billion board feet in 1952. About 45 percent 
of the loss in growth was attributable to disease, 20 percent to 
insects, 17 percent to fire, and 18 percent to weather, animals, and 
various other causes.   These destructive forces also have a seriously 
adverse effect upon the watersheds and their life-supporting waterflows, 
and upon the other renewable forest resources.   The long-range 
objective is to hold the damage from destructive agencies below 
the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management 
of the National Forest System under principles of multiple use and 
high-level sustained yield of products and services. This can be accomplished 
substantially by a continued trend toward better facilities 
and techniques for fire control and more resources to cope with critical 
fire periods, and a more intensive application of a program of prevention, 
detection, and control of insect and disease infestations. In 
addition to direct protection measures, more intensive management of 
timber resources will assist in reduction of losses from insects and 
disease. _PROTECTION FROM INSECTS AND DISEASE_ In the 10-year period, 
it is proposed that insect and disease control on the National Forest 
System be stepped up to a level of prevention, detection, and 
control of insect and disease infestations that will substantially reduce 
the occurrence of large infestations toward the end of the initial 
period. This will require about a 40 percent increase over the present 
level of protection. The work will consist of: _1._ Intensification 
of present activities through (a) quicker, more extensive, and 
more thorough surveys to detect incipient outbreaks; (b) more reliable 
evaluation of the potential of initial outbreaks to cause widespread 
damage; (c) quicker and more effective control action in the initial 
stages to prevent a large-scale epidemic. The initial suppression 
activities would cover about twice the acreage currently being treated. 
_2._ Continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension 
of control to 250,000 acres not now protected but which should 
be managed for white pine production. The objective is to achieve sufficient 
effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment 
plus the additional acres so that after the initial period only maintenance 
control will be needed. _3._ Initiating a program to control 
dwarfmistletoe on several hundred thousand acres of selected better 
stands of young softwood sawtimber on better growing sites. _4._ 
Coordination of pest control objectives with timber management activities 
to reduce losses. _PROTECTION FROM FIRE_ It is proposed 
that in 
10 years all commercial timberlands, all critical watersheds, and 
other lands in the National Forest System developed or proposed for 
intensive use will be given protection from fire adequate to meet the 
fire situation in the worst years and under serious peak loads. This 
will include 125 million acres compared with 23 million acres now receiving 
such protection. An additional 15 million acres will be given 
a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation.

Meeting these levels of protection from fire calls for: 
_1._ Expansion, modernization, and development of fire control 
to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent as many 
fires as possible and suppress fires before they spread beyond permitted 
standards. This is to be accomplished by nearly doubling the present 
level of preventive effort, detection, skilled fire-fighting crews, 
and equipment use. This will include a stepped-up program of training 
and development of personnel. _2._ Adoption and use of new and 
modern techniques being developed for prevention, for suppression of fires 
while small, and for stopping large fires while running and burning 
intensely. _3._ Reduction of hazardous fuel conditions to minimize 
the chances of large fires developing and spreading to high-value 
areas. This work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land 
needing such treatment, and will consist of burning 250,000 acres of highly 
hazardous debris concentration, felling snags on 350,000 acres of 
high lightning-occurrence areas, prescribed burning on 3.5 million acres, 
removing roadside fuel on 39,000 acres, and clearing and maintaining 
11,000 miles of firebreaks. _PROTECTION FROM OTHER DAMAGE_ Rodent 
control work for the 10-year period will be aimed at control of 
the most serious infestations of harmful rodents, such as porcupines 
and mice, on high-value areas of forage and commercial timberlands. These 
areas comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation 
on the National Forests. Approximately 1.8 million acres of rangelands 
and 9.4 million acres of timberlands would be treated in this period. 
Control would be limited to those rodents for which economical means 
of control are known. 

#ROADS AND TRAILS#

The transportation 
system which serves the National Forests is a complex of highways and 
access roads and trails under various ownerships and jurisdictions. 
This system is divided into a forest highway system, administered by 
the Secretary of Commerce, and a forest development road and trail system, 
administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Both of these 
systems are essential for the production, development, and use of the 
National 
Forests.   In the forest highway system, there are now 
24,400 miles of public roads. These are mostly through highways that 
carry traffic going from one destination to another. Because administration 
of the forest highway system is a responsibility of the Secretary 
of Commerce with maintenance provided by the States and counties, 
this Development Program for the National Forests does not include 
estimates of the funds needed to maintain the forest highway system 
nor to construct the additions to its that are needed. It is estimated 
that about 70,000 miles of forest highways will eventually be needed 
to fully serve the National Forests.   In the forest development 
road and trail system, there are now 162,400 miles of roads and 
106,500 miles of supplemental foot and horse trails. These roads are 
largely of less than highway standards, and usually carry traffic which 
is related to use of the National Forests. Construction and maintenance 
of this system is a responsibility of the Secretary of Agriculture. 
It is estimated that about 542,250 miles of forest development 
roads, and 80,000 miles of trails, constitute the system that will eventually 
be needed to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of 
the wood, water, forage, and wildlife and recreation resources of the 
National Forests on a continuing basis.   The ultimate trail system 
will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization 
and fire protection. It will be carefully planned to maintain optimum 
service to these important resources and watersheds.   The presence 
or lack of access by road or trail has a direct and controlling 
influence on all phases of forest management and utilization such as: 
_(A)_ the protection of forage, timber, and wildlife resources 
from fire, insects, and disease; _(B)_ the balanced use of recreation, 
hunting, and fishing areas; _(C)_ the volume of timber that 
can be marketed, especially for small sales and the support of dependent 
communities and small business enterprises; _(D)_ the level 
of salvage cutting in dead and dying timber stands and the opportunity 
to promptly salvage losses resulting from fire, windstorm, insects, 
and disease; _(E)_ the protection of watershed lands from erosion 
and overgrazing by animals.   The existence of road systems 
permits an intensity of management and use for all National Forest purposes 
that is not otherwise possible. Furthermore, roads that give 
access to National Forest timber are investments which pay their own 
way over a period of years. Use of these roads by the public results 
in substantial benefits to the localities the roads serve.   The 
long-range objective of this Department is to provide and maintain 
a system of forest development roads and trails which will adequately 
service the National Forest System at the levels needed to meet expected 
needs and optimum production of products and services. For the 
year 2000 this means servicing (a) the protection requirements of a watershed 
producing at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year, (b) 
recreation and wildlife resources used each year by 635 million visitors, 
(c) a timber resource supporting an annual cut of 21 billion board 
feet, and (d) 60 million acres of rangelands.   Service at these 
levels of production and utilization will eventually require the 
construction of about 379,900 miles of new roads and 6,000 miles of new 
trails, along with the reconstruction to higher standards of about 105,000 
miles of roads and 10,500 miles of trails. About 26,500 miles 
of existing trails will be replaced in service by the construction of 
new roads. About 80 percent of these long-range requirements should be 
met by the year 2000.   Program proposals for forest development 
roads and trails for the 10-year period 1963-1972 are as follows: 
_1._ Complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79,400 
miles of multiple-purpose roads and 8,000 miles of trails. This constitutes 
about 17 percent of the long-range requirements for these facilities.

Approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on 
roads for access to timber which are planned for this period will be constructed 
by purchasers of National Forest timber, but paid for by 
the Government through adjustment of stumpage prices. _2._ Provide 
maintenance to full standards on the 268,900 miles of existing access 
roads and trails and on the new roads and trails constructed during 
the period. 

#LAND ADJUSTMENT, LAND PURCHASE, LAND USE#

Within the 
units in the National Forest System the pattern of land ownership 
is quite irregular. In some units, National Forest ownership is well 
blocked together. In many others, the previous patenting of land 
under the public land laws, or the way in which land was available for 
purchase, resulted in a scattered pattern of ownership.   Within 
exterior boundaries of National Forests and National Grasslands, 
there are about 40,000,000 acres in non-Federal ownership. One consequence 
is the occurrence of occasional conflicts because private owners 
of some inholdings object to public programs of use on neighboring 
National Forest or other Federal land, or because such ownerships are 
developed for uses that are not compatible with use for the public 
of neighboring National Forest land. Some privately held inholdings 
are a source of direct damage to these Federal lands. And some, which 
are suitable for tree growing and for other National Forest purposes, 
are unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation, and are contributing 
nothing to the economy; there are no reasonable prospects 
that these conditions will be corrected or changed. Lands in this last 
category are situated largely in the mountainous portions of the Eastern 
States.   The long-range objective is to bring about consolidation 
of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through 
purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tracts 
for recognized National Forest programs such as recreation development, 
or which are a source of damage to lands in National Forests 
and National Grasslands.

Strategy and tactics of the U&S& military forces are now 
undergoing one of the greatest transitions in history. The change of 
emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be made 
with care, mindful that the one type of warfare cannot be safely neglected 
in favor of the other. Our military forces must be capable of 
contending successfully with any contingency which may be forced upon 
us, from limited emergencies to all-out nuclear general war. 

#FORCES 
AND MILITARY PERSONNEL STRENGTH.#- This budget will provide in 
the fiscal year 1961 for the continued support of our forces at approximately 
the present level- a year-end strength of 2,489,000 men and 
women in the active forces. The forces to be supported include an Army 
of 14 divisions and 870,000 men; a Navy of 817 active ships and 
619,000 men; a Marine Corps of 3 divisions and 3 air wings with 175,000 
men; and an Air Force of 91 combat wings and 825,000 men.

If the reserve components are to serve effectively in time of war,
