
_TO THE EDITOR:_ Sir- I hasten to join in praise of the 
men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway. Recently I traveled 
the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most 
courteous group of men you will find anywhere. One even gave my little 
dog a biscuit. It was very refreshing. @ 
#"DEEP PEEP SHOW"#

The viewers of the "deep Peep Show" 
at 15th and ~M streets nw& have an added attraction- the view 
of a fossilized cypress swamp. Twenty feet below the street level 
in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site, a black 
coal-like deposit has been encountered.   This is a black swamp 
clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees 
were growing. The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found 
embedded in the clay. Some of the stumps are as much as three feet 
long, but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying 
sediments. Although the wood has been changed to coal, much 
of it still retains its original cell structure.   In the clay are 
entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants 
growing in the region at the time. These microfossils indicate the 
swamp was "formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs 
were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing.

The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with 
the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported 
in <The Washington Post>, August 2, 1955, which was probably 
formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.

#WORKING FOR PEACE#

Recently the secretary of the Friends 
Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air. 
While I respect his sincere concern for peace, he made four points 
that I would like to question. _1._ He said, "Let's work for 
peace instead of protection from aggression". I would ask, "Why 
not do both"? Military power does not cause war; war is the result 
of mistrust and lack of understanding between people. Are we not 
late, especially those of us who call ourselves Friends, in doing enough 
about this lack of understanding? _2._ As to protection, 
the speaker disapproved of shelters, pointing out that fallout shelters 
would not save everyone. Is this a reason for saving no one? Would 
the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his 
boat could not pick up everyone? _3._ The speaker suggested 
that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face. 
If the world comes to this, wouldn't it be the very time when courage 
and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild? 
Many of our young people think it would. _4._ Lastly, the speaker 
decried our organized program of emergency help calling it "Civilian 
Defense". In 1950, Public Law 920 created Civil Defense 
(different from Civilian-groups of World War /2,), a responsibility 
of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property 
in disaster, natural or manmade.   Far from creating fear, 
as the speaker suggests, preparedness- knowing what to do in an emergency- 
gives people confidence. Civil Defense has far to go and 
many problems to solve, but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer 
tradition to be not only willing, but prepared to care for our own families 
and help our neighbors in any disaster- storm, flood, accident 
or even war? @ 

#PETS IN APARTMENTS#

It seems rather peculiar 
that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves 
with the protection and companionship of dogs. I feel that few 
burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment 
if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide. In 
addition, would not the young female public of Washington be afforded 
a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets 
if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?   I grant that 
the dog may not be really protective, based on his training, but if you 
were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady 
to molest, how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with 
a dog? I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners 
get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting 
dogs in apartments. @ 

#SIDEWALK CAFES#

Use the terraces of the 
Capitol for a sidewalk cafe? Could Senator Humphrey be serious 
in his proposal? Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists' 
comfort?   Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could 
be extended. The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak. 
Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel 
too far to eat? Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money 
to support themselves during the off season. As an added suggestion 
to balance the budget, the Government could sell advertising space 
on the Washington Monument. It is visible throughout the city, and 
men from Madison ave& would jump at the chance. @ #@#

Sen& 
Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart. He, like 
most of us, wants to be able to sit, to contemplate and be moved by 
the great outdoors. Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas 
around fountains and gardens. Let us, like the French, have outdoor 
cafes where we may relax, converse at leisure and enjoy the passing 
crowd. @ 

#DISSENTING VIEWS OF SENATORS#

Two strong dissents from 
the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee (May 2) by 
Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy 
of the Thirties did not work. 

#FOR A NEUTRAL GERMANY#

@ _SOVIETS SAID TO FEAR RESURGENCE OF 
GERMAN MILITARISM_ @ _TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ 
For the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large, 
powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional 
warfare of the past a nullity. The United States and Soviet 
Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations. Recent 
statements 
by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power 
of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient 
to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead 
of negotiations.   President Kennedy was right when he said, "We 
shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate". 
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and 
the Far East. It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe 
are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war. The 
fact is that the Italians, French and British know that they have 
no defense against nuclear bombs. We have no right to criticize them, 
as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war. 
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access 
into Berlin. It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to 
prevent us. But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from 
granting de facto recognition to East Germany. Soviet Russia has 
been invaded twice by German troops in a generation. In the last war 
Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories 
were devastated. _PROBABLE AGREEMENT_ The truth is that Communist 
Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism. Berlin is merely 
being used by Moscow as a stalking horse. Actually, the 
Communists, 
out of fear of a united and armed Germany, would probably be willing 
to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral 
and have its independence guaranteed by the U& N&.   If 
the Communists are sincere in wanting a united, neutral and disarmed 
Germany, it might well be advantageous for the German people in this 
nuclear age. It could provide security without cost of armaments and 
increase German prosperity and lessen taxation. France and other Western 
European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany. If the German 
people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following 
the example of Austria.   President Kennedy has urged a 
peace race on disarmament that might be called "Operation Survival" 
which has many facets. Why not make a beginning with a united and 
disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing 
would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States? 
A united Germany, freed of militarism, might be the first step toward 
disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world. @ 

#MEETING 
U& N& OBLIGATIONS#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK 
TIMES:_ In your editorial of Sept& 30 "The Smoldering Congo" 
you make the following comment: "Far too many states are following 
the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments. It 
is up to the Assembly to take action against them. They are violating 
their Charter obligation, the prescribed penalty for which is suspension 
of membership or expulsion".   I would like to quote from 
the Charter of the United Nations:   "Article 17, Section 
1: The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget 
of the Organization.   "Section 2: The expenses of the 
Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General 
Assembly.   "Article 19: A Member of the United Nations 
which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions 
to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if 
the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions 
due from it for the preceding two full years".   The U& 
S& S& R& and her followers are careful in paying their obligations 
to the regular budget. But they refuse, as do the Arab states, 
to support the United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United 
Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between 
Egypt and Israel, and the U& N& troops in the Congo, which 
expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations, 
but by a special budget.   According to the official interpretation 
of the Charter, a member cannot be penalized by not having the 
right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial 
obligations to the "special" United Nations' budgets, and of 
course cannot be expelled from the Organization (which you suggested 
in your editorial), due to the fact that there is no provision in the 
Charter for expulsion. @

@ _CONNALLY 
AMENDMENT'S REPEAL HELD STEP TOWARD WORLD ORDER_ @ _TO THE 
EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ In your Sept& 27 editorial appraisal 
of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress 
you referred to the lack of "consciousness of destiny in a time 
of acute national and world peril". Yet your list of things left 
undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's 
domestic jurisdiction reservation to its Adherence to the Statute 
of the International Court of Justice.   The Connally 
amendment says that the United States, rather than the court, shall
