sentences, were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions, perhaps because 
the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing 
activities.)   If a substitute mechanism is needed for the control 
of a fictitious impersonal market, quite obviously some method must 
be devised for representing the public interest. A secret conspiracy 
of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle. However, one can argue that 
no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust 
laws are effective and rational. Quite clearly the anti-trust laws 
are neither effective nor rational- and yet the argument goes that 
they should be extended to the labor union.   THOSE WHO 
favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating 
a brand new reform.   Before 1933, individuals who opposed 
trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English. 
The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934, 
implicit in the writing of Section 7~A of the National Industrial 
Recovery Act, has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining 
in principle. The Wagner Act, the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin 
Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.

The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system 
is the removal of wages from competition. If a union cannot perform 
this function, then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers 
as a gigantic fraud.   The tortured reasoning that unions 
use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply 
and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession. 
The problem must be faced squarely. If laborers are merely commodities 
competing against each other in a market place like so many bags 
of wheat and corn (unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural subsidy), 
then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism 
to a system that imposes such status upon them.   Human labor 
was exactly that- a commodity- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century 
America. As early as 1776, Adam Smith wrote in <The Wealth of 
Nations>: "We have no acts of Parliament against combining 
to lower the price of work; but many against combining to raise it". 
Eighteenth-century England, upon whose customs our common law was 
built, had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies. In 1825, 
the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced 
by the organized employers, who declared: "It is **h considered 
that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to **h effect 
the value of labor **h tend to convert all its branches into monopolies".

There were no pious hypocrisies then about being <for> 
collective bargaining, but <against> labor monopoly. The courts 
shared the opinion of the employers. In <People vs& Fisher>, Justice 
Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared:   "Without 
any officious and improper interference on the subject, the 
price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand 
for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid 
for it; but the right does not exist to raise **h the wages of the mechanic 
by any forced and artificial means".   Compare this statement 
of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin, according 
to the <Daily Labor Report> of Sept& 19, 1961, defends 
the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor 
"if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages, production or 
prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his 
employees to contract on wages, hours and conditions of employment".

Senator McClellan is proposing the application of anti-trust 
measures to unions in transportation. His bill, allegedly aimed at 
Hoffa, would amend the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts 
to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation 
strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert 
with any other union- even a sister local in the same international.

Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator McClellan was 
attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation, 
the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they 
met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action 
would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act. Indeed, it 
is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently 
granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws; for example, 
the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the 
encouragement of railroads to seek mergers. At the very moment that 
every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality 
of anti-trust legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective 
bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions 
who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that 
ship operators set freight rates. ##

THE passage of the 
Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies. It was most effective against 
trade unions. In the famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was 
brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices, 
e&g&, trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product 
of the struck manufacturer. The suit against the union was successful 
and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.

In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under 
the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be 
considered a commodity. The law could not suspend economics. Labor remained 
a commodity- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization 
from the anti-trust laws.   The courts, by interpretation, 
emasculated the act. In 1922, the United Mine Workers struck the 
Coronado Coal Company. The company sued under the anti-trust laws, 
alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of 
interstate commerce. (What other purpose could a striking union have 
but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?) The 
court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference 
with commerce. 

#THE NATION#


_THE THREE-FRONT WAR_ At a closed-door session 
on Capitol Hill last week, Secretary of State Christian Herter made 
his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 
U&S& affairs abroad. Afterward, Tennessee's Democratic Senator 
Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen. What Herter presented, 
said Gore, was "not a very encouraging review". That was something 
of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between 
the West and Communism erupted on three fronts. While Communists 
were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos, 
two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration 
into emergency conferences and serious decisions. _1) CUBA._ 
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery, Dictator 
Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U&S& with a blunt and 
drastic demand: within 48 hours, the U&S& had to reduce its 
embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons (the 
embassy staff alone totaled 87 U&S& citizens, plus 120 Cuban 
employees). President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a&m& meeting with 
top military and foreign-policy advisers, decided to break off diplomatic 
relations immediately. "There is a limit to what the United 
States in self-respect can endure", said the President. "That limit 
has now been reached".   Through Secretary Herter, Ike 
offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new 
Administration with the breakoff decision. Kennedy, through Secretary-designate 
of State Dean Rusk, declined. He thus kept his hands 
free for any action after Jan& 20, although reaction to the break 
was generally favorable in the U&S& and Latin America (<see> 
THE HEMISPHERE). _2) LAOS._ After a White House huddle 
between the President and top lieutenants, the Defense Department reacted 
sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that 
several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North 
Viet Nam. "In view of the present situation in Laos", said the 
Pentagon's announcement, "we are taking normal precautionary actions 
to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific". Cutting 
short a holiday at Hong Kong, the aircraft carriers <Lexington> 
and <Bennington> steamed off into the South China Sea, accompanied 
by a swarm of destroyers, plus troopships loaded with marines. 
On the U&S&'s island base of Okinawa, Task Force 116, made 
up of Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force units, got braced to move 
southward on signal.   But by week's end the Laotian cry of 
invasion was read as an exaggeration (<see> FOREIGN NEWS), and 
the U&S& was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies 
that a neutralist- rather than a pro-Western- government might 
be best for Laos. _FRENCH + INDIANS._ There was a moral of 
sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war 
fronts. Political, economic and military experts were all agreed that 
chaotic, mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world 
to fight a war- and they were probably right. "It would be like fighting 
the French and Indian War all over again", said one military 
man. But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?

At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-China settled, the 
British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands 
and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state, North Viet 
Nam- which then, predictably, became a base for Communist operations 
against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos. The late Secretary 
of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement 
a specimen of appeasement, saw that resolution would be needed to 
keep it from becoming a calamity for the West. He began the diplomatic 
discussions that resulted in the establishment of ~SEATO. 
"The important thing from now on", he said, "is not to mourn the 
past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern 
Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout 
Southeast Asia".   Russian tanks and artillery parading through 
the streets of Havana, Russian intrigue in the Congo, and Russian 
arms drops in Laos (using the same Ilyushin transports that were 
used to carry Communist agents to the Congo) made it plain once more 
that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time. Soviet Premier 
Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect 
Kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply. Considering the 
state of the whole world, the cold war's three exposed fronts did 
not seem terribly ominous; but, in Senator Gore's words, it was 
"not a very encouraging" situation that would confront John F& 
Kennedy on Inauguration Day. 

#THE CONGRESS#


_TURMOIL IN THE 
HOUSE_ As the 87th Congress began its sessions last week, liberal 
Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled 
by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal 
legislation to the floor. The liberal pressure bloc (which coyly 
masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group) had fought the 
committee before, and had always lost. This time, they were much better 
prepared and organized, and the political climate was favorable. 
They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy, whose own 
legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck. 
And counting noses, they seemed to have the votes to work their will. 

_DEADLY DEADLOCK._ There were two possible methods of breaching 
the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee: 1) to pack 
it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock, 
or 2) to remove one of the conservatives- namely Mississippi's 
14-term William Meyers Colmer (pronounced Calmer). Caucusing, the 
liberals decided to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic 
course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.
