foot traveler. Ball games, especially football, required some attention, 
and other organized sports may have attracted him as participant 
or spectator. He smoked, as did everybody, and imbibed the various alcoholic 
beverages of that day, although his protestations while at Cambridge 
and after that he was no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence 
from the wild drinking bouts of some of the undergraduates and, we 
must add, of some of their elders including many of the regents or teachers.

What manner of person does Milton appear to have been 
when as an undergraduate he resided at Christ's College? He was 
then a slightly built young man of pleasing appearance, medium stature, 
and handsome face. Graceful as his fencing and dancing lessons had 
taught him to be in addition to the natural grace of his slight, wiry 
frame, he cut enough of a figure to have evoked a nickname in the college, 
to which he himself referred in <Prolusion /6,: A quibusdam, 
audivi nuper Domina>. That is, if we can trust that most specious 
of prolusions, packed as it is with wit and persiflage. The <Domina> 
sounds real enough, if we could only trust the conditions under 
which we learn of its use; but anyone who would put much trust in any 
phase of <Prolusion /6,> except its illusive allusiveness deserves 
whatever fate may be meted out to him by virtue of the egregiously 
stilted banter. In short, the traditional epithet for Milton of 'Lady 
of Christ's', while eminently fitting, rests only on this 
baffling passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of writing 
Milton left us. Aubrey's mention of it (2:67, and Bodleian ~MS 
Aubr& 8, f& 63) comes from this prolusion, through Christopher 
Milton or Edward Phillips. It is not a question of truth or falsity; 
the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the 
epithet occurs is such a mass of intentionally buried allusions that 
almost nothing in it can be accepted as true- or discarded as false. 
The entire exercise, Latin and English, is most suggestive of the 
kind of person Milton had become at Christ's during his undergraduate 
career; the mere fact that he was selected, though as a substitute, 
to act as interlocutor or moderator for it, or perhaps we should say 
with Buck as 'father of the act', is in itself a difficult phase 
of his development to grasp. Milton was to act as the archfool, the 
supreme wit, the lightly bantering <pater, Pater Liber,> who could 
at once trip lightly over that which deserved such treatment, or could 
at will annihilate the common enemies of the college gathering, and 
with words alone. From an exercise involving merely raucous, rough-and-tumble 
comedy, in his hands the performance turned into a revel of 
wit and word play, indecent at times, but always learned, pointed, and 
carefully aimed at some individuals present, and at the whole assembly. 
To do this successfully required great skill and a special talent 
for both solemn and ribald raillery, a talent not bestowed on many persons, 
but one with which Milton was marked as being endowed and in which, 
at least in this performance, he obviously reveled. It may be thought 
unfortunate that he was called on entirely by accident to perform, 
if again we may trust the opening of the <oratio>, for it marks 
the beginning for us of his use of his peculiar form of witty word play 
that even in this Latin banter has in it the unmistakable element of 
viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally tormenting an 
adversary. But the real beginnings of this development in him go back 
to the opposing of grammar school, and probably if it had not been this 
occasion and these Latin lines it would have been some others, such 
as the first prolusion, that set off this streak in him of unbridled 
and scathing verbal attack on an enemy. All western Europe would hear 
and listen to him in this same vein about the middle of the century.

But these prolusions that we have surviving from the Christ's 
College days are only one phase of his existence then. Perhaps 
his most important private activity was the combination of reading, 
discussion with a few- if we can trust his writings to Diodati and 
the younger Gill, very few- congenial companions. Lines 23-36 of <Lycidas> 
later point to a friendship with Edward King, who entered 
Christ's College 9 June 1626. No other names among the young men 
in residence at the time seem to have been even suggested by Milton 
as those of persons with whom he in any way consorted. But that scarcely 
means that he was the aloof, forbidding type of student who shared 
few if any activities with his fellows, the banter of the surviving 
prolusions providing enough evidence to deny this. Apparently he was 
not a participant in the college or university theatricals, which he 
once attacked as utterly unworthy performances (see <Apology,> 3:300); 
but even in that famous passage, Milton was aiming not at the 
theatricals as such but at their performance by 'persons either enter'd, 
or presently to enter into the ministry'. The fact that he 
nowhere mentioned theatrical performances as part of the activities of 
the boys later in his hypothetical academy (1644) should not be taken 
too seriously as evidence that he desired them to eschew such performances. 
Perhaps, in that short piece or letter written to Hartlib in 
which he sketched his scheme for educating young men, he merely overlooked 
that phase of their exercises. 
Writers of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumptions 
that man can master the principles of this cause-and-effect universe 
and that such mastery will necessarily better the human lot. On 
the other hand, the bright vision of the future has been directly stated 
in science fiction concerned with projecting ideal societies- science 
fiction, of course, is related, if sometimes distantly, to that 
utopian literature optimistic about science, literature whose period 
of greatest vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries 
produced Edward Bellamy's <Looking Backward> and H& G& 
Wells's <A Modern Utopia>. In Arthur Clarke's <Childhood's 
End> (1953), though written after the present flood of dystopias 
began, we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly 
defined.   <Childhood's End>- apparently indebted to Kurd 
Lasswitz's utopian romance, <Auf Zwei Planeten> (1897), and 
also to Wells's histories of the future, especially <The World Set 
Free> (1914) and <The Shape of Things to Come> (1933)- 
describes 
the bloodless conquest of earth by the Overlords, vastly superior 
creatures who come to our world in order to prepare the human race for 
its next stage of development, an eventual merging with the composite 
mind of the universe. Arriving just in time to stop men from turning 
their planet into a radioactive wasteland, the Overlords unite earth 
into one world in which justice, order, and benevolence prevail and 
ignorance, poverty, and fear have ceased to exist. Under their rule, 
earth becomes a technological utopia. Both abolition of war and new 
techniques of production, particularly robot factories, greatly increase 
the world's wealth, a situation described in the following passage, 
which has the true utopian ring: "Everything was so cheap that 
the necessities of life were free, provided as a public service by 
the community, as roads, water, street lighting and drainage had once 
been. A man could travel anywhere he pleased, eat whatever he fancied- 
without handing over any money". With destructive tensions and 
pressures removed men have the vigor and energy to construct a new human 
life- rebuilding entire cities, expanding facilities for entertainment, 
providing unlimited opportunities for education- indeed, for 
the first time giving everyone the chance to employ his talents to the 
fullest. Mankind, as a result, attains previously undreamed of levels 
of civilization and culture, a golden age which the Overlords, a very 
evident symbol of science, have helped produce by introducing reason 
and the scientific method into human activities. Thus science is the 
savior of mankind, and in this respect <Childhood's End> only 
blueprints in greater detail the vision of the future which, though not 
always so directly stated, 
has nevertheless been present in the minds 
of most science-fiction writers.   Considering then the optimism 
which has permeated science fiction for so long, what is really remarkable 
is that during the last twelve years many science-fiction writers 
have turned about and attacked their own cherished vision of the future, 
have attacked the <Childhood's End> kind of faith that science 
and technology will inevitably better the human condition. And they 
have done this on a very large scale, with a veritable flood of novels 
and stories which are either dystopias or narratives of adventure 
with dystopian elements. Because of the means of publication- science-fiction 
magazines and cheap paperbacks- and because dystopian science 
fiction is still appearing in quantity the full range and extent 
of this phenomenon can hardly be known, though one fact is evident: 
the science-fiction imagination has been immensely fertile in its extrapolations. 
Among the dystopias, for example, Isaac Asimov's <The 
Caves of Steel> (1954) portrays the deadly effects on human life 
of the super-city of the future; James Blish's <A Case of Conscience> 
(1958) describes a world hiding from its own weapons of destruction 
in underground shelters; Ray Bradbury's <Fahrenheit 
451> (1954) presents a book-burning society in which wall television 
and hearing-aid radios enslave men's minds; Walter M& Miller, 
Jr&'s, <A Canticle for Leibowitz> (1959) finds men, after 
the great atomic disaster, stumbling back to their previous level of 
civilization and another catastrophe; Frederick Pohl's "The Midas 
Touch" (1954) predicts an economy of abundance which, in order 
to remain prosperous, must set its robots to consuming surplus production; 
Clifford D& Simak's "How-2" (1954) tells of a future 
when robots have taken over, leaving men nothing to do; and Robert 
Sheckley's <The Status Civilization> (1960) describes a world 
which, frightened by the powers of destruction science has given it, 
becomes static and conformist. A more complete list would also include 
Bradbury's "The Pedestrian" (1951), Philip K& 
Dick's 
<Solar Lottery> (1955), David Karp's <One> (1953), Wilson 
Tucker's <The Long Loud Silence> (1952), Jack Vance's 
<To Live Forever> 
(1956), Gore Vidal's <Messiah> (1954), and 
Bernard Wolfe's <Limbo> (1952), as well as the three perhaps most 
outstanding dystopias, Frederik Pohl and C& M& Kornbluth's 
<The Space Merchants> (1953), Kurt Vonnegut's <Player 
Piano> (1952), and John Wyndham's <Re-Birth> (1953), works which 
we will later examine in detail. The novels and stories like Pohl's 
<Drunkard's Walk> (1960), with the focus on adventure and 
with the dystopian elements only a dim background- in this case an 
uneasy, overpopulated world in which the mass of people do uninteresting 
routine jobs while a carefully selected, university-trained elite 
runs everything- are in all likelihood as numerous as dystopias.

There is, of course, nothing new about dystopias, for they belong 
to a literary tradition which, including also the closely related satiric 
utopias, stretches from at least as far back as the eighteenth century 
and Swift's <Gulliver's Travels> to the twentieth century 
and Zamiatin's <We,> Capek's <War with the Newts,> Huxley's 
<Brave New World,> E& M& Forster's "The Machine 
Stops", C& S& Lewis's <That Hideous Strength,> 
and Orwell's <Nineteen Eighty-Four,> and which in science fiction 
is represented 
before the present deluge as early as Wells's trilogy, <The 
Time Machine,> "A Story of the Days to Come", and <When 
the Sleeper Wakes,> and as recently as Jack Williamson's "With 
Folded Hands" (1947), the classic story of men replaced by their 
own robots. What makes the current phenomenon unique is that so 
many science-fiction writers have reversed a trend and turned to writing 
works critical of the impact of science and technology on human life. 
Since the great flood of these dystopias has appeared only in the 
last twelve years, it seems fairly reasonable to assume that the chief 
impetus was the 1949 publication of <Nineteen Eighty-Four,> an assumption 
which is supported by the frequent echoes of such details as 
Room 101, along with education by conditioning from <Brave New World,> 
a book to which science-fiction writers may well have returned 
with new interest after reading the more powerful Orwell dystopia.

Not all recent science fiction, however, is dystopian, for the 
optimistic strain is still very much alive in <Mission of Gravity> 
and <Childhood's End,> as we have seen, as well as in many other
