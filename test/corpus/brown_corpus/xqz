the one, you'd better take both".   Brannon shook his head. 
"I won't force Beth to come against her will. But I'm going 
to have my son".   They were silent for a little while, each 
looking glum.   Finally Luis Hernandez said, "What must be, 
must be. I am with you, of course, Tomas".   And Hank Maguire 
added, "So am I, Tom".   "All right", Brannon said, 
rising. "We'll ride out as soon as we've had chuck". ## 

Brannon timed it so that they rode in an hour after nightfall. They 
had for cover both darkness and a summer storm. During much of the 
fifteen-mile ride they had watched a lurid display of lightning in the 
sky to the east. Later, they'd heard the rumble of thunder and then, 
just outside Rockfork, they ran into rain. Those who had slickers 
donned them. The others put on old coats or ducking jackets, whichever 
they carried behind their saddle cantles.   There were seven 
of them, enough for a show of strength- to run a bluff. It was to 
be nothing more than that. There was to be no gunplay. If the bluff 
failed and they ran into trouble, Brannon had told the others, they 
would withdraw- and he would come after his son another time. He didn't 
want to put himself outside the law.   With him were Hank 
Maguire, Luis Hernandez, and Luis's son Pedro. The Ramirez 
brothers were also along. The seventh man was Red Hogan, a wiry little 
puncher with a wild streak and a liking for hell-raising. They were 
all good men.   It was dark early, because of the storm. Also 
because of the storm, the streets of Rockfork were deserted. Lighted 
windows glowed jewel-bright through the downpour. They reined in 
before the town marshal's office, a box-sized building on Main Street. 
A lamp burned inside, but Brannon, peering through the window, 
saw that the office was empty. He'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin 
there.   "Probably just stepped out", he said. "Maybe to 
have supper. Red, come along. The rest of you wait here".   With 
Red Hogan, he rode to the Welcome Cafe. Hogan got down from 
the saddle and had a look inside. "Not there", he said, getting back 
onto his horse. "Maybe he's at the hotel".   They rode 
to the Rockfork House, a little farther along the opposite side of 
the street. They reined in there, Brannon remaining in the saddle while 
Hogan went to look for Jesse Macklin in the hotel dining room. 
Brannon had no slicker. He'd put on his old brown corduroy coat and 
it was already soaked. But he felt no physical discomfort. He was 
only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain. He hardly noticed the blue-green 
flashes of lightning and the hard claps of thunder.   Hogan 
reappeared, stopped on the hotel porch, lifted a hand in signal. Brannon 
dismounted and climbed the steps.   "He's finished eating", 
Hogan said. "Sitting with a cup of coffee now. It shouldn't 
be long".   It seemed long, at least to Tom Brannon. He 
and Hogan waited by the door, one to either side. Macklin was the 
third man to come out, and he came unhurriedly. He was puffing on a cigar, 
and he was turning up his coat collar against the rain. It was 
not until he moved across the porch that he became aware of them, and 
then it was too late. They closed in fast, kept him from reaching inside 
his coat for his gun.   "Just come along", Brannon told 
him. "Don't start anything you can't finish".   "Now, 
listen"- Macklin began.   "We'll talk over at your office".

"Brannon, I warn you"! "Let's go, Marsh 
al", Brannon said, and took him by the arm.   Hogan gripped the 
lawman's other arm. They escorted him down from the porch and through 
the rain to his office. The other five Slash-B men followed them 
inside, crowding the small room. His face was stiff with anger when 
they let go of his arms. He looked at each of them in turn, Brannon 
last of all.   "I'll remember you", he said. "Every 
last one of you. As for you, Brannon"-   "Put your gun on 
the desk, Marshal".   "Now, hold on, damn it; I won't"-

Red Hogan's patience ran out. He lifted the skirt 
of Macklin's coat, took his gun from its holster, tossed it onto the 
desk. "Too much fooling around", he said. "Don't press your 
luck, badge-toter".   Brannon said, "Now the key to the lockup, 
Marshal".   "Key"? Macklin said. "What for"?

"Can't you guess"? Brannon said. "We're putting 
you where you won't come to harm. Come on- the key. Get it 
out"!   "Damned if I will. Brannon, you've assaulted a 
law officer and"-   They moved in on him, crowded him from 
all sides. No man laid a hand on him, but the threat of violence was 
there. His face took on a sudden pallor, became beaded with sweat, and 
he seemed to have trouble with his breathing. He held out a moment 
longer, then his nerve gave under the pressure.   He swore, and 
said, "All right. It's here in my pocket".   "Get it out", 
Brannon ordered. Then, as Macklin obeyed: "Now let's 
go out 
back".   Resignedly, Macklin turned to the back door. They 
followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty 
feet to the rear. The door of the lockup was of oak planks and banded 
with strap iron. It was secured by an oversized padlock. Macklin 
balked again, not wanting to unlock and open the door. They crowded 
him in that threatening way once more, forced him to give in. Once the 
door was open, they crowded him inside the dark building. He was uttering 
threats in a low but savage voice when they closed and padlocked 
the door.   They returned to the street, mounted their horses, 
rode through the rain to the big house on Houston Street. Its windows 
glowed with lamplight. Deputy Marshal Luke Harper still stood 
guard on the veranda, a forlorn, scarecrowish figure in the murky dark. 
He came to the edge of the veranda, peered down at them with his hand 
on his gun.   "Don't try it", Brannon told him, dismounting 
and starting up the steps with his men following. "Don't get 
yourself killed for something that doesn't concern you". 
He strode past the now frightened man, entered the house. Miguel and 
Arturo Ramirez remained on the veranda to keep Harper from interfering. 
The others followed Brannon inside. They trailed him across 
the wide hallway to the parlor, four roughly garbed and tough-looking 
men who probably had never before ventured into such a house. They brought 
to it all the odors that clung to men like themselves, that of their 
own sweat, of campfire smoke, of horses and cattle. They tracked 
mud on the oaken floor, on the carpet. Their presence fouled the elegance 
of that room.   And their arrival caught John Clayton and 
Charles Ansley off guard.

The author of the anonymous notes seemed to be all-knowing. For 
men who had left cattle alone after getting their first notices had 
received no second. But the day of the deadline came and passed, and 
the men who had scoffed at the warnings laughed with satisfaction. For, 
with a single exception, nothing had happened to them.   The 
exception was an Iron Mountain settler named William Lewis. After 
walking out to his corral that morning, he'd been amazed to see the 
dust puff up in front of his feet. A split second later, the distant 
crack of a rifle had sounded. He'd mounted up immediately and raced 
with a revolver ready toward the spot from which he'd estimated the 
shot had come. But he had found all of the thickets and points of 
cover deserted. There had been no sign of a rifleman and no track or 
trace to show that anyone had been near.   Lewis was a man who had 
made a full-time job of cow stealing. He hadn't even pretended to 
be farming his spread. His land had never been plowed. He had done 
his rustling openly and boasted about it. He had received both first 
and second anonymous notices, and each time he had accused his neighbors 
of writing them. He had cursed at them and threatened them. He was 
a man, those neighbors testified later, who didn't have a friend 
in the world.   William Lewis made the rounds of all who lived 
near him again, that August morning after a bullet landed at his feet, 
and once more he accused and threatened everyone.   "I'll 
be ready next time"! he raged. "I'll be shootin' right back".

He had his chance the very next morning, for exactly the 
same thing happened again. This time Lewis had his own rifle in his 
hands, and he threw some answering fire back at the mysterious far-off 
shot, then spent most of the day searching out the area. He found nothing, 
but he still refused to give up and move out.   "Just 
let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin' coward face-to-face"! 
he exploded. "That's all I ask"!   He never got that 
chance. For the unseen, ghostlike rifleman aimed a little higher the 
third time. A .30-30 bullet smashed directly into the center of William 
Lewis' chest. He slumped against a log fence rail, then tried 
to lift himself. Two more shots followed in quick succession, dropping 
him limp and huddled on the ground.   An inquest was held, and 
after a good deal of testimony about the anonymous notes, the county 
coroner estimated that the shooting had been done from a distance of 
300 yards. Rumors of the offer Tom Horn had made at the Stockgrowers' 
Association meeting had leaked out by then, and as a grand jury 
investigation of the murder got underway, the prosecuting attorney, 
a Colonel Baird, ordered that the tall stock detective be summoned for 
questioning.   It took some time to locate Horn. He was finally 
found in the Bates Hole region of Natrona County, two counties 
away. Prosecutor Baird immediately assumed he was hiding out there 
after the shooting and began preparing an indictment. But that indictment 
was never made. For Tom Horn, it turned out, had a number of 
rancher and cowboy witnesses ready and willing to swear with straight 
faces that he had been in Bates Hole the day of the killing. 
The former scout's alibi couldn't be shaken. The authorities had 
to release him. He immediately rode on to Cheyenne, threw a ten-day 
drinking spree and dropped some very strong hints among friends.

"Dead center at three hundred yards, that coroner said"! he'd 
grin. "Three shots in that fella 'fore he hit the ground! You 
reckon there's two men in this state can shoot like that"?

Publicly, he denied everything. Privately, he created and magnified 
an image of himself as a hired assassin. For a blood-chilling ring 
of terror to the very sound of his name was the tool he needed for 
the job he'd promised to do. ##

Tom Horn was soon back at work, 
giving his secret employers their money's worth. A good many beef-hungry 
settlers were accepting the death of William Lewis as proof 
that the warning notes were not idle threats. The company herds were 
being raided less often, and cabins and soddies all over the range were 
standing deserted. But there were other homesteaders who passed the 
Lewis murder off as a personal grudge killing, the work of one of his 
neighbors. The rustling problem was by no means solved.   Even 
in the very area where the shooting had been done, cattle were still 
disappearing. For less than a dozen miles from the unplowed land of 
the dead man lived another settler who had ignored the warnings that his 
existence might be foreclosed on- a blatant and defiant rustler named 
Fred Powell.   "Fred was mighty crude about the way he 
took in cattle" his own hired man, Andy Ross, mentioned later. 
"Everyone knew it, but he sort of acted like he didn't care 
who knew it- even after them notes came, even after he'd heard about 
Lewis, even after he'd been shot at a couple o' times hisself"!

On the morning of September 10, 1895, Powell and Ross 
rose at dawn and began their day's work. Haying time was close at 
hand, and they needed some strong branches to repair a hay rack. Harnessing 
a team to a buckboard, they drove out to a willow-lined creek 
about a half-mile off, then climbed down and began chopping.   Andy 
Ross had just started swinging an ax at his second willow when the 
distant blast of a rifle sounded. He looked around in surprise, then 
noticed that Fred Powell was clutching his chest. The hired man 
ran over to help his boss.   "My God, I'm shot"! Powell 
gasped. And he collapsed and died instantly.   Ross had no 
intention of searching for the assassin. He heaved the dead man onto 
the buckboard, yelled and lashed at the team and got out of there fast.
