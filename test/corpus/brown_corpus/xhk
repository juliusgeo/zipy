The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, 
as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar 
social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation. 
(Co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to 
fill a vacancy; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power 
from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.) In a 
mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of 
recruitment; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of 
economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation; therefore, 
the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation 
rather than proclamation- like elements will have to be assimilated.

Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been 
carefully studied in the churches; one study in Pittsburgh, however, 
has illuminated the situation. In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh 
churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial "contacts 
with friendly members". If we add to these contacts with friendly 
members the "contacts with an organization of the church" (11.2 
per cent of the cases), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment 
is through friendly contact. On the surface, this seems a sound 
approach to Christian mission: members of the congregation show by 
their friendly attitudes that they care for new people; the new people 
respond in kind by joining the church.   Missionary outreach 
by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what 
is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods; the majority 
of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic 
position; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle 
of informal relations. This means that the antennae of the congregation 
are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths 
of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation; 
the mission of the church is actually a process of informal 
co-optation; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people 
who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation. 
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long 
as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people 
who can fit the pattern of economic integration; once the pool of recruits 
diminishes, the congregation is helpless- friendly contacts no 
longer keep it going.   The transmutation of mission to co-optation 
is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, 
worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members. The 
proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts 
by the clergy (17.3 per cent of new members) and friendly contacts 
by members (over two thirds if organizational activities are included). 
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with 
new members. In general, friendly contact with a member followed by 
contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment 
by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic 
integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission 
in the contemporary church; economic integration and co-optation are 
the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from 
the neighborhood. The inner life of congregations will prosper so long 
as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize 
together; the outer life of congregations- the suitability 
of the environment to their survival- will be propitious so long as 
the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the 
membership. Economic integration ceases when the social and economic 
statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of 
the congregation. In a rapidly changing society congregations will run 
into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration 
are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single 
generation. The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations 
have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred 
years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle 
to maintain economic balance. The expense of this type of organization 
in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which 
deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental 
questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile 
society; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations 
illumines the nature of the Protestant development. 
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had 
split into two trends- expanding interdependence on an impersonal 
basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings. These trends 
seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis. Residential 
associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions. 
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential 
communities have polarized; the schism between central city and suburb, 
Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as 
symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis. 
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved 
with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize 
the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings. 
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the 
drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations. This 
conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable 
environment. More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the 
churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan 
life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of 
peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world 
of heterogeneous peoples.   Since American life is committed 
above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the 
countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have 
fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence 
of the metropolis. Consumer communities have suffered at the hands 
of the productive interests. Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural 
newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities. Soon they will 
fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches 
will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized 
their history for a century. The identification of the basic unit 
of religious organization- the parish or congregation- with a 
residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply 
means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian 
fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation. Mission 
to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential 
community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan 
interdependence with residential exclusion.   This interpretation 
of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could 
lead to various projections for the churches. It could be argued 
that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed 
to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the 
middle classes. It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain 
religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities. 
Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational 
and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the 
social identity of middle-class people.   Attention will be given 
in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational 
churches; this style is characteristically an expression of the 
communal style of the middle classes. The keynotes of this style are 
activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem. These 
values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating 
the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community 
participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of 
middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major 
denominations. "Fellowship by likeness" and "mission by friendly 
contact" form the iron cage of denominational religion. Its contents 
are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued 
by the congregation. What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention 
under the rubric of the organization church. An understanding 
of the new role of residential association in an industrial society 
serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of 
conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.

The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes 
turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs 
and charities should fill the same need. 
With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course 
to pursue.   The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who 
had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company. 
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt 
with the Indians through <engages>, who might be <habitants, voyageurs>, 
or even soldiers. The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of 
one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to 
company stores and shipped to France in company ships. The company 
disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.

In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish 
presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians. The lavish 
use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade 
of New France and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change 
in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men. Traders 
from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty 
turned to them. Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded, 
and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian 
insurrections that brought ruin to the company.   In 1721 
the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do 
all that was necessary to protect the colony. They ordered the raising 
of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts. They 
adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts. 
In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading 
depot to supply the smaller trading houses. For southeastern 
Louisiana, 
Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies 
for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British 
traders. Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending 
northward to the sources of the Tennessee River. Fort Toulouse, 
on the Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas 
and Choctaws, but money was available for only one other new 
post, near the present Nashville, Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.

West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi 
district, of which New Orleans was headquarters. Dependent upon it 
were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers 
of New Spain.   On the middle Mississippi a principal 
post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas. It was hoped 
that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west, 
principally down the Arkansas River. On the Ohio or Wabash was to 
be built another post "at the fork of two great rivers". Other 
posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication 
with Canada. On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was 
to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built 
on the Missouri, "where there are mines in abundance". 
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible 
to a director-general at New Orleans. An elaborate system of accounting 
and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the 
most scientific way. Concessionaires were to be under the supervision 
of the directors. <Engages> must be loyal to the concessionaires, 
and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended. 
The <habitants> were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose 
of their pelts to the concessionaires.   Only two principal storehouses 
were actually established- one at Mobile, the other at New 
Orleans. New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi, 
and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash. Mobile 
was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district.

The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration 
cannot be determined. Regulations for the Indian trade were 
made by the <Conseil superieure de la Louisiane>, and Bienville 
apparently did not have control of that body. The <Conseil> even 
treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and, 
on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise "suitable 
for the peltry trade". It decided, also, that the purely secular
