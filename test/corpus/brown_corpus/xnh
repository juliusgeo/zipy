
#SOURCES OF INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN#

Successful teaching 
involves getting enough information about each pupil to understand 
why he behaves as he does in certain situations and how his achievement 
in school is being influenced by various factors in his environment. 
The classroom teacher cannot be expected to be as proficient in the 
use of the techniques of child study as the clinical psychologist; 
he cannot be expected to administer all the tests and gather all the information 
needed about each child in his classroom. He can be expected, 
however, to examine and interpret the information already available; 
to refine and extend his own techniques for studying individual children; 
and to utilize opportunities, arising in connection with regular 
classroom activities, for gaining a better understanding of his 
pupils. This section deals with some of the sources of information that 
can be tapped by the classroom teacher; Chapter 15 provides more 
detailed information about specific techniques used in evaluating pupil 
progress. _CUMULATIVE RECORDS_ Most school systems today maintain 
a system of cumulative records of pupils. These records, when systematically 
maintained, provide much information about the children, which 
the teacher can use in guidance, instruction, grouping, and reporting 
to parents. Each teacher has in his classroom a metal file, equipped 
with a lock, which is used to store cumulative record folders. During 
summer vacation periods these records are stored in the office of 
the principal. Only the teacher and other professional personnel are 
permitted to see or use these records. Each new teacher to whom the 
pupil goes is expected to study the information in the cumulative record 
and to bring it up to date. Some school systems provide written instructions 
to principals and teachers designating when certain information 
is to be recorded on cumulative record forms and explaining how 
the information is to be summarized and used.

THE SUMMARY REPORT ON DESEGREGATION PROGRESS IN EDUCATION IN 
THE MIDDLE-SOUTH REGION, 1959-1960" clearly shows two pieces of 
information. The Summary Report, which was prepared for this Conference, 
indicates, first, that actual or pending school desegregation is 
increasing; second, that both actual and pending desegregation is, 
with few exceptions, the product or result of court order. The Report 
together with other information suggests that desegregation in the 
schools is slow.   The Middle-South Region, as defined by the 
National Association of Intergroup Relations Officials (~NAIRO), 
consists of the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Tennessee, West 
Virginia, Delaware, Virginia and the District of Columbia. The 
states and the Nation's Capital all have some desegregation, in 
fact some dating back to 1954; but the region also embraces some of 
the staunchest opposition. Desegregation has been opposed by massive 
resistance, interposition, pupil assignment (with no assignments of 
Negro children), and hate bombings. 

#DESEGREGATION AND COURT ORDER# 

Now let's look at the evidence that shows the increase in desegregation 
and such increase as a result of court order. First <Kentucky>. 
Elementary school desegregation came to Owen and Union Counties, 
which already had high school desegregation. The action was a result 
of a court order, the citation for which (and for other court action 
mentioned in this paper) is taken from the Summary Report for this 
Conference. In <Maryland> the Harford County Board of Education 
had prepared a desegregation plan which the Court approved but 
which a plaintiff had challenged; thus, county school board and Federal 
court joined hands here to promote school desegregation.   Additional 
school desegregation in <Tennessee> resulted from a court 
order opening a school serving children of military personnel. Similarly, 
further desegregation may come from suits pending in three Tennessee 
cities, Chattanooga, Knoxville, and Memphis. In <West Virginia> 
the number of white and Negro children attending the same school 
has increased almost twofold. There are no court decisions here.

As in Maryland, a District court has approved an official plan 
of school desegregation in <Delaware>. As a result of the State 
Board of Education plan, Negro children entered heretofore white 
elementary schools in five districts. The Third Circuit Court of 
Appeals is reviewing an appeal from the plan.   In <Virginia> 
court orders led to desegregation in Charlottesville and Floyd Counties. 
Desegregation in Pulaski County is pending because of court 
order, although date of admission is not yet determined. Negro parents 
have filed application for admission of additional children to schools 
in Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, and Warren Counties. Desegregation 
can also result from additional suits brought by Negro plaintiffs 
against school boards in Newport News, Fairfax County, Arlington 
County, and Norfolk.   As a school district, the <District 
of Columbia> has had desegregated schools since 1954, shortly 
after the Supreme Court decision.   This recapitulation makes 
it clear that school desegregation continues, including the Old Dominion 
State, in spite of its stern resistance. The record is clear that 
increase in school desegregation last year came largely as a result 
of a court order; that on the immediate horizon, if further large-scale 
(relatively speaking) desegregation comes, it will result from court 
orders on suits filed in several Middle-South states. Knowledge 
that thousands of school districts are involved and observation that 
school desegregation has occurred in only a handful in 1959-1960 leads 
to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order is slow. 
Before turning to my views as to the problems and issues before us at 
this Regional Conference, I wish to note a small item in the Summary 
Report as it refers to the District of Columbia. That reference 
in the Report is "continuation of the trend toward an all-Negro 
school system", a remark apparently occasioned by the increase of Negro 
school population from 74.1 per cent to 76.7 per cent. I see no 
real prospects for an all-Negro school population. West of Rock Creek 
Park is still monolithically white and is in fact increasingly white 
as a result of Georgetown's conversion-by-renovation housing program. 
Nearby Foggy Bottom is ousting Negroes. The large acreage 
in the Southwest Redevelopment area beckons white people- what with 
high-priced town houses and elevator apartments. The Capitol Hill 
rehabilitation, like Foggy Bottom, replaces Negroes with whites (but 
also replaces some whites with other whites).   The sharpest 
break with tradition, the past and present of "White Ring Around 
a Black Core", may come with the opening of nearby Montgomery County 
suburbs to Negro residents and, presumably, the consequent conclusion 
of some whites that they cannot escape the Negro by fleeing to 
the suburbs. In fact, short of fleeing to Warrenton, Virginia, or Rockville, 
Maryland, white people may have to live with Negroes. All 
of this must be taken into account before the image of an "all-Negro" 
D&C& public school system is conjured up. 

#PROBLEMS TO 
SOLVE#

From the Summary Report before us at this Conference, a number 
of problems are apparent. They vex us and perplex us but generally 
do not divide us like the issues which follow the problems. 
First, how can we step up the desegregation movement? It is slow. 
I believe we all want more schools where white and Negro together 
can and do attend. I believe we all want no child denied admission to 
a school on account of his color. In general, members of ~NAIRO 
would certainly want a child admitted to a school nearest his residence 
or within his residence zone. How to achieve this objective is 
a problem, but we are not divided on what we want.   Second, as 
we increase the number of desegregated school districts and schools themselves, 
how can we achieve this action through school board action? 
It may be county school board or state school board action, as well 
as that of municipal school boards. Correlatively, can we reduce the 
role of the district courts, so that the action is that of the people 
of the community or other school district and not that of the law court? 
This is a problem, and I believe there is little difference of 
opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and 
effect a plan of desegregation.   Third, how can we insure a systematic 
and continuing group relations education in the schools? Not 
simply a brief program when the schools are actually desegregated but 
a continuing program that also promotes integration, that encourages 
the children and teachers not to look at each other as white or Negro, 
but as human beings. Again the problem is how to get it done and 
in what form to offer the group relations education; not whether it 
should be done.   Fourth, in the segregated school system, during 
the period before desegregation, how can we assure equal opportunity? 
In fact, in the desegregated school system which may have a good 
many schools with all-Negro population, how can we assure equal opportunity? 
This is a problem, but we are not divided over its importance 
or by its existence.   Fifth, in the segregated school system 
or in the all-Negro or all-white schools, how can we encourage better 
group relations or an improved attitude toward people who do not belong 
to the group? Can we help children adjust to "images of other 
children" when the latter are not actually present. 

#NOW, THE ISSUES# 

If we have five problems whose solution we seek in relatively 
united fashion, then there are twice as many issues which, I judge, sharply 
divide us, intergroup relations practitioners and lay people. _ISSUE 
NO& 1. PUPIL ASSIGNMENT._ Since on the one hand school 
desegregation 
has come in Virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment, shall 
we support the plan? On the basis of pupil assignment criteria, 
Judge Albert Bryan has assigned Negro children to formerly white 
schools in Arlington and Alexandria, Virginia. Shall we support pupil 
assignment? On the other hand, looking at the larger picture, 
is it true that pupil assignment has effectively cut off, blocked, or 
reduced school desegregation to a "trickle"? Shall we therefore 
oppose the plan? This question is an issue because it likely divides 
us into two camps- those for or against pupil assignment. _ISSUE 
NO& 2. 
TEACHER ASSIGNMENT IN ORDER TO DESEGREGATE._ In large cities 
like Baltimore, Louisville, and Washington, D&C&, should school 
desegregation be extended to all-Negro and all-white schools by 
assigning white and Negro teachers, respectively? On the one hand 
do we argue the Supreme Court decision required only that a <child> 
not be denied admission to a school on account of his race? Or should 
we argue that if we want adjustment of children to children of different 
races and that that is impossible in an all-something-or-the-other 
school, we must at least provide him some opportunity to adjust 
to people of another race within the school namely, to a teacher of another 
race. We can argue that where residence makes pupil desegregation 
impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated 
situation. _ISSUE NO& 3. 
THE PLAINTIFF IN SCHOOL DESEGREGATION CASES._ 
The earlier part of my statement deals with the court orders that 
resulted in desegregation. In each instance the plaintiff was a private 
citizen. In thousands of school districts, indeed, in the entire 
State of Mississippi, no plaintiff has come forth. And I have established 
that the action of municipal, county, or state school boards 
or boards of education is small, infinitesimally small in comparison 
with the number of districts. Is the requirement that the plaintiff be 
a person actually denied admission to a school a sound requirement? 
Should Congress authorize the Attorney General to file suit to accomplish 
admission of a child to a school to which he is denied entrance? 
Even though in civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision 
for the Attorney General to act was eliminated, should we 
nevertheless 
support such a clause? This is an issue, for it divides
