It would summon him once; if he missed it, never again. What 
if it came when he was playing, or was asleep and dreaming?

He must not fail to hear it. He was Papa's chosen; therefore, 
nothing but good could happen to him, even in God's wrathful storms. 
When the skies grew dark and thunder rolled across the valley, he 
was unafraid. Aggie might fly into a closet, shut the door and bury her 
head in the clothes; he dared to wait for the lightning.   Lightning 
could strike you blind if you were a sinner! But he was good. 
He clenched his fists and faced the terror. Thunder crashed; 
barrels tumbled down the mountainsides, and bounced and bounced till their 
own fury split them open. Lightning might strike the steeples of 
the other churches; not of Drew Church. A flash illumined the trees 
as a crooked bolt twigged in several directions. Violet whinnied 
from the stable.   He ran out into the downpour, sped across the 
yard and into the buggy room. "Don't be afraid, Violet"! he 
shouted, and was aghast at the echoes. "Don't you be afraid"! 
He would save her. If there was a fire or a flood he would save Mama 
first and Violet next. Drenched and shaking, he stood near the sweet-smelling 
stall and dared to pat her muzzle. "Don't you be afraid, 
Violet"!   After the storm, the sky cleared blue and cool, 
and fragrant air swept the hills. When the sun came out, Stevie 
strode proudly into Orange Square, smiling like a landlord on industrious 
tenants. The fountain had brimmed over, the cannon were wet, the 
soldiers' monument glistened. Even before the benches had dried, 
the Civil War veterans were straggling back to their places. The great 
spire shone as if the lightning had polished it. He jumped. The 
pointed shadow had nearly touched him.   He trailed Ludie to the 
baseball game in the lot on Kingston Street near the Dutch Reformed.

"Go on home"! Ludie screeched at him. "Someone'll 
tell Papa"!   No one told on Ludie, not even when he 
slipped live grasshoppers into the mite-box. Ludie did as he pleased.

Ludie took his slingshot and climbed to the rooftop to shoot 
at 
crows. Ludie chewed roofer's tar. Ludie had a cigar box full of 
marbles and shooters, and a Roman candle from last Fourth of July. 
Ludie hopped rides on freight cars, and was chased by Mr& Yankton, 
the railroad guard. He came home overheated, ran straight to the ice-chest, 
and gulped shivery cold water.   Stevie envied him. That 
Ludie! He, too, cocked his cap at a jaunty angle, jingled marbles 
in his pocket, and swaggered down Main Street. On the Christophers' 
lawn, little girls in white pinafores were playing grownups at 
a tea party. A Newfoundland sat solemnly beside a doghouse half his 
size. Stevie yearned for a dog. He wondered whether God had a dog in 
the sky.   He meandered down Pike Street, past the First National 
Bank with its green window shades. He crossed the tracks to 
Delaware House, where ladies in gay dresses and men in straw boaters 
and waxed mustaches crowded the verandah. A tall lady, with a ruffled 
collar very low on her bosom, turned insolent green eyes upon him. She 
was taller than Aggie. She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth 
and haughty air that she had to be wicked. Fiddles screeched; a piano 
tinkled.   "P& J&"- as Ludie called the town- was 
crowded with summer people who came to the mountains to escape the 
heat in the big cities. They stayed at hotels and boardinghouses, or 
at private homes. Rich people went to Delaware House, Opera House, 
American House or Fowler House. 
<If the crummy bastard could write!> That's how it should be. 
<It's those two fucken niggers! Krist, I wish they could write!> 
Nigger pussy. He thought of sweet wet nigger pussy. <Oh, 
sweet 
land of heaven, haint there just nothin like sweet nigger pussy!> 
He thought of her, the first one. He had caught her coming out of the 
shack. She was a juicy one. <Oh how they bounced!> Fresh, warm, 
sweet and juicy, sweet lovin sixteen, she was. <Man how I love 
nigger pussy!> The snow came a little faster now, he noted. He thought 
of Joe Harris, the nigger who had gone after his sister. He chuckled, 
the memory vivid. <Jee- sus, We Fixed him! Yooee, we 
fixed him!> The snow again. <If only the fucken weather wasn't 
so lousy! Goddamn niggers, Lord. What I have to put up with! 
Sonuvabitch, I can't figure out what in hell for they went and put 
niggers in my squad for. Only one worth a shit, and that's Brandon. 
He ain't so bad> **h   His thoughts turned to other things 
**h The big shock everybody had when they found ol Slater and those 
others done for. <Kaboom for>.   He had been pretty scared 
himself, wondering what the hell was coming off. But he soon saw which 
way the ball was bouncing. Soon came back to his senses. "I soon 
came back to my senses", he said, aloud, to the young blizzard, proudly, 
drawing himself up, as if making a report to some important superior 
**h <I was the first to get my squad on the ball, and anybody 
thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb. Look at thum. That goddamn 
redheader was the worst. He kept sayin, not me, not me, I don't wanta 
wind up like em. But I told him, goddammit>. "I told him", 
he said aloud **h <They'll get the guys that done it. That'll 
put the place back to normal>. Normal, <by God. Maybe it's a good 
thing it happened. Maybe they'll stop it now, once for all. Clean 
the place up. They're doin it now. I hear the whole bunch is croakin 
out in the snow>. They'll get the guys that done it **h There 
was something troubling him though: as yet <they hadn't> **h 
Five days **h <Keerist> **h Prickly twinges of annoyance ran through 
him. His eyes blinked hard, snapping on and squashing some bad things 
that were 
trying to push their way into him. A tune began to whirl 
inside his head. One of his favorites: "Guitar Boogie". It 
always came on, faithfully, just like a radio or juke box, whenever he 
started to worry too much about something, when the bad things tried 
to push their way into him. The music drove them off, or away, and he 
was free to walk on air in a very few moments, humming and jiving within, 
beating the rhythm within. He glowed with anticipation about what 
would happen to the culprits when they caught them **h <Turn the 
bastards over to me- to me and my boys- no nigger ever got what would 
be comin to them>- reactionary bastards **h. He had never heard 
the word reactionary before his life as a ~POW began. It was 
a word he was proud of, a word that meant much to him, and he used it 
with great pleasure, almost as if it were an exclusive possession, and 
more: he sensed himself to be very highly educated, four cuts above 
any of the folks back home **h "<Four cuts at least>", he chuckled 
to himself, "<and I owe it all to them>". The word also 
made him feel hate, sincere hate, for those so labeled. He used it very 
effectively when he wanted to get his squad on the ball. It came up 
again and again in the discussion sessions **h <Lousy Reactionary 
bastards been tryin to fuck up the Program for months. Months. Hired, 
hard lackeys of the Warmongering Capitalists. Not captured, sent 
here. To fuck up the Program. You guys remember that. Remember that> 
**h He heard himself haranguing them. He saw himself before them 
delivering the speech. He laughed, suddenly, feeling a surge of power 
telling him of his hold over them, seeing himself before them, receiving 
utmost respect and attention. One day, Ching had told him (smiling, 
patting him on the back) as they walked to the weekly conference 
of squad leaders, "Keep it up, your squad is good, one of the best, 
keep it up, keep up the good work". He would! That was really 
something, coming from Ching **h "Really something", he said, aloud 
**h <Dirty Reactionary bastards comin down here in the night and 
bumpin off ol Slater and those other poor bastards>. "They'll 
get them by God and let them bring them down here to me, just let them, 
God I'll slice their balls right off **h" His arm moved swiftly, 
violently, once, twice. He felt intense satisfaction. He was 
tingling within. Before him, mutilated, bleeding to death, they lay. 
It was as if it had been done. "Bastards", he said aloud, spitting 
on them. He halted, and looked around. Rivers of cold sweat were 
suddenly unleashed within him. The thought came back, the one nagging 
at him these past four days. He tried to stifle it. But the words were 
forming. He knew he couldn't. He braced himself **h <Somebody'll 
hafta start thinkin> **h He fought it, seeking to kill the last 
few words, but on they came **h <bout takin>- <his> **h He was 
trembling, a strange feeling upon him, fully expecting some catastrophe 
to strike him dead on the spot. But it didn't. And he took heart; 
the final word came forth **h <place> **h Now he heard it, fully: 
"**h <bout takin his place> **h" He listened, waited, nothing 
happened. He felt good. His old self. The music arrived, taking 
him **h its rhythm stroked him, snaked all through him, the lyrics 
lifted him, took him from one magic isle to another, stopping briefly 
at each **h <Brandon. He is good. Damn good. But a nigger. Johnson. 
Jesus, the guy says he is trying. But he isn't with it, not 
at all with it. When I talked to Ching about it, he said, Everyone 
can learn, if he is not a Reactionary or lazy. No one is stupid. That's 
what he said. He oughta know. It is plain as hell Johnson is 
no Reactionary. So you're not tryin, Johnson, you bastard you> 
**h He looked over at him, lying there, asleep, and he felt a wave of 
revulsion. How he loathed him. Sleepy-eyed, soft-spoken Johnson **h 
<Biggest thorn in my side of the whole fucken squad> **h He was 
the guy what always goofed at Question Time **h <Why couldn't they 
have dumped him off on someone else? Why me? Why didn't the 
damn Reactionaries bump him off? Why Slater?> **h Like a particle 
drawn to a magnet he returned to that which was pressing so hard 
in his mind. The music surged up, but it failed to check it. <Who 
is the man to take His place? The guy with most on the Ball>. Most 
on the Ball. <Handle men. Thoroughly Wised Up. Knows the score> 
**h With a supreme effort, he broke it off. He turned to the 
window again. A gnawing and gnashing within him. The snow was tumbling 
down furiously now. Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground, piling higher 
and higher. He stared at it, amazed, alarmed **h <The whole fucken 
sky's cavin in! Keeeerist! Lookit it! Cover the whole 
building, bury us all, by nightfall. Jesus! **h Somebody, got to be 
somebody **h If I don't put my two cents in soon, somebody else 
will **h I know they're waitin only for one thing: for the bastards 
what done it to be nailed. Maybe they already got them>. He was 
again tingling with pleasure, seeing himself clearly in Slater's shoes. 
<Top dog, sleeping and eating right there with the Staff. Ching, 
Tien, all of them **h Top dog **h Poor ol Slater **h Jesus, imagine, 
the crummy bastards, they'll get em, they'll get what's 
comin to em> **h He whirled about suddenly. It was nothing, though 
his heart was thumping wildly. Somebody was up. That was all. 
"Boy, you're stirrin early", a sleepy voice said.   "Yehhh", 
said Coughlin, testily, eyeing him up and down.   "Lookit 
that come down, willya", said the man, scratching himself, yawning.

"Yehhh", said Coughlin, practically spitting on him.

The man moved away.   <That's the way. They'll toe 
the line. Goddamn it. Keep the chatter to a minimum, short answers, 
one word, if possible. Less bull the more you can do with um. That's 
Brown's trouble. All he does is to bullshit with his squad, 
and they are the stupidest bastards around. Just about to get their asses 
kicked into hut Seven. Plenty of room there now. All those dumb 
8-Balls croaked. You can do anything with these dumb fucks if you 
know how. Anything. They'd cut their mothers' belly open. Give 
um the works. See,> he's <already snapping it up, the dumb jerk> 
**h Coughlin grinned, feeling supremely on top of things **h He watched 
the snow once again. It infuriated him. It made no sense to him 
**h He whirled around, suddenly hot all over, finding the man who had 
been standing before him a few moments back, nailing him to the spot 
on which he now stood, open-mouthed-   "You- Listen!- 
name William Foster's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism. 
Quick- Quick- NOW"!   The man shrank before 
the hot fury, searching frantically for the answer **h   Finnegan 
woke up. There was a hell of a noise this time of morning. He stared 
out the window. <For Christ's sake! The whole fucken sky's 
caved in!> He looked for the source of the noise that had awakened
