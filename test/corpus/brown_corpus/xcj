Iron Curtain. Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces 
with striking consistency.   Now listen closely: 
Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England: 
#@#

"President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals, 
to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat, as part of 
the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism. Evidently 
the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred 
up in the West have been planned long in advance. The West Berlin 
crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the 
United States to justify its arms drive".   The Soviet news 
agency ~TASS datelined from New York in English to Europe:

"President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military 
program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American 
munitions industry. When the stock exchange opened this morning, 
many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas, Lockheed and 
United Aircraft and prices rose substantially. Over 4 million shares 
were sold, the highest figures since early June. (Quotations follow".)

~TASS datelined Los Angeles, in English to Europe:

"Former Vice President Nixon came out in support of 
President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race. He also 
demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international 
tension: specifically to crush the Cuban revolution, resume 
nuclear testing, resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful 
seat in the United Nations, and postpone non-military programs at 
home".   ~TASS from Moscow in English to Europe:

"The American press clamored for many days promising President 
Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems 
confronting the United States. In fact, the world heard nothing 
but sabre-rattling, the same exercises which proved futile for the 
predecessors of the current President. If there were no West Berlin 
problem, imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping 
up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems 
besetting the United States and its ~NATO partners. Washington 
apparently decided to use an old formula, by injecting large 
military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U&S& economy 
after a prolonged slump". #@#

And now, for Communist 
listeners and readers:   Moscow Radio in Russian to the ~USSR:

"The U&S& President has shown once again that 
the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis 
to justify the armaments race. As was to be expected Kennedy's latest 
speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn, 
where officials of the West German government praised it".

Moscow Novosti article in Russian, datelined London:

"U&S& pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status 
of West Berlin has reached its apogee. British common sense is 
proverbial. The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate 
ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to 
pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures". 
#@#

East Berlin (Communist) radio in German to Germany:

"A better position for negotiations is the real point 
of this speech. Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West 
Berlin, neither conventional nor nuclear, and negotiations will come 
as certainly as the peace treaty. Whenever some Washington circles 
were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always 
succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn. 
In Kennedy's speech are cross currents, sensible ones and senseless 
ones, reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's 
advisers and the political and economic forces behind them. 
Well, dear listeners, despite all the shouting, there will be no war 
over West Berlin".   Moscow ~TASS in Russian datelined 
Sochi:   "Chairman Khrushchev received the U&S& President's 
disarmament adviser, John McCloy. Their conversation 
and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere".   Now, 
to translate from the Communese, this means:   The "West Berlin" 
crisis is really an East Berlin crisis. #@#

The crisis 
was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin (Wall Street) and the 
Red Army (Pentagon) egged on by the West Germans (East Germans).

The reason was to speed up domestic production in the ~USSR, 
which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power, and try to end 
the permanent recession in Russian living standards.   Chairman 
Khrushchev (Kennedy) rattles his rockets (sabre) in order to cure 
his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position. His advisers 
in the Politburo (White House) are engaged in a great struggle 
of opinions, so he is not always consistent.   The Soviet Union 
will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin, 
and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies. The West has no intention 
of attacking Russia.   Chairman Khrushchev and John McCloy 
had a terrible row at Sochi.   See, Communese is easy- once 
you get onto it.

Aug& 4, 1821, nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded 
the Pennsylvania Gazette- a century during which it had undergone 
several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication- 
this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening 
Post. The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C& Atkinson 
and Charles Alexander, who had just taken over Franklin's 
old paper, desired a more distinctive name.   When founded by Franklin 
the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name 
its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually 
contained more and more fiction, poetry, and literary essays. In the 
middle of the century, with a circulation of 90,000, the Post was one 
of the most popular weeklies in the country. But during the second half 
of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus 
H& K& Curtis purchased it- "paper, type, and all"- 
for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and 
initialed miscellany, and with only some 2,000 subscribers.   Little 
more than a fine old name, valuable principally because of the 
Franklin tradition, the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive. 
But Curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became 
one of the most popular weeklies of the country.

All this remembering took place the other night when I

A quarter of a century has gone by since this bevy of walking dreams 
sashayed up and down the staircases of the old New Amsterdam Theater, 
N&Y&. But watching Mrs& Cyril Ring, Berniece Dalton 
Janssen, Mrs& Robert Jarvis, Mrs& Walter Adams order low-calory 
seafood, no bread, I could see the Ziegfeld Girls of 1920 
were determined to be glamorous grandmothers of 1961.   I was 
anxious to hear about those dazzling days on the Great White Way. All 
I could remember was Billie Dove pasted over the ceiling of my 
big brother's room.   "Billie was really beautiful"! exclaimed 
Vera Forbes Adams, batting lovely big eyes behind glitter rimmed 
glasses.

SING SING'S prisoner strike was motivated by a reasonable 
purpose, a fair break from parole boards. But once the strike trend 
hits hoosegows, there is no telling how far it may go. Inmates might 
even demand the 34-hour week, all holidays off and fringe benefits including 
state contributions toward lawyers' fees. Some day we might 
see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates, with a leader busily 
trying to organize reformatory occupants, defendants out on bail, convicts 
opposed to probation officers, etc&. _@_ A three-day confinement 
week, with a month's vacation and shorter hours all around 
could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation, with 
fringe benefits including: _1._ Wider space between iron bars 
and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of 
metal. _2._ An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks 
used on prison doors. In case of a deadlock between prison boards 
and inmates, a federal arbitration board to include a "lifer" and 
two escapees should decide the issue. _3._ Specific broadening of 
travel rights. _4._ The right to leave the hoosegow any time to 
see a lawyer instead of waiting for a lawyer to make a trip to the prison. 

_5._ Recognition of Prisoners Union rule that no member of 
an iron or steel workers union be permitted to repair a sawed-off bar 
without approval and participation of representative of the cell occupant. 

_6._ No warden or guard to touch lock, key or doorknob except 
when accompanied by a prisoners' committee with powers of veto. 

_7._ State and federal approval of right to walk out at any time 
when so voted by 51 per cent of the prisoners. #@#

The death of 
Harold A& Stevens, oldest of the Stevens brothers, famed operators 
of baseball, football and race track concessions, revived again the 
story of one of the greatest business successes in history. Harold, 
with brothers Frank, Joe and William, took over at the death of their 
father, Harry M& Stevens, who put a few dollars into a baseball 
program, introduced the "hot dog" and paved the way for creation 
of a catering empire. Family loyalties and cooperative work have been 
unbroken for generations. #@#
