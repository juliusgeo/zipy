"Let's see", Cousin Ada said. "He's a right smart 
younger than the rest"?   "Oh yes", Mama laughed. "He's 
ten years younger than Ernest. We didn't expect him to come 
along; thought for the longest he was a tumor".   This joke 
was not funny to Linda Kay, and she blushed, as she always did; 
then, hearing the muffled boom of Howard's laughter, blushed redder.

"Who is Howard, anyway"? she asked Bobby Joe that 
night. "He makes me uncomfortable".   "Oh he's a second 
cousin or something. He got in the oil business out at Odessa and 
lucked into some money".   "How old is he"?   "Gosh, 
I don't know. Thirty-five, I guess. He's been married and 
got this half-grown kid. If he bothers you, don't pay him any mind. 
He's just a big windbag". Bobby Joe was thinking about something 
else. "Say, did you know they're fixing to have a two-day antelope 
season on the Double ~X"?   He was talking about antelope 
again when they woke up. "Listen, I never had a chance to 
kill an antelope. There never was a season before, but now they want 
to thin 'em out on account of the drouth".   "Did he ever 
visit here when he was a kid"? Linda Kay asked.   "Who"?

"Howard".   "Hell, I don't know. When he 
was a kid I wasn't around".   Bobby Joe took a gun from behind 
the door, and with a quick "Bye now" was gone for the day.

Almost immediately Howard and his daughter Debora drove up in 
the Cadillac.   "We're going after ice", Howard said, 
"and 
thought maybe you'd go along and keep us company".   There 
was really no reason to refuse, and Linda Kay had never ridden in 
a Cadillac.   Driving along the caliche-topped road to town, Howard 
talked. Finally he said, "Tell me about yourself", and Linda 
Kay told him, because she thought herself that she had had an interesting 
life. She was such a well-rounded teenager, having been a twirler, 
Future Farmers sweetheart, and secretary of Future Homemakers. 
In her sophomore year she had started going steady with Bobby Joe, 
who was a football player, Future Homemakers sweetheart, and president 
of Future Farmers. It was easy to see that they were made for 
each other, and they knew what they wanted. Bobby Joe would be a senior 
this year, and he planned to graduate. But there was no need for 
Linda Kay to go on, since all she wanted in life was to make a home 
for Bobby Joe and (blushing) raise his children.   Howard sighed. 
"You lucky kids", he said. "I'd give anything if I could 
have found a girl like you". Then he told Linda Kay about himself. 
Of course he couldn't say much, really, because of Debora, but 
Linda Kay could imagine what kind of woman his wife had been and 
what a raw deal he had got. It made her feel different about Howard.

She was going to tell Bobby Joe about how mistaken she had 
been, but he brought one of the cousins home for supper, and all they 
did was talk about antelope.   Bobby Joe was trying to get Linda 
Kay to say she would cook one if he brought it home.   "Cook 
a whole antelope"? she exclaimed. "Why, I couldn't even cook 
a piece of antelope steak; I never even saw any".   "Oh, 
you could. I want to roast the whole thing, and have it for the boys".

Linda Kay told him he couldn't do anything like that 
with his Grandma dying, and he said well they had to eat, didn't 
they, they weren't all dying. Linda Kay felt like going off to the 
bedroom to cry; but they were going up to the Big House after supper, 
and she had to put on a clean dress and fix her hair a little.

Every night they all went to Mama and Papa Albright's, and 
sat on the open front porch, where they could get the breeze. It was 
full-of-the-moon (or a little past), and nearly light as day. They all 
sat around and drank ice water, and the men smoked, and everybody had 
a good time. Once in a while they said what a shame it was, with Granny 
dying, but they all agreed she wouldn't have wanted it any other 
way.   That night the older men got to talking about going possum-hunting 
on a moonlight night. Bobby Joe and two or three of the 
other boys declared they had never been possum-hunting, and Uncle Bill 
Farnworth (from Mama Albright's side of the family) said he would 
just get 
up from there and take them, right then.   After they 
had left, some of the people moved around, to find more comfortable places 
to sit. There were not many chairs, so that some preferred to sit 
on the edge of the porch, resting their feet on the ground, and others 
liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall. Howard, 
who had been sitting against the wall, said he needed more fresh air, 
and took the spot on the edge of the porch where Bobby Joe had been 
sitting.   "You'll be a darn sight more comfortable there, Howard", 
Ernest said, laughing, and they all laughed.   Linda 
Kay felt that she was not exactly more comfortable. Bobby Joe had 
been sitting close to her, touching her actually, and holding her hand 
from time to time, but it seemed at once that Howard sat much closer. 
Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh, so that more of 
it seemed to come in contact with hers; but she had never been so aware 
of anyone's flesh before.   Still she was not sorry he sat 
by her, but in fact was flattered. He had become the center of the 
company, such stories he had to tell. He had sold oil stock to Bob Hope 
and Bing Crosby in person; he had helped fight an oil-well fire 
that raged six days and nights.

"But tell me, doctor, where do you plan to conduct the hatching"? 
Alex asked.   "That will have to be in the hotel", 
the doctor retorted, confirming Alex's anticipations. "What I 
want you to do is to go to the market with me early tomorrow morning 
and help smuggle the hen back into the hotel".   The doctor paid 
the bill and they repaired to the hotel, room number nine, to initiate 
Alex further into these undertakings.   The doctor opened 
the smallest of his cases, an unimposing straw bag, and exposed the contents 
for Alex's inspection. Inside, carefully packed in straw, 
were six eggs, but the eye of a poultry psychologist was required to detect 
what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside; to Alex 
they were merely six not unusual hens' eggs. There was little enough 
time to contemplate them, however; in an instant the doctor was stalking 
across the room with an antique ledger in his hands, thoroughly 
eared and big as a table top. He placed it on Alex's lap. 
"This is my hen ledger", he informed him in an absorbed way. "It's 
been going since 1908 when I was a junior in college. That first 
entry there is the Vermont Flumenophobe, the earliest and one of 
the most successful of my eighty-three varieties- great big scapulars 
and hardly any primaries at all. Couldn't take them near a river, 
though, or they'd squawk like a turkey cock the day before Thanksgiving".

The ledger was full of most precise information: 
date of laying, length of incubation period, number of chicks reaching 
the first week, second week, fifth week, weight of hen, size of rooster's 
wattles and so on, all scrawled out in a hand that looked more 
Chinese than English, the most jagged and sprawling Alex had ever seen. 
Below these particulars was a series of alpha-beta-gammas connected 
by arrows and crosses which denoted the lineage of the breed. Alex's 
instruction was rapid, for the doctor had to go off to the Rue 
Ecole de Medecine to hear more speeches with only time for one sip 
of wine to sustain him through them all. But after the doctor's return 
that night Alex could see, from the high window in his own room, 
the now familiar figure crouched on a truly impressive heap of towels, 
apparently giving its egg-hatching powers one final chance before it 
was replaced in its office by a sure-enough hen.   A knocking at 
Alex's door roused him at six o'clock the following morning. It 
was the doctor, dressed and ready for the expedition to the market, and 
Alex was obliged to prepare himself in haste. The doctor stood about, 
waiting for Alex to dress, with a show of impatience, and soon they 
were moving, as quietly as could be, through the still-dark hallways, 
past the bedroom of the <patronne>, and so into the street. The 
market was not far and, once there, the doctor's sense of immediacy 
left him and he fell into a state of harmony with the birds around him. 
He stroked the hens and they responded with delighted clucks, he gobbled 
with the turkeys and they at once were all attention, he quacked 
with the ducks, and cackled with a pair of exceedingly flattered geese. 
The dawn progressed and it seemed that the doctor would never be 
done with his ministrations when quite abruptly something broke his revery. 
It was a fine broody hen, white, with a maternal eye and a striking 
abundance of feathers in the under region of the abdomen. The doctor, 
with the air of a man whose professional interests have found scope, 
drew Alex's attention to those excellences which might otherwise 
have escaped him: the fine color in comb and wattles, the length and 
quality of neck and saddle hackles, the firm, wide spread of the 
toes, and a rare justness in the formation of the ear lappets. All search 
was ended; he had found his fowl. The purchase was effected and 
they made their way towards the hotel again, the hen, with whom some 
sort of communication had been set up, nestling in the doctor's arms.

The clocks struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel 
entrance; and hopes that the chambermaid and <patronne> would still 
be abed began to rise in Alex's well exercised breast. The doctor 
was wearing a long New England greatcoat, hardly necessary in the 
June weather but a garment which proved well adapted to the sequestration 
of hens. Alex entered first and was followed by the doctor who, 
for all his care, manifested a perceptible bulge on his left side where 
the hen was cradled. They advanced in a line across the entrance 
hall 
to the stairway and up, with gingerly steps, towards the first landing. 
It was then that they heard the tread of one descending and, in 
some perturbation glancing up, saw the <patronne> coming towards them 
as they gained the landing.   "Bonjour, messieurs, vous etes 
matinals", she greeted them pleasantly. Alex explained that they had 
been out for a stroll before breakfast while the doctor edged around 
behind him, attempting to hide the protuberance at his left side behind 
Alex's arm and back.   "Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners 
tout de suite alors"? their hostess enquired. Alex told her that 
there was no hurry for their breakfasts, trying at the same time to 
effect a speedy separation of the persons before and behind him. The 
doctor, he noticed, was attempting a transverse movement towards the stairs, 
but before the movement could be completed a distinct and audible 
cluck ruffled the air in the hollow of the stair-well. Eyes swerved 
in the <patronne's> head, Alex coughed loudly, and the doctor, 
with a sforzando of chicken noises floating behind him, took to the stairs 
in long-shanked leaps.   "Comment"? ejaculated the surprised 
woman, looking at Alex for an explanation but he, parting from 
her without ceremony, only offered a few words about the doctor's 
provincial American speech and a state of nerves brought on by the demands 
of his work. With that he hurried up the stairs, followed by her 
suspicious 
gaze.   When Alex entered his room, the doctor was already 
preparing a nest in the straw case, six eggs ready for the hen's 
attentions. There was no reference to the incident on the stairs, his 
powers being absorbed by this more immediate business. The hen appeared 
to have no doubts as to her duties and was quick to settle down 
to the performance of them. One part of her audience was totally engaged, 
the connoisseur witnessing a peculiarly fine performance of some 
ancient classic, the other part, the guest of the connoisseur, attentive 
as one who must take an intelligent interest in that which he does 
not fully understand. The spectacle progressed towards a denouement which 
was obviously still remote; the audience attended. Time elapsed 
but the doctor was obviously unconscious of its passage until an unwelcome 
knock on the door interrupted the processes of nature. Startled, 
he jumped up to pull hen and case out of view, and Alex went to the 
door. He opened it a crack and in doing so made as much shuffling, 
coughing, and scraping noise as possible in order to drown emanations
