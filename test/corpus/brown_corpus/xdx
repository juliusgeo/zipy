Christ as the second Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but 
whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality. This emphasis 
upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus 
shares with many early theologians, especially the Greek-speaking ones. 
They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility, 
which can mean (though it does not have to mean) deliverance from 
time and history.   Death reminds man of his sin, but it reminds 
him also of his transience. It represents a punishment that he knows 
he deserves, but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives 
his life within the process of time. These two aspects of death cannot 
be successfully separated, but they dare not be confused or identified. 
The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as 
altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of 
death cannot be separated. Such efforts almost always find themselves 
compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and 
then older and then still older, in short, whether Adam's life was 
intended to be part of the process of time. If it was, then it must 
have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from 
time to eternity. One night, so some of these theories run, Adam would 
have fallen asleep, much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve; 
and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal. The 
embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an 
illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment, for 
some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the 
natural order of time and change.   On the other hand, Christian 
faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal 
existence. It is the wages of sin, and its sting is the law. 
If 
this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea 
of death as natural termination, the conclusion seems inevitable that 
temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state 
into which man is put by the will of the Creator. This seems to have 
been the conclusion to which Origen was forced. If death receives 
more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives 
less than its share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ 
begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal, 
i&e&, created, existence. Such an interpretation of death radically 
alters the Christian view of creation; for it teaches salvation 
from, not salvation in, time and history. Because Christianity 
teaches not only salvation in history, but salvation by the history of 
Christ, such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision 
of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ.

Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist thinking, it manifestly 
is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right 
to refuse to accept persons it dislikes. The Unitarian clergy were 
an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen- as the term was then understood 
in the Back Bay- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman, 
either in theology or in manners. Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable 
representative of the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the 
issue in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated 
and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force 
could exist. Even so, Gannett judiciously argued, the Association could 
legitimately decide that Parker "should not be encouraged nor 
assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard 
to their correctness". We today are not entitled to excoriate 
honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who 
barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their 
congregations. 
One can even argue- though this is a delicate matter- 
that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture 
to the First Church, and so to suppress it, rather than let Parker 
use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should 
come to occupy it. Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen, 
as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father, 
they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title 
of Christians. Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for 
intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow "free inquiry" 
to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a "natural" religion.

Grant all this- still, when modern Unitarianism and 
the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults 
Parker lavished upon them, or else argue that after all Parker 
received the treatment he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience. 
Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation 
of Parker and the fraternity on January 23, 1843- while it 
may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker 
leave the Association, while it may plead that Dr& N& L& Frothingham 
had every warrant for stating, "The difference between Trinitarians 
and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity; the difference 
between Mr& Parker and the Association is a difference 
between no Christianity and Christianity"- despite these supposed 
conclusive assurances, the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh 
of relief, of positive thanksgiving, that the Association never quite 
brought itself officially to expel Parker. Had it done so, the blot 
on its escutcheon would have remained indelible, nor could the Harvard 
Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other 
than by getting down on its collective knees and crying "peccavi".

Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association did 
not actually command Parker to leave the room, though it came too close 
for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality. Fortunately, 
the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol 
defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and Chandler 
Robbins; whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and 
rushed out of the room, though not out of the Fellowship. In the 
hall, after adjournment, Dr& Frothingham took him warmly by the 
hand 
and requested Parker to visit him- whereupon our burly Theodore 
again burst into tears.   All this near tragedy, which to us borders 
on comedy, enables us to tell the story over and over again, always 
warming ourselves with a glow of complacency. It was indeed a near 
thing, but somehow the inherent decency of New England (which we inherit) 
did triumph. Parker was never excommunicated. To the extent 
that he was ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by saying 
he asked for it. Yet, even after all these stratagems, the conscience 
of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest, any more than is 
the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance 
for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School 
Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him. In both cases 
the stubborn fact remains: liberalism gave birth to two brilliant 
apostates, both legitimate offspring of its loins, and when brought 
to the test, it behaved shabbily. Suppose they both had ventured into 
realms which their colleagues thought infidel: is this the way gentlemen 
settle frank differences of opinion? Is it after all possible 
that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity 
they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any 
conservative has ever to worry about?   However, there is a crucial 
difference between the two histories. Emerson evaded the problem 
by shoving it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him: he walked 
out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick the wound of his 
departure, preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious 
veneration. Parker insisted upon <not> resigning, even when the majority 
wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to throw him 
out. Hence he was in his lifetime, as is the memory of him afterwards, 
a canker within the liberal sensitivity. He still points an accusing 
finger at all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to support 
him nor the energy to cut his throat.   Actually, the dispute 
between Parker and the society of his time, both ecclesiastical and 
social, was a real one, a bitter one. It cannot be smoothed over by 
now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or 
by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections 
to him. The fact is incontestable: that liberal world of Unitarian 
Boston <was> narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid 
of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm, 
and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle 
foundations were threatened. Parker, along with Garrison and 
Charles Sumner, showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs 
mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery. Nevertheless, 
we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace; 
their passions were genuine, and the division between them and the abolitionists 
is clear-cut. But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within 
the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository 
of liberality poses a different problem, which is not to be resolved by 
holding him up as the champion of freedom. Even though his theological 
theses have become, to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation 
he phrased is very much with us. It has been endlessly rephrased, 
but I may here put it thus: at what point do the tolerant find themselves 
obliged to become intolerant? And then, as they become aware 
that they have reached the end of their patience, what do they, to 
their dismay, learn for the first time about themselves?   There 
can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel 
in enforcing its canons of behavior. The gentle Channing, revered 
by all Bostonians, orthodox or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville 
that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant 
spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and 
action: "No city in the world is governed so little by a police, 
and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment. 
We stand more in awe of one another than most people. Opinion is 
less individual or runs more into masses, and often rules with a rod 
of iron". Even more poignantly, and with the insight of a genius, 
Channing added- remember, this is Channing, not Parker!- 
that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart, should 
he "speak without book, and consequently break some law of speech, 
or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should find little mercy".

Channing wrote this- in a letter! I think it fair to 
say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons. But Theodore 
Parker, commencing his mission to the world-at-large, disguised 
as the minister of a "twenty-eighth Congregational Church" which 
bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the 
founders (among which were still the Unitarian churches), made explicit 
from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish 
society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel 
difference about clerical decorum. Because he spoke openly with what 
Channing had prophesied someone might- with daring hyperbole- Parker 
vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed 
this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals 
were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines. 
An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an 
institution, and only within those defined limits a license. 
By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation, we should, 
I am sure, come to a fresh realization, however painful it be, that the 
battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest. He 
arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had 
to respond with, at the least, resentment. What otherwise could "the 
lawyer, doctor, minister, the men of science and letters" do when 
told that they had "become the cherubim and seraphim and the three 
archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant, and continually 
cried, 'Holy, holy, holy is the Almighty 
Dollar'"? 
Nor, when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan 
stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should we be 
astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of 
rage as Parker snarled at them thus: "Talk about the Catholics 
voting as the bishop tells! reproach the Catholics for it! You 
and I do the same thing. There are a great many bishops who have never 
had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre on their head, who appeal not 
to the authority of the Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar, 
a pope much nearer home. Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists,
