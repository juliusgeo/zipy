The medical title of "Lobar Ventilation 
in Man" by Drs& C& J& Martin and A& C& Young, covers 
a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics 
to the study of the respiratory process. At the University 
of Washington Medical School, the electronics group has developed 
the "Respiratory Gas Analyzer" shown in Fig& 3. This unit, 
affectionately dubbed "The Monster", can be wheeled to any convenient 
location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's 
breathing.   In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder 
indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper 
and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume of inhalation per breath, 
the flow of air from both lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes 
with respect to each other. Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece 
while walking a treadmill, standing still, or in some other medically 
significant position. From the resulting data the doctor can determine 
lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail. 

#HEART-MEASURING 
TECHNIQUES#

The original electrocardiograph primarily 
indicates irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques allow 
exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta, dimensioning 
of the heart and its chambers, and a much more detailed study of 
each heartbeat. For many of these measurements the chest must be opened, 
but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.

A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given 
a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques. One simple 
method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber 
tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change 
in resistance as the tube is stretched. A balanced resistance bridge 
and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.

Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing 
small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel 
and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy. The travel 
time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second thus it takes 
about 16 
|msec& to traverse 25 mm& of tissue. A sonar or radar-type 
of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for 
body-tissue evaluation. In addition to the heart and aorta, successful 
measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique. 
The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic signals, can be employed to 
measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.

A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining 
the effective power of the heart itself. It uses both an ultrasonic 
dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor 
inserted into the bloodstream. The latter measures the heat carried 
away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood 
flow. It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted 
at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left 
ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself. This pressure 
measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning 
measurement is made. A simplified version of the instrumentation 
for this procedure is shown in Fig& 2. Outputs of the two 
systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge, 
followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder. 
From this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter, pressure, 
and effective heart power. 

#RADIO-TRANSMITTER PILLS#

Several 
years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule 
which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal 
pressure data to external receivers. This original capsule contained 
a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm& in 
diameter. Battery life limited the use of this "pill" to about 8 
to 30 hours maximum.   A refinement of this technique has been described 
by Drs& Zworykin and Farrar and Mr& Berkely of the Medical 
Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute. In this 
novel arrangement the "pill" is much smaller and contains only a resonant 
circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing 
transducer. As shown in Fig& 4, an external antenna is placed over 
or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc& 
bursts. The energy received by the "pill" causes the resonant 
circuit to "ring" on after the burst and this "ringing" takes 
place at the resonant frequency of the "pill". These frequencies 
are amplified and detected by the ~FM receiver after each burst 
of transmitted energy and, after the "pill" has been calibrated, 
precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.   One of 
the advantages of this method is that the "pill" can remain in the 
patient for several days, permitting observation under natural conditions. 
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are 
planned for future experiments. 

#SONAR IN MEDICAL RESEARCH#

One 
of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine 
detection is in the exploration of the human body. Our readers 
are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent 
out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects. Various 
methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used 
to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water. 
In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the 
sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques 
may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.

Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission of 
ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels. 
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic 
signals. Based on this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used 
this method to "look through" human organs. A good example of 
the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers 
presented by Dr& G& Baum who has explored the human eye. He 
can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate 
blindness due to glaucoma. The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically 
is illustrated in Fig& 6. The transducer is coupled to the 
body through a water bath, not shown. For display, Dr& Baum uses 
a portion of an **f, an airborne radar indicator, and then photographs 
the screen to obtain a permanent record.   A typical "sonogram" 
of a human eye, together with a description of the anatomical 
parts, is shown in Fig& 5. The frequency used for these experiments 
is 15 mc& and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy 
lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter. 
The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan, just like 
a radar antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 
90-degree arc in front of the eye to "look into" all corners. 
The total 
picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector 
scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.   Drs& 
Howry 
and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied 
the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have 
obtained extremely good results. By submerging the patient in a tub 
and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on, they have been 
able to get cross-section views of the neck, as shown in Fig& 7, as 
well as many other hitherto impossible insights. As mentioned before, 
bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig& 7 the portion of the 
spine shows as the black area in the center. Arteries and veins are apparent 
by their black, blood-filled centers and the surrounding white 
walls.   A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in 
Fig& 8 with the various parts labeled.

OERSTED'S boyhood represented a minimal chance of either 
attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a 
span of life. He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on 
the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 
14, 1777. His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender 
income made it difficult to feed his family, let alone educate 
them in a town without even a school. The two older boys, Hans and Anders, 
his junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home of a 
warm 
and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German; his wife 
taught the two boys to read and write Danish. Other brothers later joined 
them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic 
was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal 
curriculum. Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the 
boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned, such as 
the pastor, to supplement the simple teaching. From the town surveyor, 
Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university student, 
some academic subjects. The mayor of the town taught them English 
and French. Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed 
on to each other; they read every book that they could borrow in the 
village. At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in 
the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his interest in medicine 
and science. His earlier love for literature and history remained with 
him for his entire life.   In 1793 the brothers decided to enter 
the University of Copenhagen (founded in 1479) and the following 
spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the 
autumn session. While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine, 
physics, and astronomy, his brother studied law. The brothers continued 
to help each other during their studies, sharing a joint purse, 
lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of 
their aunt. They supplemented their income by small government assistance, 
by tutoring and economizing wherever they could. So impressive 
were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later 
wrote, "to be perfectly free, the young man must revel in the great 
kingdom of thought and imagination; there is a struggle there, in which, 
if he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is freedom 
of utterance there, which draws after it no irreparable consequences on 
society **h. I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day 
overcame a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a previous 
error". He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing 
about science. In this third year at the university, Hans, in 1797, 
was awarded the first important token of recognition, a gold medal for 
his essay on "Limits of Poetry and Prose". He completed his training 
in pharmacy also, taking his degree with high honors in 1797, 
and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with 
a prize for an essay in medicine. He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis 
which later was accepted in chemical practices. 

#FERMENT OF SCIENTIFIC 
ACTIVITY#

HAN'S STUDENT DAYS were at a time when Europe 
was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America 
and in France, Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms 
and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the 
Continent.   The new century opened with Oersted beginning 
his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen 
and as lecturer at the university. He was stirred by the announcement 
of Volta's 
discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied 
the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis. The following 
year he devoted to the customary "Wanderjahr", traveling in 
Germany, France, and the Netherlands, meeting the philosophers Schelling,
