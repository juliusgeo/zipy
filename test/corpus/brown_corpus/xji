King any more than did the possibility that her daughter might 
marry a Bohemian, but she used it to suggest to Thompson that, 
"It 
is not in her nature to love you".   For his part, Thompson 
had explained in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an 
honorable friendship between Katie and himself. At no time does he 
seem to have proposed marriage, and Mrs& King was evidently torn between 
a concern for her daughter's emotions and the desire to believe 
that the friendship might be continued without harm to her reputation. 
In any case, she told Thompson that she saw no reason why he might 
not see Katie again, "now that this frank explanation has been made 
+ no one can misunderstand". She ended her letter with the assurance 
that she considered his friendship for her daughter and herself 
to be an honor, from which she could not part "without still more pain".

After Thompson came to London to live, he received a 
letter from Katie, which was dated February 8, 1897. She regretted 
what she described as the "unwarrantable + unnecessary" check to their 
friendship and said that she felt that they understood one another 
perfectly. This letter concluded with an invitation: "  I 
am a great deal at the little children's Hospital. Mr& Meynell 
knows the way. I know you are very busy now, you are writing a great 
deal + your book is coming out, isn't it? but if you are able + care 
to come, you know how glad I shall be.   Ever yours sincerely,

Katherine Douglas King" The invitation was accepted and 
other letters followed, in which she spoke of her concern for his health 
and her delight in seeing him so much at home among the crippled 
children she served. It is difficult to say what Thompson expected 
would come of their relationship, which had begun so soon after his emotions 
had been stirred by Maggie Brien, but when Katie wrote on April 
11, 1900, to tell him that she was to be married to the Rev& Godfrey 
Burr, the vicar of Rushall in Staffordshire, the news evidently 
helped to deepen his discouragement over the failure of his hopes 
for a new volume of verse. In a letter to Meynell, which was written 
in June, less than a month before Katie's wedding, he was highly 
melodramatic in his despair and once again announced his intention of 
returning to the life of the streets: "  A week in arrears, 
and without means to pay, I must go, it is the only right thing. **h 
Perhaps Mrs& Meynell would do me the undeserved kindness to keep 
my own copy of the first edition of my first book, with all its mementos 
of her and the dear ones. **h Last, not least, there are some poems 
which K& King sent me (addressed to herself) when I was preparing 
a fresh volume, asking me to include them. The terrible blow of 
the New Year put an end to that project. I wish you would return them 
to her. I have not the heart. **h I never had the courage to look 
at them, when my projected volume became hopeless, fearing they were 
poor, until now when I was obliged to do so. **h O my genius, young 
and <ripening,> you would swear,- when I wrote them; and now! 
What has it all come to? All chance of fulfilling my destiny is 
over. **h I want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poems, dear 
father-brother, now I am gone; and launch them on the world when their 
time comes. For them a box will be lodgment enough. **h Katie cannot 
mind your seeing them now; since my silence must have ended when 
I gave the purposed volume to you. **h I ask you to do me the last 
favour of reading them by 8 to-morrow evening, about which time I shall 
come to say my sad good-bye. If you don't think much of them, tell 
me the wholesome truth. If otherwise, you will give me a pleasure. 
O Wilfrid! it is strange; but this- yes, <terrible> step I 
am about to take **h is lightened with an inundating joy by the new-found 
hope that here, in these poems, is treasure- or at least some 
measure of beauty, which I did not know of". **h Thompson, of 
course, 
was persuaded not to take the <"terrible> step"; Meynell once 
again paid his debts and it was Katie, rather than Thompson, whose 
life was soon ended, for she died in childbirth in April, 1901, in 
the first year of her marriage.   The "orphaned poems" mentioned 
in the letter to Meynell comprised a group of five sonnets, which 
were published in the 1913 edition of Thompson's works under the 
heading "Ad Amicam", plus certain other completed pieces and rough 
drafts gathered together in one of the familiar exercise books. The 
publication of Father Connolly's <The Man Has Wings> has made 
more of the group available in print so that a general picture of 
what it contained can now be had without difficulty. Some of the poems 
express a mood of joy in a newly discovered love; others suggest its 
coming loss or describe the poet's feelings when he learns of a final 
separation.   The somewhat Petrarchan love story which these 
poems suggest cannot obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more 
than a little of autobiographical sincerity. When they were first 
written, there was evidently no thought of their being published, and 
those which refer to the writer's love for Mrs& Meynell particularly 
have the ring of truth. In "My Song's Young Virgin Date", 
for example, Thompson wrote: "Yea, she that had my song's 
young virgin date Not now, alas, that noble singular she, I nobler 
hold, though marred from her once state, Than others in their best integrity. 
My own stern hand has rent the ancient bond, And thereof shall 
the ending not have end: But not for me, that loved her, to be 
fond Lightly to please me with a newer friend. Then hold it more than 
bravest-feathered song, That I affirm to thee, with heart of pride, 
I knew not what did to a friend belong Till I stood up, true friend, 
by thy true side; Whose absence dearer comfort is, by far, Than 
presences of other women are"!   Taking into account Thompson's 
capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish 
to identify his own life with the misfortunes of other poets who had known 
unhappy loves, there can be no doubt about his genuine emotion for 
Katie King. That she was affected by his protestations seems obvious, 
but since she was evidently a sensible young woman- as well as 
an outgoing and sympathetic type- it would seem that for her the word 
<friendship> had a far less intense emotional significance than that 
which Thompson gave it. From the outset, she must have realized that 
marriage with him was out of the question, and although she was displeased 
by the "unwarrantable" interference, it seems probable that 
she did agree with her mother's suggestion that the poet was "perhaps" 
a man "most fitted to live + die solitary, + in the love 
only of the Highest Lover".   The poems which were addressed 
to her, while they are far more restrained than those of "Love in 
Dian's Lap", show no great technical advance over those of the "Narrow 
Vessel" group and are, if anything, somewhat more labored. 
Their interest remains chiefly biographical, for they throw some light 
on the utter despair which overtook Thompson in the spring and early 
summer of 1900.   Whether or not Danchin is correct in suggesting 
that Thompson's resumption of the opium habit also dates from 
this period is, of course, a matter of conjecture. Reid simply states, 
without offering any supporting evidence, that "after he returned 
to London, he resumed his draughts of laudanum, and continued this 
right up to his death". There is every reason to recognize that in 
the very last years of his life, as we shall see, Thompson did take 
the drug in carefully rationed doses to ease the pains of his illness, 
but the exact date at which this began has never been determined. If, 
as Reid says, "nearly all his poetry was produced when he was not 
taking opium", there may be some reason to doubt that he was under 
its influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he was writing the 
poems to Katie King and making plans for another book of verse. In 
any event, the critical productivity of that time is abundant proof that 
if he was taking laudanum, it was never in command of him to the extent 
that it had been during his vagrant years.   Meynell's remedy 
for Thompson's despondent mood was typically practical. He simply 
found more work for him to do, and the articles and reviews continued 
without an evident break. #@ /3, @#

As a reviewer, Thompson 
generally displayed a judicious attitude. That he read some 
of the books assigned to him with a studied carefulness is evident from 
his notes, which are often so full that they provide an unquestionable 
basis for the identification of reviews that were printed without 
his signature. On the basis of this careful reading, Thompson frequently 
gave a clear, complete, and interesting description of a prose work 
or chose effective quotations to illustrate his discussions of poetry.

He was seldom an unmethodical critic, and his reviews generally 
followed a systematic pattern: a description of what the work 
contained, a treatment of the things that had especially interested him 
in it, and, wherever possible, a balancing of whatever artistic merits 
and faults he might have found.   It was, of course, in this 
drawing 
of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly displayed his desire 
to do full justice to an author. Reviewing Davidson's <The 
Testament of an Empire Builder,> for example, Thompson found 
that 
there was "too much metrical dialectic". Poetry, he said, must be 
"dogmatic": it must not stoop to argue like a "K&C& in 
cloth-of-gold". Yet Davidson impressed him as a poet capable of "sustained 
power, passion, or beauty", and he cited specific passages 
to illustrate not only these qualities but Davidson's command of 
imagery as well. Similarly, he wrote that Laurence Housman had a "too 
deliberate manner" as well as a lack of "inevitable felicity 
in diction". But he admired Housman's "subtle intellectuality" 
and delighted in the inversion by which Divine Love becomes the most 
"fatal" allurement in "Love the Tempter".   Of course, 
there were books about which nothing good could be said. Understanding, 
as he did, the difficulty of the art of poetry, and believing 
that the "only technical criticism worth having in poetry is that of 
poets", he felt obliged to insist upon his duty to be hard to please 
when it came to the review of a book of verse.

As he had done on his first Imperial sortie a year and a half 
before, Lewis trekked southeast through Red Russia to Kamieniec. 
Thence he pushed farther south than he had ever been before into Podolia 
and Nogay Tartary or the Yedisan. There, along the east bank 
of the Southern Bug, opposite the hamlet of Zhitzhakli a few miles 
north of the Black Sea, he arrived at General Headquarters of the 
Russian Army. By June 19, 1788, he had presented himself to its Commander 
in Chief, the Governor of the Southern Provinces, the Director 
of the War College- The Prince. ##

Catherine's first 
war against the Grand Turk had ended in 1774 with a peace treaty 
quite favorable to her. By 1783 her legions had managed to annex the 
Crimea amid scenes of wanton cruelty and now, in this second combat with 
the Crescent, were aiming at suzerainty over all of the Black Sea's 
northern shoreline.   Through most of 1787 operations on 
both sides had been lackadaisical; those of 1788 were going to prove 
decisive, though many of their details are obscure. To consolidate what 
her Navy had won, the Czarina was fortunate that, for the first 
time in Russian history, her land forces enjoyed absolute unity of command 
under her favorite Giaour. Potemkin was directing this conflict 
on three fronts: in the Caucasus; along the Danube and among the 
Carpathians, in alliance with the Emperor Joseph's armies; and 
in the misty marshlands and shallow coastal waters of Nogay Tartary 
and Taurida, including the Crimean peninsula. Here the war would 
flame to its focus, and here Lewis Littlepage had come.   Potemkin's 
Army of Ekaterinoslav, totaling, it was claimed, 40,000 regular 
troops and 6,000 irregulars of the Cossack Corps, had invested 
Islam's principal stronghold on the north shore of the Black Sea, 
the fortress town of Oczakov, and was preparing to test the Turk by 
land and sea. During a sojourn of slightly more than three months Chamberlain 
Littlepage sould see action on both elements.   As his 
second in command The Prince had Marshal Repnin, one-time Ambassador 
to Poland. Repnin, who had a rather narrow face, longish nose, 
high forehead, and arching brows, looked like a quizzical Mephistopheles.
