children. We already have courses covering those problems, and so on. 
But within that framework he allowed for as much flexibility as possible. 
A steering committee of students was organized on the first day 
whose duty it was to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate 
the direction and <pace> the class was taking. The writer, being 
cognizant through his interviews of the reactions of previous married 
students, did insist on there being included some "hind sight" material. 
But the greater part of semester time was actually centered around 
the attitudes "So we are married- now how do we make the best 
of it"? or "How do we <enrich> our already fine marriage"?

Films were used, as with all sections, but with one big difference. 
Our campus, unfortunately, owns no films. Since they are all 
either rented or borrowed, the requested dates for their use have to 
be far in advance. The writer never knew from week to week just where 
the section might be. For example, the steering committee might announce 
that the group felt a topic under study should not be dropped for 
an additional week as there was still too much of it untouched. Since 
the writer had established this democratic procedure in the beginning 
he had to go along with their decision- after, of course, pointing 
out 
whether he thought their decision was a wise or an unwise one. Thus the 
films seen as they came in (coordinated for the regular sections), 
were often out of context. Nevertheless, the writer has never experienced 
such spontaneity of discussion after film showings.   Though 
it did not become known to the writer for some time, a nucleus group 
had sprung up within the class. They began to meet in the evenings and 
carry forward various discussions they felt not fully enough covered 
in class. From a few students this group gradually increased to include 
over three-fourths of those officially enrolled in the class, and 
many outsiders as well. Also, although only a few of the students were 
intimately acquainted with each other in the beginning, most reported 
that when the semester ended their dearest and closest campus friendships 
were with members of that class. In fact, they often revamped 
their social activities to include class members previously unknown.

Supplemental outside reading reports were handled just as in the 
other sections, the major difference being that there was a noticeably 
<deeper level> in the reported outside reading by the married group. 
These students, although they might read various articles in popular 
magazines, more often chose to report on articles found in the journals. 
In addition to the noticeable difference in outside articles, 
there was a considerable difference in the outside books they read. Whereas 
a high per cent of the regular students can be expected to read 
other texts which more or less plow the same ground in a little different 
direction, the married students chose whole books on specific areas 
and went into much greater detail in their areas of interest. Since 
the writer had not noticed this characteristic in married students scattered 
throughout the various sections previous to this experiment, 
nor, as a matter of fact, in those who were continuing in "single sections", 
he can only conclude that there must have been something "contagious" 
within the specific group which caused this to occur.

In the main, this course took the following directional high roads: 
1) A great deal of time was spent on <processes> for solving 
marital differences. This was not a search for a "magic formula", 
but rather an examination of basic principles pertaining especially 
to all types of communication in marriage. In short, it was centered 
around learning how to develop a <more sensitive empathy>. Not until 
the group was satisfied in this area were they willing to venture further 
to 2) Specific adjustment areas, such as sex, in-laws, religion, 
finance, and so on. From here they proceeded to 3) These same areas 
in relation to their own future family life stages, developing these 
to the extent of examining various crises which could be expected to 
confront them at some time or other.   As an example of this last 
facet, there were some lengthy discussions centered around bereavement. 
Mainly these were concerned with the possibility of the death of 
one parent and the complication of living with the survivor afterward, 
but the possible death of one's own spouse was not overlooked. Since 
the course, one member has lost her husband. This was not a particularly 
shocking or unexpected thing- it was previously known to her 
that it might happen. But just when was an unknown, and of course the 
longer it did not happen, the stronger her wish and belief that it might 
not. Since her bereavement this individual has reported to the writer 
on numerous occasions about how helpful the class discussions were 
to her in this adjustment crisis.   Quite frequently class members 
brought questions from their mates at home. These were often carefully 
written out with a great deal of thought behind them. This added 
a personal zest to class discussions and participation.   Both 
sexes reported that the discussions on sex adjustment within marriage 
were extremely enlightening. The writer sensed a much freer and more 
frank discussion, especially of this one area, than ever before. He 
felt certain for the first time in his teaching experience that the men 
in the class understood that orgasm, as a criterion, is not nearly so 
essential for a satisfying female sexual experience as most males might 
think. This was probably much more meaningful because all the women 
in the class emphasized it time and again. On the other hand, the 
women class members appeared to reach a far greater understanding than 
have women members in other sections that it is more natural for males 
as a group to view sex as sex rather than always associating it with 
love as most women seem to do.   in the reproductive area it could 
be readily observed that all felt freer to discuss things than students 
had previously in "mixed" marital status sections. Perhaps this 
was related to the fact that all were in on it to some extent. Never 
in other sections has there been the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth 
discussions about the feelings of both spouses during various 
stages of pregnancy. There was a particularly marvelous opportunity 
for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy was represented, 
from a childless couple to and including every trimester. 
In fact, we had one birth before the end of the course, and another student 
had to take the final examiantion a week early, just to be on the 
safe side. There was also one spontaneous abortion during the semester. 
Thus it is reasonable to believe that there is a significant difference 
between the two groups in their performance on this task after a brief 
"structuring" experience.   It was predicted that Kohnstamm-negative 
subjects would adhere to more liberal, concretistic reports 
of what the ambiguous figure "looked like" as reflecting their 
hesitancy about taking chances. This was true mostly of those Kohnstamm-negative 
subjects who did not perceive the ambiguous figure as people 
in action. Responses such as "rope with a loop in it", and "two 
pieces of rope", were quite characteristic. _GUILFORD-MARTIN 
PERSONALITY INVENTORIES._ The three personality inventories (Guilford 
~STDCR; Guilford-Martin ~GAMIN; Guilford-Martin 
~OAGCo), were filled out by 12 of the Kohnstamm-positive 
subjects and 19 of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects. These were the 
same subjects who were given the Rorschach test. Some predictions 
had been made concerning factors ~R, ~N, ~I and ~Co on these 
inventories which appeared to be directly related to control and security 
aspects of personality functioning which were hypothesized as 
being of importance in differential Kohnstamm reactivity.   Only 
~Co differentiated between the two groups at less that the 5% level 
(**f).   One prediction had been made about the difference 
in 
security or self-confidence between those subjects who shifted their Kohnstamm 
reactivity when informed and those who did not. The nonreactors 
had been separated into two groups on this assumption with the presumably 
"secure" nonreactors and "secure" reactors being used 
as the groups for comparative personality studies. It was predicted 
that those who shifted in their Kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly 
from those who did not on the factor ~I which the investigators 
refer to as the "Inferiority" factor. All of the subjects 
in the Kohnstamm-negative and Kohnstamm-positive groups (as defined 
for purposes of the personality studies) were compared with those subjects 
who shifted in Conditions /3, or /4,. A ~t test on these 
two groups, shifters vs& nonshifters, gave a "~t" value of 2.405 
which 
is significant on the two-tail test at the .028 level. 

#DISCUSSION# 

_INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES_ Individual differences in Kohnstamm 
reactivity to controlled Kohnstamm situations were found among the 
subjects used in the study. Only 27% (11 subjects) gave a positive 
Kohnstamm reaction when completely nai^ve concerning the phenomenon. 
There were 49% (20 subjects) who did not give a positive reaction 
even after they were informed of the normalcy of such a reaction and 
had been given a demonstration. There were 24% (10 subjects) who 
shifted from a negative to a positive reaction after they were reassured 
as to the normalcy of the Kohnstamm-positive reaction.   Among 
this latter group there were also differences in the amount and kind 
of information necessary before a shift in reaction occurred. One subject 
changed when given only the information that some people have something 
happen to their arm when they relax. Five subjects (12%) did 
not change until they had been told that some people have something 
happen to their arm, what that something was, and also were given a 
demonstration. 
Four subjects (10%) did not change even then but needed 
the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstances 
was a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people showed 
while others did not. At no time was it implied by the experimenter 
that the subject's initial reaction was deviant. The subjects were 
only given information about <other possibilities of "normal" reaction>. 
Those who responded with an arm-elevation in the nai^ve state 
did not change their reaction when told that there were some normal 
people who did not react in this fashion. This information was accepted 
with the frequent interpretation that those persons who did not 
show arm-levitation must be preventing it. These subjects implied that 
they too could prevent their arms from rising if they tried. 
The positive Kohnstamm reactivity in Condition /1, (the nai^ve 
state) is not adequately explained by such a concept as suggestibility 
(if suggestibility is defined as the influence on behavior by verbal 
cues). In no way, either verbally or behaviorally, did the experimenter 
indicate to the subjects any preferred mode of responding to the voluntary 
contraction. Moreover, when the experimenter did inform those 
subjects that there were some normal people who did not have their arm 
rise once they relaxed, the Kohnstamm-positive subjects were uninfluenced 
in their subsequent reactions to the Kohnstamm situation. They 
continued to give an arm-elevation. A differential suggestibility would 
have to be invoked to explain the failure of this additional information 
to influence the Kohnstamm-positive reactors and yet attribute 
their nai^ve Kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion. Autosuggestibility, 
the reaction of the subject in such a way as to conform to his own 
expectations of the outcome (i&e&, that the arm-rise is a reaction 
to the pressure exerted in the voluntary contraction, because of his 
knowledge that "to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction") 
also seems inadequate as an explanation for the following 
reasons: (1) the subjects' apparently genuine experience of surprise 
when their arms rose, and (2) manifestations of the phenomenon despite 
anticipations of something else happening (e&g&, of becoming dizzy 
and maybe falling, an expectation spontaneously volunteered by one 
of the subjects).   A suggestion hypothesis also seems inadequate 
as an explanation for those who shifted their reactions after they 
were informed of the possibilities of "normal" reactions different 
from those which they gave. While they were told that there were some 
normal people who reacted differently than they had, they were also informed 
that there were other normals who reacted as they had. There 
was no implication made that their initial reaction (absence of an arm-elevation) 
was less preferred than the presence of levitation. A more 
tenable explanation for the change in reactions is that the added knowledge 
and increased familiarity with the total situation made it possible
