said Mr& Partlow, "that's fine, Tom. Just 
fine".   As he drove home through the thinning traffic, Cady 
felt the unease growing. He hadn't told anyone, but he, too, had applied 
to five colleges for David. They had all turned down his son. 
Weakness in leadership. So sorry. Limited interests. So sorry. No 
clear motivation. So sorry.   He suddenly realized when he walked 
into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini 
Anne had waiting for him. But tonight his drink tasted like branch 
water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no 
surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket. 
Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did. He liked 
looking at Anne. Most people did. He liked her blond hair and the 
sprinkle of freckles across her nose. From those navy-blue eyes she 
saw things as clearly and honestly as David did. She always could sense 
the shag end of a woolly day.

"Board meeting tonight, Cady"?

"No, I begged off. Work to do".   "Can 
I have the car, dad"?   "Why not let him take it, Cady? 
I know it is midweek, but it's only eight days before commencement. 
Let's forget the rules".   Cady, deep in thought, neither 
heard nor answered. ##

David grinned. Carefully he put down his 
steak knife and said loudly, "Mr& Chairman"!   Cady 
Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse. "I'm 
sorry, Dave. The car? Of course you can have it". 
Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else, slowly, methodically 
and with interest. "Hear anything from Hanford yet, dad"?

Cady begged the question. "Don't worry about it, Dave. 
Your acceptance will come through".   Dave shrugged on his 
sports coat and picked up the car keys. "Don't be too sure, dad. 
Charles Burke got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-~A 
student".   Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles 
was antisocial, a lone wolf, and completely one-sided. "I can hardly 
say the same about you, Dave"!   Dave kissed her lightly. 
"Girls, my dear parent, are here to stay! Get my old man to 
bed early. He looks a little bit frayed".   Anne waited until 
the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot. "Let's go into 
the library. You do seem somewhat tattered".   Cady trailed 
her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable 
book-lined room. "I didn't know I looked so dilapidated"!

"Wrong word, darling. Your fur has been rubbed the 
wrong way and you show it. Need any help"?   "In a way, yes. 
Hanford College hasn't decided on Dave's application yet. They 
want a letter from me on his motives, interests and leadership. Here's 
what I wrote".   Cady handed her the letter, drank his 
coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence. 
Already he could feel Anne's questioning eyes.   "I know you 
wrote this in a hurry, 
but, Cady, Dave was only <acting> president 
of the student forum for a few days. That was when half the school 
was down with flu".   "But he <was> president". 
"And he wasn't really <elected> treasurer of the science club. 
He just took over the week Bill Daley was in the state basketball play-off".

Cady stuck his jaw out. "The fact remains he <was> 
treasurer".   "And the swimming team. No, Cady, he 
made second team. Just missed the 
first".   "A team is a team", insisted Cady. "Anything 
else"?   "Yes", she said quietly. "I don't think 
you've been quite honest, Cady. It isn't like you. David's interests. 
Astronomy. He was mad about stars at the age of nine. Geology, 
You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond 
six years ago! Those aren't his interests now".   "What 
do you suggest"?   "Just say he likes swimming, tennis, 
chess and music".   "Music! He hasn't been to a symphony 
concert all season".   Anne smiled. "But he plays bass 
with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts"!   "You 
mean that rock-and-roll combo? Even in that he never solos like Jack 
on guitar or Rich on sax. He's- he's just there, that's 
all".   "Yes, he's just there. He keeps the beat going. He 
likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo. He doesn't 
like to rise and shine. Don't worry, Cady, he'll be back in the 
Beethoven fold by next year".   Cady appeared slightly mollified. 
"All right. But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention 
Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts".   Anne laughed and 
Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck. "Maybe 
I am padding it a bit, Anne", he said. "But you know how hard 
it is to get a boy into a good college. He has to have leadership 
as well as grades".   Anne folded the worrisome document. "Did 
you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this 
weekend? He hasn't used it now for several years. Can you really 
say his motivation for college is electronics"?   Cady felt 
the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel. "And what 
would you say he wants to do? Just what"?   "It's 
Dave who is applying to Hanford College. Why don't you ask him"?

For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so 
he could yell back. "I have talked to him, but you know I've never 
tried to push him into any profession. I won't be guilty of trying 
to run his life".   Anne picked up the towel she was hemming 
for the hospital guild. "Just because your father tried to make 
a banker out of you, you've leaned over backward to keep your hands 
off. But subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold. 
You want him to be a leader of men, like you".   Cady put the 
well-worn chip back on his shoulder. "Dave <has> qualities of leadership. 
He just hasn't developed them yet. Give him time".

He never will, Cady. Not the kind of leadership you mean, working 
with lots of people. All your wishful thinking won't change 
that. 
Remember what you used to say in the Army? You can't run a war 
with ninety-nine generals and one private"!   Cady walked 
the block to the mailbox, almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne.

Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist 
at all. And once begun, had grown to such monstrous proportions. 
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life.   Lying awake 
at night, he could see them, laid out on the floor of his mind. When 
he rose in the morning, the image was still there.   He had always 
been a messy and negligent man. In his bachelor days, his bedroom 
had been strewn with clothes which his mother, or later the hotel maid, 
generally saw fit to put in order. No doubt Dolores resented following 
in their footsteps.   But it was fun those first days, kidding 
about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug. There 
was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up. Half 
slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things.   He 
remembered the first time he saw her, standing across the room at a party. 
The smooth curve of her neck, very white against hair which curled 
against it like petals. Her hair was the color of those blooms which 
in seed catalogues are referred to as "black", but since no flower 
is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple 
or blue- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers, 
searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its 
true shade beneath the darkness.   So he sought her out, and spoke 
to her, and thought of his hand in her hair. Or against her back, 
pressed on the column of vertebrae, which held her so magnificently 
straight and unyielding, until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking 
noises, like the snapped stem of a tulip.   But, to put it 
bluntly, nothing snapped. Yet that had not seriously troubled him, 
not then. They married. More he could take at leisure. All Martin 
thought he needed was time: to what better use could time be put?

He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly. There 
was too little occasion beforehand for resistance, the brave strong 
delights of emotional clash and meeting. They had left themselves 
too much to discover.   But, at the start, his new life felt invigorating. 
Good.   It was on the tenth day after the wedding (how 
could it have been so soon?) that he dropped the shorts on the floor.

"Now, I'm not going to pick up those shorts"!

Martin gave her a teasing pat. "I think you'll get tired of 
them there".   In the morning the shorts were where he had left 
them. He smiled to himself, and decided not to mention them till 
Dolores did. It was almost too easy. For he had just remembered: 
tonight they were having their first guests. The shorts would not be 
on the floor when he came home that evening.   He was wrong. The 
rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness, but in 
the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts. They gave the room 
a strange note of incongruity, like a mole on a beautiful face.

He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute, thinking 
he would get nervous. Quietly he determined to foil her. I can 
be as stubborn as she can, he thought; my nerves are as strong. She'll 
rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings.   It rang. Ten 
minutes early.   Martin was standing a few feet from the front 
door. He swung around, eyes toward the bedroom, some fifteen feet 
away. Dolores stood motionless in the doorway.   He could not cross 
the living room, brush past her, and bend down to retrieve the shorts.

Martin turned his back. He strode to answer the bell.

Bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet. With the most casual 
and relaxed manner in the world, Dolores led Anthea to the bedroom. 
Martin strained his ears.   At first he could not be sure. 
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there. 
A glissade of giggles slid over their voices.   All evening Anthea 
favored him with odd, coy looks. Clearly she had been instructed 
"not to say a word". For some reason, this ellipsis in the conversation 
spread until it swallowed up every other topic. At last there 
was a void no one could fill. The Brainards went home early.

Martin realized, later on, that he should have "had it out" with 
Dolores that night. As violently as possible. But he was so taken 
aback, he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in. 
On the contrary, it would only weaken his position if he fumed, while 
she stayed calm and adamant. And if he surrendered <after> raving 
at her. **h He shivered.   Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether? 
At once. He considered the sober possibility.   In 
his head was the echo of those titters with Anthea.   There was 
something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel 
scabrous and unclean. He remembered his mother gossiping with her 
neighborhood women friends, 
lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness 
which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs, where he 
crouched listening. He could even recall the last time he sat there. 
She was talking about him that time, because he had done some bad thing, 
something she disliked, but "Afterwards Martin said he was sorry. 
He apologized so sweetly, I couldn't keep being annoyed with 
him". It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time; 
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened, 
which was as honest as he could put it. But his mother told the 
story over and over, till her "Martin said he was sorry" was as 
much a part of her as the shape of her thin, pallid ears.   The 
battle had to be fought. Let the best sex win.   But his resolution
