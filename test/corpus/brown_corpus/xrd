Handing the money over, Russ wiped his hands on his pants-legs 
as if ridding himself of something unclean. His glance at Gyp 
Carmer was disdainful. "Shall we get out of here"?   Leaving 
the card room, they moved back through the Palace the way they 
had come. Glowering looks met them in the bar, but there was no attempt 
to halt them. Pausing in the outside door to glance behind him, Pat 
looked his unspoken warning and stepped out. He and Cobb clattered 
down the high steps to the street.   Neither spoke till they reached 
their horses. Pat paused there, looking across at the young fellow. 
It'll be a pleasure for you to return this money to Colcord 
and tell him about it, Russ". He started to return it.   To 
his faint surprise Russ held up his hand. "Not me", he ruled decidedly. 
I've had enough. It was you that tracked it down anyway, Stevens", 
he pursued strictly. "I'll shove along home".

"Whatever you say". Pat swung into the saddle, yet still he delayed, 
his brows puckered. "You owe it to Penny to give her a chance 
to explain that she was defending you, really", he observed mildly.

"Old Crip wasn't", retorted Cobb tartly. "He'll 
know when you tell him. But I want this to sink in awhile. Then maybe 
next time he won't be so quick on the trigger".   "Pat 
had never pretended to give advice in such affairs. "You're the 
doctor", he returned with a smile. "But I still think Penny's 
an awful nice girl, Russ"-   "You don't have to tell 
me", flashed Cobb. Giving the other a dark look, he hauled his bronc 
around and trotted down off the street. Pat let him go, following 
more leisurely. At the first restaurant he sensibly pulled up to go in 
for his dinner, and as a consequence did not see Cobb strike the open 
range at the mouth of the canyon and head straight across the swells 
for Antler.   The truth was, the puncher was both bewildered 
and dismayed by his own mixed luck. "Penny's always glad to see me 
over there", he mused bleakly. Yet had he not visited the girl at 
Saw Buck he would never have been involved in this latest tangle.

Over and above that, however, was his growing suspicion of Chuck 
Stober's part in recent events. "Gyp Carmer couldn't have 
known about Colcord's money unless he was told- and who else would 
have told him"? he asked himself. "It's the second time War 
Ax hands made a play for that money.   How much of an accident 
could that be"?   Nearing home, he jerked to attention at 
the distant crack of a gun. In town no one paid much attention to an 
occasional shot; but on the range gunfire had a meaning. Hauling up, 
Russ listened carefully. Two minutes later it came again- a double 
explosion, followed by a third, sounding more distant.   As near 
as Cobb could determine the shots came from the direction of the 
Antler ranch house. He tightened up in a twinkling. So far as he knew, 
only his father could be there. What did it mean? Clapping spurs 
to the bronc he set off at a sharp canter, with growing alarm.

His first glimpse of the ranch house across the brushy swells 
told 
him nothing. Still a quarter-mile away, the fresh clap of guns only served 
to increase his speed. Setting a course straight for the house, 
he was covering ground fast when an angry bee buzzed past close to his 
face.   When it was followed by a second, whining even closer, 
Cobb 
swerved sharply aside into a depression. He knew now what he was 
up against. Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover was besieging 
the Antler house and, having spotted his approach, was determined 
to drive him off before he could get into the fight.   Cursing 
himself for having ridden out the last few days without a rifle in 
his saddle boot, Russ drew his Colt and examined it briefly. If he 
wondered whether the attackers would allow him to pull away unmolested, 
he had his answer a moment later.   "Over this way! He ain't 
gone far"! a harsh cry floated to him across the brush.

A carbine cracked more loudly, and a slug clipped fragments from the 
brush off at one side. The would-be assassin had his position figured 
pretty close. Dismounting, Russ looked about hastily. Toward the 
west this depression led toward a draw. Leading his pony, he hurried 
that way, not remounting till he was well below the level of the surrounding 
range.   Swinging up then, and bending forward over the 
horn, he urged his mount down the meandering draw. He had not covered 
a hundred yards before a gun crashed from somewhere behind. He had 
been sighted, and his attacker pumping shot after shot. A shot or two 
went wild before Cobb felt something tug at his foot. A slug had torn 
half of his stirrup-guard away. A second twitched his shirtsleeve, 
and he felt a brief burn on his upper arm. Another snarled close overhead.

"Jumping Jerusalem! Let's get out of here"!

At the first shot Russ had hurled his mount to the left toward 
the side of the winding draw. The long minute before he reached effective 
cover seemed endless. Sweeping a look around, he saw that he 
was safe for the moment. He heard cries from behind him, but he could 
make out no words.   He dashed madly for the next elbow turn in 
the draw, and made it. Recklessly hurling the bronc sidewise into an 
intersecting draw, he plunged forward with undiminished speed. Gradually 
the wash climbed upward, forcing him toward open range. Yet he must 
chance it. He clambered out of the dwindling wash, the loose dirt 
flying behind him, and flashed a look about. 
Early in November the clouds lifted enough to carry out the assigned 
missions. And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks on the combat 
record. Every plane that could fly was sent into the air.

Cricket took eight ships and went south across the Straits and along 
the north coast of Mindanao to Cagayan. Anything the enemy flew 
or floated was his target. Fleischman with eight was to patrol the Leyte 
Gulf area, with his main task to get any <kamikaze> before they 
got to the ships. Greg himself took two flights, with Todman leading 
the second, to patrol and look for targets of opportunities around 
Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte. Each plane carried two five-hundred 
pound bombs.   A weapons carrier took Greg, Todman, Belton, 
Banjo Ferguson, and Walters and the others the two miles from the 
bivouac area to the strip. It was a rough long ride through the mud 
and pot holes. No one had much to say. The sky glowered down at them. 
There was a feeling that this mission would be canceled like all the 
others and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever.

The truck dropped them off at the various revetments spread 
through the jungle. Donovan snatched Greg's chute from him with 
a belligerent motion and almost ran to the plane with it. His face was 
dark as the sky above it as he stood on the wing and waited for his 
pilot. Greg climbed into the cockpit feeling as if he had never been 
in one before. But his hands and those of Donovan moved automatically 
adjusting and arranging in the check-out procedure.   "I've 
got her as neat as I can", Donovan said, as he dropped the straps 
of the Seton harness over Greg's shoulders. "But this goddamn 
climate. It's for carabao not airplanes".   "We'll make 
out. Don't you worry, chief", Greg replied, wondering if he himself 
believed it.   "Yeah. See you", Donovan said as he jumped 
off the wing. The expression was his trade-mark, his open sesame to 
good luck, and his prayer that pilot and plane would always return. 
At the prearranged time, Greg started the engine and taxied out. From 
the time the chocks were pulled until the plane was out of sight, 
he knew Donovan would keep his back to the strip. He wondered where 
the superstition had originated that it was bad luck for a crew chief 
to watch his plane take off on a combat mission. Yet long before the 
scheduled time for return, Donovan would be watching for every speck 
in the sky.   Greg rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip, and 
one by one the seven members of his flight fell in behind him. The dark 
brown bombs hanging under each wing looked large and powerful. The 
pilots' heads looked ridiculously small. The control tower gave him 
immediate take-off permission, and the clean roar of the engine that 
took him off the rough strip spoke well of the skill of Donovan.

Greg's mission was the last to leave, and as he circled the ships 
off Tacloban he saw the clouds were dropping down again. To the west, 
the dark green hills of Leyte were lost in the clouds about halfway 
up their slopes. Underneath him the sea was a dark and muddied gray. 
Water splashed against his windshield as he led the flight in and 
out of showers. The metal strip they had taken off from was coal black 
against the green jungle around it. He possessed the fighter pilot's 
horror of bad weather and instrument flying, and he wondered, if 
the ceiling did drop, whether he and the other flights would be able to 
find their way back in this unfamiliar territory. He shivered in the 
warm cockpit.   The overcast was solid above him. As far as he 
could see there was no hole to climb through it. They would have to 
go west through the narrow river valley that separated Leyte from Samar 
and hope that it didn't close in before they returned.   Greg 
pushed the radio button on his throttle. "Todman, let's try 
to go under this stuff. Stay in close and we'll go up the valley".

"Roger, Sweeney", Todman called back, and pulled his four 
in and slightly above Greg.   Greg took the formation wide 
around three ~A-26 attack bombers that were headed north over the Gulf. 
He dropped down to five hundred feet, swinging a little north of 
the city of Tacloban, and punched into the opening that showed against 
the mountain.   The valley was only a few hundred yards wide 
with just about room enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty-degree 
turn. It was only a fifteen-minute flight, but before it was 
through Greg felt 
himself developing a case of claustrophobia. The ceiling 
stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet, and at times 
the sheer cliffs seemed about to close in. If the other pilots were worried, 
they did not show it. The formation remained perfect. 
When the sea was visible ahead of them, the relief was as great as if 
the sun had come out. He spread the flight out and led them across a 
point of land and then down the coast. Although they drew light ground 
fire they saw no signs of activity.   Once Todman thought he 
had spotted a tank and went down to investigate while Greg covered him. 
"Somebody beat us to it"! Todman said over the radio as he 
came back up in formation.   Visibility continued to be limited, 
and Greg was never able to get above a thousand feet. It was frustrating. 
His earphones were constantly full of the sounds of enemy contacts 
made by other flights. He thought once that he identified the somewhat 
hysterical voice of Fleischman claiming a kill. But Greg's 
area remained as placid as a Florida dawn.   Finally, as time 
began to run out, he headed into Ormoc and glide-bombed a group of houses 
that Intelligence had thought might contain Japanese supplies. 
The low clouds made bombing difficult. There was not enough room to 
make the usual vertical bomb run. The accuracy was deplorable. One 
of Greg's bombs hung up, and he was miles from the target before he 
could get rid of it. Only one of the flight scored a direct hit and 
the rest blew up jungle.   With their load of bombs gone, the planes 
moved swiftly and easily. Greg went up tight against the ceiling 
and led them back to their pass to home. Mercifully, it was still open. 
Like a man making a deep dive, Greg took full breath and plunged 
back into the valley. He was about to make a gas check on his flight 
when Todman's voice broke in: "Sweeneys! Three bogies. Twelve 
o'clock level".   Greg's eyes flicked up from his instrument 
panel. He saw them, specks against the gray, but closing fast. 
They were headed straight for each other on a collision course. Friend 
or enemy? The same old question. And only a few seconds to answer 
it.   "Zeros"! Todman said excitedly, and hopefully.

And then he thought Todman might be right. His mind flicked 
through the mental pictures he had from the hours of Aircraft Identification. 
He narrowed the shape down to two: either a Zero or a U&
