
To encourage exploration for domestic sources of minerals, 
the Office of Minerals Exploration (~OME) of the U&S& 
Department of the Interior offers financial assistance to firms 
and individuals who desire to explore their properties or claims for 
1 or more of the 32 mineral commodities listed in the ~OME regulations. 
_REQUIREMENTS_ This help is offered to applicants who ordinarily 
would not undertake the exploration under present conditions or 
circumstances at their sole expense and who are unable to obtain funds 
from commercial sources on reasonable terms. Each applicant is required 
to own or have sufficient interest in the property to be explored. 
The Government will contract with an eligible applicant to pay up 
to one-half of the cost of approved exploration work as it progresses. 
The applicant pays the rest of the cost, but his own time spent on the 
work and charges for the use of equipment which he owns may be applied 
toward his share of the cost. _REPAYMENT_ Funds contributed by 
the Government are repaid by a royalty on production from the property. 
If nothing is produced, there is no obligation to repay. A 5-percent 
royalty is paid on any production during the period the contract 
is in effect; if the Government certifies that production may be 
possible from the property, the royalty obligation continues for the 
10-year period usually specified in the contract or until the Government's 
contribution is repaid with interest. The royalty applies to 
both principal and interest, but it never exceeds 5 percent. _CONTACT_ 
Information, application forms, and assistance in filing may be 
obtained from the Office of Minerals Exploration, U&S& Department 
of the Interior, Washington 25, D&C&, or from the appropriate

In most of the less developed countries, however, such programing 
is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent. Only a very few of 
the more advanced ones, such as India and Pakistan, have developed 
systematic techniques of programing.   Others have so-called development 
plans, but some of these are little more than lists of projects 
collected from various ministries while others are statements of goals 
without analysis of the actions required to attain them. Only rarely 
is attention given to accurate progress reports and evaluation. _WE 
CAN HELP IN THE PLANNING PROCESS_ Neither growth nor a development 
program can be imposed on a country; it must express the nation's 
own will and goal. Nevertheless, we can administer an aid program 
in such a manner as to promote the development of responsible programing.

<First>, we can encourage responsibility by establishing 
as conditions for assistance on a substantial and sustained scale the 
definition of objectives and the assessment of costs.   <Second>, 
we can make assistance for particular projects conditional on 
the consistency of such projects with the program.   <Third>, 
we can offer technical help in the formulation of programs for development 
which are adapted to the country's objectives and resources. This 
includes assistance in- **h assembling the basic economic, financial, 
technological, and educational information on which programing depends; 
**h surveying the needs and requirements over time of broad 
sectors of the economy, such as transport, agriculture, communication, 
industry, and power; **h designing the financial mechanisms of the 
economy in ways that will promote growth without inflation; and **h 
administrative practices which will make possible the more effective 
review and implementation of programs once established. _WE MUST USE 
COMMON SENSE IN APPLYING CONDITIONS_ The application of conditions 
in the allocation 
of aid funds cannot, of course, be mechanical. It must 
be recognized that countries at different stages of development have 
very different capabilities of meeting such conditions. To insist 
on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond 
the capabilities of the recipient country would result in the frustration 
of the basic objective of our development assistance to encourage 
more rapid growth.   In the more primitive areas, where the capacity 
to absorb and utilize external assistance is limited, some activities 
may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support them 
before a well worked out program is available. Thus, we might provide 
limited assistance in such fields as education, essential transport, 
communications, and agricultural improvement despite the absence of 
acceptable country programs. In such a case, however, we would encourage 
the recipient country to get on with its programing task, supply 
it with substantial technical assistance in performing that task, and 
make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of our assistance 
to the country's development was conditional upon programing progress 
being made.   At the other end of the spectrum, where the 
more advanced countries can be relied upon to make well thought through 
decisions as to project priorities within a consistent program, we should 
be prepared to depart substantially from detailed project approval 
as the basis for granting assistance and to move toward long-term support, 
in cooperation with other developed countries, of the essential 
foreign exchange requirements of the country's development program. 

#D. ENCOURAGING SELF-HELP#

_1. THE REASONS FOR STRESSING SELF-HELP_ 
A systematic approach to development budgeting and programing 
is one important kind of self-help. There are many others. It is vitally 
important that the new U&S& aid program should encourage all 
of them, since the main thrust for development must come from the less 
developed countries themselves. External aid can only be marginal, 
although the margin, as in the case of the Marshall plan, can be decisive. 
External aid can be effective only if it is a complement to self-help. 
U&S& aid, therefore, should increasingly be designed to 
provide incentives for countries to take the steps that only they themselves 
can take. _AID ADVICE IS NOT INTERFERENCE_ In establishing 
conditions of self-help, it is important that we not expect countries 
to remake themselves in our image. Open societies can take many forms, 
and within very broad limits recipients must be free to set their 
own goals and to devise their own institutions to achieve those goals. 
On the other hand, it is no interference with sovereignty to point 
out defects where they exist, such as that a plan calls for factories 
without power to run them, or for institutions without trained personnel 
to staff them. Once we have made clear that we are genuinely concerned 
with a country's development potential, we can be blunt in suggesting 
the technical conditions that must be met for development to occur. 
_2. THE RANGE OF SELF-HELP_ The major areas of self-help 
are the following: _(A) THE EFFECTIVE MOBILIZING OF RESOURCES._ 
This includes not only development programing, but also establishing 
tax policies designed to raise equitably resources for investment; 
fiscal and monetary policies designed to prevent serious inflation; 
and regulatory policies aimed to attract the financial and managerial 
resources of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury 
consumption by a few. _(B) THE REDUCTION OF DEPENDENCE ON EXTERNAL 
SOURCES._ This includes foreseeing balance-of-payments crises, 
with adequate attention to reducing dependence on imports and adopting 
realistic exchange rates to encourage infant industries and spur exports. 
It also includes providing for the training of nationals to operate 
projects after they are completed. _(C) TAPPING THE ENERGIES OF 
THE ENTIRE POPULATION._ For both economic and political reasons 
all segments of the population must be able to share in the growth 
of a country. Otherwise, development will not lead to longrun stability. 
_(D) HONESTY IN GOVERNMENT._ In many societies, what we 
regard as corruption, favoritism, and personal influence are so accepted 
as consistent with the mores of officialdom and so integral a part 
of 
routine administrative practice that any attempt to force their elimination 
will be regarded by the local leadership as not only unwarranted 
but unfriendly. Yet an economy cannot get the most out of its resources 
if dishonesty, corruption, and favoritism are widespread. Moreover, 
tolerance by us of such practices results in serious waste and diversion 
of aid resources and in the long run generates anti-American 
sentiment of a kind peculiarly damaging to our political interest. Some 
of the most dramatic successes of communism in winning local support 
can be traced to the identification- correct or not- of Communist 
regimes with personal honesty and pro-Western regimes with corruption. 
A requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically 
uncomfortable in the short run, but it is politically essential 
in the long run. _3. U&S& POSITION ON SELF-HELP_ The United 
States can use its aid as an incentive to self-help by responding with 
aid on a sustained basis, tailored to priority needs, to those countries 
making serious efforts in self-help.   In many instances it 
can withhold or limit its aid to countries not yet willing to make such 
efforts.   There are other countries where, with skillful diplomacy, 
we may be able by our aid to give encouragement to those groups 
in government which would like to press forward with economic and social 
reform measures to promote growth. Governments are rarely monolithic.

But there will be still other countries where, despite 
the inadequacy of the level of self-help, we shall deem it wise, for political 
or military reasons, to give substantial economic assistance. 
Even in these cases we should promote self-help by making it clear that 
our supporting assistance is subject to reduction and ultimately to 
termination. 

#E. ENCOURAGING A LONG-TERM APPROACH#

_1. DEVELOPMENT 
REQUIRES A LONG-TERM APPROACH_ The most fundamental concept of 
the new approach to economic aid is the focusing of our attention, our 
resources, and our energies on the effort to promote the economic and 
social development of the less developed countries. This is not a short-run 
goal. To have any success in this effort, we must ourselves view 
it as an enterprise stretching over a considerable number of years, 
and we must encourage the recipients of our aid to view it in the same 
fashion. _MOST OF OUR AID WILL GO TO THOSE NEARING SELF-SUFFICIENCY_ 
How long it will take to show substantial success in this effort 
will vary greatly from country to country. In several significant cases, 
such as India, a decade of concentrated effort can launch these 
countries into a stage in which they can carry forward their own economic 
and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance. 
These cases in which light is already visible at the other 
end of the tunnel are ones which over the next few years will absorb 
the bulk of our capital assistance. _GRADUALLY OTHERS WILL MOVE UP TO 
THE SAME LEVEL_ The number of countries thus favorably situated is 
small, but their peoples constitute over half of the population of the 
underdeveloped world. Meantime, over the decade of the sixties, we 
can hope that many other countries will ready themselves for the big 
push into self-sustaining growth. In still others which are barely on 
the threshold of the transition into modernity, the decade can bring 
significant progress in launching the slow process of developing their 
human resources and their basic services to the point where an expanded 
range of developmental activities is possible. _AID IS A LONG-TERM 
PROCESS_ The whole program must be conceived of as an effort, stretching 
over a considerable number of years, to alter the basic social 
and economic conditions in the less developed world. It must be recognized 
as a slow-acting tool designed to prevent political and military 
crises such as those recently confronted in Laos and Cuba. It is 
not a tool for dealing with these crises after they have erupted. _2. 
THE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR A LONG-TERM APPROACH_ _(A) THE NEED TO 
BUDGET A PERIOD OF YEARS._ Many of the individual projects for 
which development assistance is required call for expenditures over lengthy 
periods. Dams, river development schemes, transportation networks, 
educational systems require years to construct. Moreover, on complex 
projects, design work must be completed and orders for machinery 
and equipment placed months or even years before construction can commence. 
Thus, as a development program is being launched, commitments and 
obligations must be entered into in a given year which may exceed by 
twofold or threefold the expenditures to be made in that year. The
