of Alfred North Whitehead.   What makes this long and diverse 
tradition essentially <one> is that those who have belonged to it 
have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively 
modern world. Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely 
within the tradition of the apostolic church, they have exhibited 
no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity. 
They have insisted, rather, on living fully and completely 
within modern culture and, so far from considering this treason to God, 
have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him.

When we say, then, that today, in our situation, the demand for 
demythologization must be accepted without condition, we are simply 
saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring 
achievement. However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's 
constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves must strive 
to formulate can only go <beyond> liberalism, not <behind> it.

In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking 
the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a 
theology has led. For we have said, in effect, that of the two alternatives 
to his position variously represented by the other participants 
in the demythologizing discussion, only one is really an alternative. 
If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be 
accepted 
by theology unconditionally, the position of the "right" is 
clearly untenable. Whereas Bultmann's "center" position is structurally 
inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds 
alone, the general position of the "right", as represented, say, 
by Karl Barth, involves the rejection or at least qualification of 
the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material 
grounds we have just considered.   It follows, then, provided 
the possibilities have been exhausted, that the only <real> alternative 
is the general viewpoint of the "left", which has been represented 
on the Continent by Fritz Buri and, to some extent at least, 
is found in much that is significant in American and English theology.

In order to make the implications of our position as clear 
as possible, we may develop this argument at greater length.   We 
may show, first, that there cannot possibly be an alternative other 
than the three typically represented by Bultmann, Barth, and Buri. 
To do this, it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms 
of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more 
than two, then the question of a "third" possibility is a meaningless 
question. Thus, if what is at issue is whether "All ~S 
is ~P", it is indifferent whether "Some ~S is not ~P" 
or "No ~S is ~P", since in either case the judgment in question 
is false. Hence, if what is in question is whether in a given theology 
myth is or is not completely rejected, it is unimportant whether 
only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted; 
for, in either event, the first possibility is excluded. Therefore, 
the only conceivable alternatives are those represented, on the one hand, 
by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive 
positions of Buri and Barth and, on the other hand, by the third 
but really pseudo position (analogous to a round square) of Bultmann.

A second point requires more extended comment. It will be recalled 
from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the "right", 
as represented by Barth, rests on the following thesis: The 
only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that 
(1) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization 
and existential interpretation; (2) accepts instead a 
special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation; and (3) 
in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus 
Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's point of 
view, are mythological.

ONE HUNDRED years ago there existed in England the Association 
for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom. Representing 
as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman 
and Anglican Churches, and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable 
to Rome, this association produced little fruit, and, in fact, was 
condemned by the Holy Office in 1864.   Now again in 1961, in 
England, there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly 
discussed as Christian unity. The Church Unity Octave, January 
18-25, was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various 
churches. Many people seem hopeful, yet it is difficult to predict 
whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian 
unity in 1961 than there was in 1861. But it must be readily seen 
that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these 
hundred years as to engender hope, at least on the Catholic side. 
For the "tide is well on the turn", as the London Catholic weekly 
<Universe> has written.   I came to England last summer to 
do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman. As an 
American Catholic of Irish ancestry, I came with certain preconceptions 
and expectations; being intellectually influenced by Newman 
and the general 19th-century literature of England, I knew only a 
Protestant-dominated 
country. Since arriving here, however, I have formed 
a far different religious picture of present-day England. In representing 
part of this new picture, I will be recounting some of my 
own personal experiences, reactions and judgments; but my primary aim 
is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing 
and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the 
present religious 
state of England.   Since the Protestant clergy for the 
most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit, my Roman 
collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman 
Catholic cleric. In any case, I have always been treated with the 
utmost courtesy by Englishmen, even in Devonshire and Cornwall, where 
anti-Catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest.

Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-Catholicism. 
On my first Guy Fawkes Day here, I found Catholics as well 
as non-Catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires, 
and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not 
concerned with the historical significance of the day. A Birmingham 
newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled "The 
True Story of Guy Fawkes", which began:   "When you 
pile your 
"guy" on the bonfire tomorrow night, I wonder how much of the 
true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember? In the 355 years since 
the first Guy Fawkes Night, much of the story has been forgotten, 
so here is a reminder". The article proceeded to give an inaccurate 
account of a catholic plot to kill King James /1,. ##

IN 
SPITE OF the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the 
conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's, 
the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very 
small one (four per cent, or 800,000) which did not enjoy a gracious 
hearing from the general public. The return of the Catholic hierarchy 
in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and, in fact, 
was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty. In 1864 Newman professedly 
had to write his <Apologia> with his keenest feelings in 
order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers.

Now, in 1961, the Catholic population of England is still 
quite small (ten per cent, or 5 million); yet it represents a very 
considerable percentage of the churchgoing population. A Protestant 
woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham 
Oratory (Catholic) Church on Sunday mornings. She found 
this a marvel because, as she said, only six per cent of English people 
are churchgoers. She may not have been exact on this number, but 
others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than 
ten. From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly 
attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during 
services. A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of 
a large city university, following Anglican evensong, at which there 
was a congregation of twelve, he celebrated Mass before more than a 
hundred.   The Protestants themselves are the first to admit the 
great falling off in effective membership in their churches. According 
to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England, 
the "total of confirmed members is 9,748,000, but only 2,887,671 
are registered on the parochial church rolls", and "over 27 million 
people in England are baptized into the Church of England, but 
roughly only a tenth of them continue". An amazing article in the 
<Manchester Guardian> of last November, entitled "Fate of Redundant 
Churches", states than an Archbishops' Commission "reported 
last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 
churches which are redundant now, or will be in 20 years' time. A further 
260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948". And 
in the last five years, the "Methodist chapel committee has 
authorized 
the demolition or, more often, the sale of 764 chapels". Most of 
these former churches are now used as warehouses, but "neither Anglicans 
nor 
Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics", 
and have done so.   While it must be said that these same 
Protestants have built some new churches during this period, and that 
religious population shifts have emptied churches, a principal reason 
for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are 
going to church. It should be admitted, too, that there is a good 
percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics (one paper writes 50 
per cent). Still, it is clear from such reports, and apparently clear 
from the remarks of many people, that Protestants are decreasing and 
Catholics increasing.   An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly 
but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true. A century ago, 
Newman saw that liberalism (what we now might call secularism) would 
gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism, and 
that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a "serviceable 
breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own". 
That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems no longer very meaningful 
to call England a "Protestant country". One of the ironies 
of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively 
speaking, many real Christians to unite.   Many English 
Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are 
in a new ascendancy. The London <Universe> devoted its centenary 
issue 
last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress 
during the last one hundred years. With traditional nationalistic spirit, 
some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism 
at its best. I have found myself saying with other foreigners here 
that English Catholics <are> good Catholics. It has been my experience 
to find as many men as women in church, and to hear almost everyone 
in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses 
at Mass.   They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-Catholic 
population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday Benediction 
they recite by heart the "Prayer for England":   "O Blessed 
Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother, 
look down in mercy upon England, thy "dowry", and upon us 
all who greatly hope and trust in thee **h. Intercede for our separated 
brethren, that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the 
chief Shepherd, the vicar of thy Son **h". A hymn often to be 
heard in Catholic churches is "Faith of our Fathers", which glories 
in England's ancient faith that endured persecution, and which 
proclaims: "Faith of our Fathers: Mary's prayers/Shall win 
our country back to thee". The English saints are widely venerated, 
quite naturally, and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs 
and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized.   Because they 
have kept the faith of their medieval fathers, English Catholics have
