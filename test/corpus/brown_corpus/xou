Brandon dreamed. <He was sitting 
on top of a log which was spinning round and around in the water. A 
river, wide as the Missouri, where it ran by his place. The log was 
spinning. But he was not>. So what? Why should I be spinning just 
because the goddamn log is spinning? (he asked this out loud, but 
no one heard it over the other noise in the hut). <Over on the bank, 
the west bank, a man stood, calling to him. He couldn't make out 
what he was saying. No doubt it had to do with the log. Why should 
he be concerned>?

Rousseau is so persuasive that Voltaire is almost convinced that 
he should burn his books, too. But while the two men are riding into 
the country, where they are going to dinner, they are attacked in 
the dark of the forest by a band of thieves, who strip them of everything, 
including most of their clothes.   "You must be a very learned 
man", says Voltaire to one of the bandits.   "A learned 
man"? the bandit laughs in his face.   But Voltaire perseveres. 
He goes to the chief himself. "At what university did you 
study"? he asks. He refuses to believe that the bandit chief never 
attended a higher institution. "To have become so corrupt", he 
says, "surely you must have studied many arts and sciences".

The chief, annoyed by these questions, knocks Voltaire down and shouts 
at him that he not only never went to any school, but never even 
learned how to read.   When finally the two bedraggled men reach 
their friend's home, Voltaire's fears are once again aroused. 
For it is such a distinguished place, with such fine works of art and 
such a big library, that there can be little doubt but that the owner 
has become depraved by all this culture.   To Voltaire's surprise, 
however, their host gives them fresh clothes to put on, opens his 
purse to lend them money and sits them down before a good dinner.

Immediately after dinner, however, Rousseau asks for still another 
favor. Could he have pen and paper, please? He is in a hurry 
to write another essay against culture.   Such was the impromptu 
that Voltaire gave to howls of laughter at Sans Souci and that was 
soon circulated in manuscript throughout the literary circles of Europe, 
to be printed sometime later, but with the name of Timon of Athens, 
the famous misanthrope, substituted for that of Rousseau. 
How cruel!   But at the same time how understandable. How could 
the rich, for whom life was made so simple, ever understand the subterfuges, 
the lies, the frauds, the errors, sins and even crimes to 
which the poor were driven in their efforts to overcome the great advantages 
the rich had in the race of life?   How, for example, 
could a Voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a Rousseau 
would find himself when, soon after the furor of his first <Discourse,> 
he acquired still another title to fame?   This time 
as a musician. As a composer.   Ever since he had first begun 
to study music and to teach it, Rousseau had dreamed of piercing through 
to fame as the result of a successful opera. But his facility in 
this genre was not great. And his efforts to get a performance for his 
<Gallant Muses> invariably failed. And for good reasons. His 
operatic music had little merit.   But then one day, while on a 
week's visit to the country home of a retired Swiss jeweler, Rousseau 
amused the company with a few little melodies he had written, to which 
he attached no great importance. He was really amazed to discover 
the other guests so excited about these delicate little songs.

"Put a few such songs together", they urged him. "String them 
onto some sort of little plot, and you'll have a delightful operetta".

He didn't believe them. "Nonsense", he said. "This 
is the sort of stuff I write and then throw away"!   "Heaven 
forbid"! cried the ladies, enchanted by his music. "You 
must make an opera out of this material".   And they wouldn't 
leave off arguing and pleading until he had promised.   Oh, 
the irony and the bitterness of it! That after all his years of effort 
to become a composer, he should now, now when he was still stoutly 
replying to the critics of his <Discourse on the Arts and Sciences,> 
be so close to a success in music and have to reject it. 
Or at least appear to reject it!   But what else could he do? 
You couldn't on the one hand decry the arts and at the same time 
practice them, could you? Well, yes, perhaps in literature, since 
you could argue that you couldn't keep silent about your feelings against 
literature and so were involved in spite of yourself. But now music 
too? No. That would be too much!   And the fault, of 
course, was Rameau's. The fault was Rameau's and that of the whole 
culture of this Parisian age. For it was Rameau's type of music 
that he had been trying to write, and that he couldn't write. These 
little songs, however, were sweet nothings from the heart, tender 
memories of his childhood, little melodies that anyone could hum and 
that would make one want to weep.   But no. He couldn't appear 
as a composer now. That glory, craved for so long, was now forbidden 
to him. Still, just for the ladies, and just for this once, for this 
one weekend in the country, he would make a little piece out of his 
melodies.   The ladies were delighted and Jean Jacques was applauded. 
And everyone went to work to learn the parts which he wrote.

But then, after the little operetta had been given its feeble 
amateur rendering, everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost 
forever, and that the Royal Academy of Music must now have the manuscript 
in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merited.

Rousseau was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite, standing 
there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance. 
The ladies especially couldn't understand what troubled him. 
A contradiction? Bah, what was a contradiction in one's life? 
Every woman has had the experience of saying no when she meant yes, 
and saying yes when she meant no.   Rousseau had to admit that 
though he couldn't agree to a public performance, he would indeed, 
just for his own private satisfaction, dearly love to know how his work 
would sound when done by professional musicians and by trained voices.

"I'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people 
seem to think", he said.   Duclos, the historian, pointed 
out to Jean Jacques that this was impossible. The musicians of the 
Royal Opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound. 
Merely to satisfy the author's curiosity.   Rousseau agreed. 
But he recalled that Rameau had once had a private performance 
of his opera <Armide,> behind closed doors, just for himself alone.

Duclos understood what was bothering Rousseau: that the writer 
of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the 
writer of an amusing little operetta. That would certainly be paradoxical. 
But Duclos thought he saw a way out.   "Let me do the 
submitting to the Royal Academy", he suggested. "Your name will 
never appear. No one will even suspect that it is your work".

To that Rousseau could agree.   But now what crazy twists 
and turns of his emotions!   Afraid at one and the same time 
that his work might be turned down- which would be a blow to his pride 
even though no one knew he was the author- and that the work would 
be accepted, and then that his violent feelings in the matter would 
certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself. And 
how anxious this lover of obscurity was for applause! And thus torn 
between his desire to be known as the composer of a successful opera 
and the necessity of remaining true to his proclaimed desire for anonymity, 
Rousseau suffered through several painful weeks.   All these 
emotions were screwed up to new heights when, after acceptance and 
the first rehearsals, there ensued such a buzz of excitement among Parisian 
music lovers that Duclos had to come running to Rousseau to 
inform him that the news had reached the superintendent of the King's 
amusements, and that he was now demanding that the work be offered 
first at the royal summer palace of Fontainebleau. Imagine the honor 
of it!   "What was your answer"? Jean Jacques asked, 
striving to appear unimpressed.   "I refused", Duclos said. 
"What else could I do? Monsieur de Cury was incensed, of course. 
But I said I would first have to get the author's permission. 
And I was certain he would refuse".   How infuriating all 
this was! Why had not this success come to him before he had plunged 
into his <Discourse,> and before he had committed himself to a life 
of austerity and denial? Now, when everything was opening up to 
him- even the court of Louis /15,!- he had to play a role of 
self-effacement.   Back and forth Duclos had to go, between M& 
de Cury and Jean Jacques and between the Duke d'Aumont and Jean 
Jacques again, as his little operetta, <The Village Soothsayer,> 
though still unperformed, took on ever more importance.   And 
of course the news of who the composer was did finally begin to get 
around among his closest friends. But they, naturally, kept his secret 
well, and the public at large knew only of a great excitement in musical 
and court circles.   How titillating it was to go among people 
who did not know him as the composer, but who talked in the most 
glowing terms of the promise of the piece after having heard the first 
rehearsals. The furor was such that people who could not possibly have 
squirmed their way into the rehearsals were pretending that they were 
intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational. And 
listening to such a conversation one morning while taking a cup of 
chocolate in a cafe, Rousseau found himself bathed in perspiration, 
trembling lest his authorship become known, and at the same time dreaming 
of the startling effect he would make if he should proclaim himself 
suddenly as the composer.   He felt himself now, as he himself 
says in his <Confessions,> at a crucial point of his life. And that 
was why, on the day of the performance, when a carriage from the royal 
stables called to take him to the palace, he did not bother to shave. 
On the contrary, he was pleased that his face showed a neglect of 
several days.   Seeing him in that condition, and about to enter 
the hall where the King, the Queen, the whole royal family and all 
the members of the highest aristocracy would be present, Grimm and the 
Abbe Raynal and others tried to stop him.   "You can't 
go in that way"! they cried.   "Why not"? Jean Jacques 
asked. "Who is going to stop me"?   "You haven't dressed 
for the occasion"! they pointed out to him.   "I'm 
dressed as I always am", Rousseau said. "Neither better nor worse".

"At home, yes", they argued. "But here you are 
in the palace. There's the King. And Madame de Pompadour".
