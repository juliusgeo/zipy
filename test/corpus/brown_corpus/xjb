Hoover, the chief usher, had Mama check her fur coat when she came 
in, and take care of her needs. Mama said she was one of the prettiest 
ladies she had ever seen.   Mama was very patriotic, and one of 
the duties she was proudest of was repairing the edges of the flag that 
flew above the White House. Actually, two flags were used at the 
mansion- a small one on rainy days, and a big one on bright days. 
The wool would become frazzled around the edges from blowing in the wind, 
and Mama would mend it. She would often go up on the roof to see 
the attendant take down the flag in the evening. She used to tell me, 
"When I stand there and look at the flag blowing this way and that 
way, I have the wonderful, safe feeling that Americans are protected 
no matter which way the wind blows".   Even when Mrs& 
Coolidge was in mourning for her son, she reached out to help other people 
in trouble. One person she helped was my brother. Mama had told 
her how Emmett's lungs had been affected when he was gassed in the 
war. He was in and out of Mount Alto Hospital for veterans any number 
of times.   Taking a personal interest, she had the doctor 
assigned to the White House, Dr& James Coupal, look Emmett over. 
As a result, he was sent to a hospital in Arizona until his health 
improved enough for him to come back to Washington to work in the 
Government service. But again, there was danger that his lungs would 
suffer in the muggy Washington weather, and he had to return to the 
dry climate of the West to live and work.   When Mrs& Coolidge 
was in mourning, she did not wear black. She wore grey every day, 
and white every evening. Mama knew that she was out of mourning when 
she finally wore bright colors. The President helped her a lot by selecting 
some lovely colored dresses to get her started. She opened the 
boxes with a tear in her eye and a sad smile on her face.   On 
the social side, the chore Mama had at the formal receptions at the 
White House thrilled her the most. It was her job to stand at the 
foot of the stairs, and, just as the First Lady stepped off the last 
tread, Mama would straighten out her long train before she marched to 
the Blue Room to greet her guests with the President. Mama would 
enjoy the sight of the famous guests as much as anyone, and would note 
a gown here and there to tell me about that night.   One night, 
Mama came home practically in a state of shock. She had stood at the 
bottom of the stairs, as usual, when Mrs& Coolidge came down, in 
the same dress that is now in the Smithsonian, to greet her guests. 
Mama stooped down to fix the train, but there was no train there! She 
reached and reached around the dress, but there was nothing there. 
She looked up and saw that, without knowing it, Mrs& Coolidge was 
holding it aloft. Mrs& Coolidge looked down, saw Mama's horrified 
expression and quickly let the whole thing fall to the floor. Mama 
swirled the train in place, and not a step was lost.   The Coolidges 
did not always live at the White House during the Presidency.

Impressive as this enumeration is, it barely hints at the diverse 
perceptions of Jews, collectively or individually, that have been 
attested by their Gentile environment. It is reasonable to affirm 
two propositions: <Jews have been perceived by non-Jews as all things 
to all men; some Jews have in fact been all things to all men>. 
In the arena of power Jews have at one time or another been somebody's 
ally; they have observed correct neutrality; they have been 
someone's enemy. In the market place Jews have in fact under various 
circumstances been valued customers and suppliers, or clannish monopolists 
and cutthroat competitors. And so on through the roles referred 
to in the previous paragraph. Diversity of perception, yes; diversity 
of fact, yes.   But the two do not invariably or even 
typically coincide. The "conventional" image of a particular time 
and place is not necessarily congruent with the image of the facts as 
established over the years by scholarly and scientific research. Conventional 
images of Jews have this in common with all perceptions of 
a configuration in which one feature is held constant: images can be 
both true and false.   The genuinely interesting question, then, 
becomes: What factors determine the degree of realism or distortion 
in conventional images of Jews? The working test of "the facts" 
must always be the best available description obtainable from scholars 
and scientists who have applied their methods of investigation 
to relevant situations. Granted, such "functional" images are subject 
to human error; they are self-correcting in the sense that they 
are subject to disciplined procedures that check and recheck against 
error.   In accounting for realism or distortion two sets of factors 
can be usefully distinguished: current intelligence; predispositions 
regarding intelligence. General Grant may have been the victim 
of false information in the instance reported in this book; if so, 
he would not be the first or last commanding officer who has succumbed 
to bad information and dubious estimates of the future. But General 
Grant may have been self-victimized. He may have entered the situation 
with predispositions that prepared him to act uncritically in the 
press of affairs.   Predispositions, in turn, fall conveniently 
into two categories for purposes of analysis. To some extent predispositions 
are shaped by exposure to group environments. In some measure 
they depend upon the structure of individual personality. The anti-Semitism 
of Hitler owed something to his exposure to the ideology of 
Lueger's politically successful Christian socialist movement in Vienna. 
But millions of human beings were exposed to Lueger's propaganda 
and record. After allowing for group exposures, it is apparent 
that other factors must be considered if we are to comprehend fanaticism. 
These are personality factors; they include harmonies and conflicts 
within the whole man, and mechanisms whereby inner components are 
more or less smoothly met. Modern psychiatric knowledge provides us 
with many keys to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind.

The foregoing factors are pertinent to the analysis of perceptual 
images and the broad conditions under which they achieve realism or 
fall short of it. Undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of Gentile 
conceptions of the Jew unfolded in the present anthology is that 
it provides a formidable body of material that invites critical examination 
in terms of reality. Many selections are themselves convincing 
contributions to this appraisal.   Undoubtedly, however, the significance 
of the volume is greater than the foregoing paragraphs suggest. 
Speaking as a non-Jew I believe that its primary contribution is 
in the realm of future policy. Since we can neither undo nor redo the 
past, we are limited to the events of today and tomorrow. In this 
domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local, national, and 
world community is enough to guarantee that we cannot refrain from having 
some effect, large or small, upon Gentile-Jewish relations. What 
shall these effects be?   I am deliberately raising the policy 
problems involved in Gentile-Jewish relations. Comprehensive examination 
of any policy question calls for the performance of the intellectual 
tasks inseparable from any problem-solving method. The tasks 
are briefly indicated by these questions: What are my goals in Gentile-Jewish 
relations? What are the historical trends in this country 
and abroad in the extent to which these goals are effectively realized? 
What factors condition the degree of realization at various 
times and places? What is the probable course of future developments? 
What policies if adopted and applied in various circumstances will 
increase the likelihood that future events will coincide with desired 
events and do so at least cost in terms of all human values?

It is beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy questions 
of such depth and range. The discussion is therefore limited to a 
suggested procedure for realizing at least some of the potential importance 
of this volume for future policy. As a groundwork for the proposal 
I give some attention to the first task enumerated above, the clarification 
of goal.   My reply is that I associate myself with 
all those who affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations should contribute 
to the theory and practice of human dignity. The basic goal finds partial 
expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a statement 
initiated and endorsed by individuals and organizations of many 
religious and philosophical traditions.   Within this frame of 
reference policies appropriate to claims advanced in the name of the 
Jews depend upon which Jewish identity is involved, as well as upon 
the nature of the claim, the characteristics of the claimant, the justifications 
proposed, and the predispositions of the community decision 
makers who are called upon to act. If Jews are identified as a religious 
body in a controversy that comes before a national or international 
tribunal, it is obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity 
to protect freedom of worship. When decision makers act within this 
frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion 
is to be accepted by the larger community as appropriate to religion. 
Since the recognition of Israel as a nation state, claims are made 
in many cases which identify the claimant as a member of the new body 
politic. Community decision makers must make up their minds whether 
a claim is acceptable to the larger community in terms of prevailing 
expectations regarding members of nation states. In free countries 
many controversies involve self-styled Jews who use the symbol in asserting 
a vaguely "cultural" rather than religious or political identity. 
The decision maker who acts for the community as a whole must 
decide whether the objectives pursued and the methods used are appropriate 
to public policy regarding cultural groups.   We know that 
much is made of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identities that 
cluster around the key symbol of the Jew. Many public and private controversies 
will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusions in 
the mind and usage of Gentile and Jew. However, in the context of legal 
and civic policy, these controversies are less than novel. They 
involve similar uncertainties regarding the multiple identities of any 
number of non-Jewish groups. So far as the existing body of formal 
principle and procedure is concerned, categorical novelties are not 
to be anticipated in Jewish-Gentile relationships; claims are properly 
disposed of according to norms common to all parties.   It 
is not implied that formal principles and procedures are so firmly entrenched 
within the public order of the world community or even of free 
commonwealths that they will control in all circumstances involving Jews 
and Gentiles during coming years. Social process is always anchored 
in past predisposition; but it is perennially restructured in situations 
where anchors are dragged or lost. In conformance with the 
maximization principle we affirm that Gentile-Jewish relations will 
be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the 
other is expected by the active participants to yield the greatest net 
advantage, taking all value outcomes and effects into consideration. 
It is not difficult to anticipate circumstances in which negative tensions 
will cumulate; for instance, imagine the situation if Israel 
ever joins an enemy coalition. The formal position of Americans who 
identify themselves with one or more of the several identities of the 
Jewish symbol is already clear; the future weight of informal factors 
cannot be so easily assessed.   When we consider the disorganized 
state of the world community, and the legacy of predispositions adversely 
directed against all who are identified as Jews, it is obvious 
that the struggle for the minds and muscles of men needs to be prosecuted 
with increasing vigor and skill. During moments of intense crisis 
the responsibility of political leaders is overwhelming. But their 
freedom of policy is limited by the pattern of predisposition with which 
they and the people around them enter the crisis. At such critical 
moments predispositions favorable to human dignity most obviously "pay 
off". By the same test predispositions destructive of human personality 
exercise their most sinister impact, with the result that men 
of good will are often trapped and nullified.   Among measures 
in anticipation of crisis are plans to inject into the turmoil as assistants 
of key decision makers qualified persons who are cognizant of 
the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationships and are also 
able to raise calm and realistic voices when overburdened leaders near 
the limit of self-control. We are learning how to do these things 
in some of the vast organized structures of modern society; the process 
can be accelerated.   A truism is that the time to prepare 
for the worst is when times are best. During intercrisis periods the 
educational facilities of the community have the possibility of remolding 
the perspectives and altering the behavior of vast numbers of human 
beings of every age and condition. As more men and women are made capable 
of living up to the challenge of decency the chances are improved
