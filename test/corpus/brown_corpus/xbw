out of initial reserves. In the 12 months ended in February, 1961, 
this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest.   That improvement 
is continuing. In the first two months of 1961, earnings of the 
Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent 
from early 1960.   Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard. 
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates. 
In these cases, the turnpike managements have had to turn to 
toll-rate increases, or to costly improvements such as extensions or 
better 
connections with other highways.   Many rate increases already 
have been put into effect. Higher tolls are planned for July 1, 
1961, on the Richmond-Petersburg, Va&, Turnpike, and proposals for 
increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study. 

#EASIER 
ACCESS.#

Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists' access 
to many turnpikes. The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration. 
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements 
in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb& 28, 
1961.   Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike 
are expected late in 1961, with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita, 
and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in 
both Kansas City, Kans&, and Kansas City, Mo&. Meanwhile, there 
appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover 
the interest deficiency for eight more years. 

#FOR SOME ROADS, TROUBLES.# 

Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find 
that not all roads are nearing their goals.   Traffic and revenues 
on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners 
and investors alike. If nothing is done, the prospect is that that 
road will be in default of interest in 1962. West Virginia toll bonds 
have defaulted in interest for months, and, despite recent improvement 
in revenues, holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.

These, however, are exceptions. The typical picture at this 
time is one of steady improvement.   It's going to take time 
for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in 
full. Already, however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough 
to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins. Many others are 
attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even 
point.

@ A top American official, after a look at Europe's 
factories, thinks the <U&S& is in a "very serious situation" 
competitively.>   <Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges,> 
accompanied by a member of our staff, on May 10 toured plants of 
two of Italy's biggest companies- <Fiat,> the auto producer, 
and <Olivetti,> maker of typewriters and calculating machines.

Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows-   "Follow 
Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant, and you learn this:

"One, <modern equipment>- much of it supplied under the 
Marshall Plan- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day. About 
half of these are exported.   "Two, <wage costs> are a fraction 
of the U&S& costs. A skilled worker on the assembly line, 
for example, earns $37 a week.   "Three, <labor troubles> 
are infrequent. Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more 
than six years.   "Said Secretary Hodges: 'It's a tough 
combination for the U&S& to face'.   <"Olivetti 
had a special interest> for Hodges. Olivetti took over Underwood, 
the U&S& typewriter maker, in late 1959. Within a year, without 
reducing wages, Underwood's production costs were cut one third, 
prices were slashed. The result has been that exports of Underwood 
products have doubled.   "The Olivetti plant near Turin has 
<modern layout, modern machinery.> The firm is <design-conscious, 
sales-conscious, advertising-conscious.>   "Hodges is 
trying 
to get more foreign business to go to the U&S&. The inflow 
of foreign capital would help the U&S& balance of payments.

"Hodges predicted: 'I think we will see more foreign firms 
coming to the U&S&. 
There are many places where we can use their 
vigor and new ideas'". ##

@ <Foreign competition> has 
become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new 
ways of handling competitive imports.   The recently unveiled 
<Kennedy moves to control the international textile market> can be 
significant for American businessmen in many lines.   <Important 
aspects> of the Kennedy textile plans are these:   <An 
international conference> of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting 
countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy.

<Chief aims of the proposed conference> are worth noting.

The U&S& will try to get agreement among the industrialized 
countries to <take more textile imports> from the less-developed 
countries over the years.   <Point is> that developing countries 
often build up a textile industry first, need encouragement to 
get on their feet. If they have trouble exporting, international bill 
for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.   <Idea 
is> to let these countries earn their way as much as possible. 
##

@ At the same time, <another purpose> of the conference 
will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports- 
especially dumping of specific products- to high-wage textile-producing 
countries.   <Japan,> since 1957, has been "voluntarily" 
curbing exports of textiles to the U&S&. <Hong Kong, 
India and Pakistan> have been limiting exports of certain types 
of textiles to Britain for several years under the "Lancashire Pact".

None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.

<The Japanese want to increase exports to the U&S&> 
While they have been curbing shipments, they have watched Hong Kong 
step in and capture an expanding share of the big U&S& market.

<Hong Kong interests> loudly protest limiting their exports 
to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into 
British market unrestrictedly.   <The Indians and Pakistanis> 
are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for 
similar reasons.   <The Kennedy hope> is that, at the conference 
or through bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries 
in Asia and Europe will see that "dumping" practices cause 
friction all around and may result in import quotas.   <Gradual, 
controlled expansion> of the world's textile trade is what President 
Kennedy wants. This may point the way toward international stabilization 
agreements in other products. <It's an important clue 
to Washington thinking.> ##

@ Note, too, that the Kennedy 
textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U&S& 
textile industry.   <"Get competitive or get out".> In 
veiled terms, that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to 
the American textile industry. <The Government will help> in 
transferring companies and workers into new lines, where modernization 
doesn't seem feasible. <Special depreciation> on new textile machinery 
may be allowed. <Government research> will look into new 
products and methods.   <Import quotas aren't ruled out> 
where the national interest is involved.   But the Kennedy Administration 
<doesn't favor> import quotas. Rather, they are impressed 
with the British Government's success in forcing- and helping- 
the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to 
other products.   What's happening in textiles can be <handwriting 
on the wall> for other lines having difficulty competing with 
imports from low-wage countries. ##

@ Among the highest-paid workers 
in the world are U&S& coal miners. Yet U&S& coal is 
cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water.   <Steel 
Company of Wales,> a British steelmaker, wants to bring in 
Virginia coal, cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be 
able to compete more effectively- especially in foreign markets.

<Virginia coal,> delivered by ship in Wales, will be about 
$2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.

<U&S& coal is cheap,> despite high wages, because 
of widespread mechanization of mines, wide coal seams, attactive rates 
on ocean freight. Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British 
mines are twisting, narrow and very deep.   <Productivity 
of U&S& miners> is twice that of the British.   <Welsh 
coal miners,> Communist-led, are up in arms at the suggestion that 
the steel company bring in American coal. They threaten to strike.

The British Government will have to decide whether to let 
U&S& coal in. The British coal industry is unprofitable, has large 
coal stocks it can't sell.

EVERY library borrower, or at least those whose taste goes 
beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows what it is to hear the librarian 
say apologetically, "I'm sorry, but we don't have that 
book. There wouldn't be much demand for it, I'm afraid".

Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the ever-present budget 
problem all libraries must face, from the largest to the smallest. 
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles? 
What to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction and 
nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified, when 
your budget is pitifully small? Most library budgets are hopelessly 
inadequate. A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually, 
which includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New 
York Public has enough money to meet its needs- this in the world's 
richest city. The plight of a small community library is proportionately 
worse.   Confronted with this situation, most libraries 
either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they 
can with what they have, or else depend on the bounty of patrons and 
local governments to supplement their annual funds. In some parts of 
the country, however, a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under 
the wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial help of the 
state, libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional 
basis.   New York State has what is probably the most advanced 
of these co-operative systems, so well developed that it has become 
a model for others to follow. Because it is so large a state, with 
marked contrasts in population density, the organization of the New 
York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works. At 
one extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where libraries 
in two or more counties combine to serve a large, sparsely populated 
area. At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library 
System, in a high-density area, with ample resources and a rapidly 
growing territory to serve.   Both these types, and those 
in between, are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries
