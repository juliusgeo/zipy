
#PREPARATION FOR MEMBERSHIP# 

CHURCHES THAT HAVE a carefully planned program of membership preparation 
and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members 
loyal and active. This is the answer to the problem of "membership 
delinquency".   It is important that persons desiring to 
unite with the Church be <prepared> for this experience so that it 
may be meaningful and spiritually significant. It is unfair and unchristian 
to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership 
before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.

Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after 
the commitment is received. _1)_ The pastor <writes a personal letter> 
to each individual, expressing his joy over the decision, assuring 
him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time, and outlining 
the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday. 
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported 
by the visitors. It should not be postponed later than the next day. 
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter. _2)_ The pastor 
calls in the home of each individual or family for a <spiritual guidance 
conference>. If possible, he should make an appointment in order 
that all persons involved may be present. This is <not> a social 
call. It is definitely a "spiritual guidance conference". He 
will discuss the significance of Christian commitment, the necessity 
of family religion and private devotions, and the importance of the 
membership preparation sessions. There may be problems of conduct or 
questions of belief which will require his counsel. Each conference 
should be concluded naturally with prayer. A piece of devotional material, 
such as <The Upper Room>, may be left in each home. _3)_ 
A minimum of <four sessions of preparation for membership> is necessary 
for adults. Some churches require more. None should ask less. 
Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the 
meaning of Christian discipleship <before> they take the sacred 
vows. They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper 
devotion to it if membership requires something of them.   Many 
churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time 
for adult preparation classes. Others meet on Sunday night, at the 
mid-week service, or for a series of four nights. Some pastors have 
two sessions in one evening, with a refreshment period between. 
The sessions should cover four major areas: _A_- The Christian 
Faith _B_- History of the Church _C_- Duties of Church 
Membership _D_- The Local Church and Its Program

Following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing 
with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the 
week. This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership 
packet. 

#FOURTH SESSION IMPORTANT#

MOST PASTORS FIND 
that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore 
hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday. In this session 
the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the 
work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the 
local church. The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak 
on the various phases of church life, service opportunities, the church 
school, missions, men's work, women's work, youth program, social 
activities, and finances. The budget of the church may be presented 
and pledges solicited at this session. An "interest finder" or 
"talent sheet" may be filled out by each person. (See sample on 
pp& 78-79.) The fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the 
church facilities and refreshments. The social time gives an opportunity 
for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members. 

#ADDITIONAL 
SUGGESTIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP PREPARATION#

IN CONDUCTING 
the Membership Preparation-Inquirers' Class, the pastor should 
plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest 
on the part of the class. The following have been found effective. 

_1)_ <Extend the number of classes>. Some churches have 
six or more training sessions of two hours each, generally held on Sunday 
night or during the week. This gives greater opportunity for the 
learning process. _2)_ <Use dramatization>- for example, in 
discussing the Lord's Supper or church symbolism. _3)_ <Use 
audio-visual aids>. Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion 
pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to 
enrich the class session. _4)_ <Have a "Question Box>". 
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly. Urge them 
to write out their questions for the box. _5)_ <Use a textbook> 
with assigned readings each week. _6)_ <Select class members for 
reports> on various phases of the study. _7)_ <Conduct examinations>, 
using a true-false check sheet. _8)_ <Ask each member 
to write a statement> on such topics as: "What Christ Means to 
Me", "What the Church Means to Me", "Why Join the Church", 
"The Duties of Church Members", etc&. _9)_ <Assign 
a series of catechism questions> to be memorized. _10)_ <Invite 
class members to share in an extra period of Bible study> each 
week. _11)_ <Ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty> 
to the Reception Service. 

#WHAT ABOUT TRANSFERS?#

THERE 
IS A GROWING CONVICTION among pastors and Church leaders that 
all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory 
training, including those coming by transfer of membership. George E& 
Sweazey writes: "There is danger in trying to make admission 
to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know 
that anything has happened".   People appreciate experiences 
that demand something of them. Those who transfer their membership are 
no exception to the rule. For most of them, it will be their first 
experience in membership training, since this is a recent development 
in many churches. Those coming from other denominations will welcome 
the opportunity to become informed.   The preparatory class is 
an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted 
with one another. It provides a natural transition into the life 
of the local church and its organizations. 

#RECEPTION INTO THE CHURCH 
FELLOWSHIP#

THE TOTAL PROCESS of evangelism reaches the crescendo 
when the group of new members stands before the congregation to 
declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship 
of the Church. This should be a high moment in their lives, a 
never-to-be-forgotten 
experience. They should sense the tremendous significance 
of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our 
Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.

Every detail of the service merits careful attention- the 
hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of fellowship, the introduction 
to the congregation, the welcome of the congregation. This is 
a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation. It will help 
to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church. It 
can mean the difference between participation and inaction, spiritual 
growth and decay.   The worship service is the natural and logical 
time to receive new members into the Church. The atmosphere for 
this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the 
worship experience. Psychologically the reception should be the 
climax, following the sermon. _1)_ Ask the new members to meet thirty 
minutes before the service to complete "talent sheets" and pledge 
cards. Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the 
chronological membership register. Provide a <name card> for each 
new member. Outline plans for the entire service. _2)_ Arrange a 
reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together. 
Sponsors may sit with them also. _3)_ Invite sponsors or Fellowship 
Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service. 

_4)_ Give each new member a certificate of membership. _5)_ 
Introduce each new member to the congregation, asking him to face 
the congregation. _6)_ Lead the congregation in a response of 
welcome. _7)_ Have a reception for new members in the parlor or 
social hall immediately after the service. _8)_ Take a picture of 
the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the 
bulletin board. _9)_ Have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with 
new members as guests. 

#CHAPTER 6 PLANNING FOR THE ASSIMILATION AND 
GROWTH OF NEW MEMBERS#

THE CHURCH is "the family of God". 
The members of the "family" are drawn together by a common love 
for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom. Every member 
of the family must have a vital place in its life. This is no spectator-type 
experience; everyone is to be a participant.   Yet the 
most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right 
at this point- helping new members to become participating, growing 
parts of the fellowship. Very easily they may be neglected and eventually 
join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.   A study 
of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period 
revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who 
joined the Church were <lost to the Church within seven years>. One 
denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the 
period under study, and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991- 
a net growth of only 122,158. Yet during the same period there 
were 1,080,062 additions. Another major church body had 4,499,608 
members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444. During 
this time 4,122,354 new members were brought into the fellowship. 
Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago. During 
this period 7,484,268 members were received, yet the net membership 
now is only 9,910,741. These figures indicate that we are losing 
almost as many as we are receiving into membership.   This problem 
is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the 
active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship. 
Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where population 
is expanding, show that numbers of churches have had little net 
increase, though many new members were received. Something is wrong when 
these things happen. The local "family of God" has failed its 
new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare. 

#BASIC NEEDS#

NEW MEMBERS <can> become participating, growing 
members. But this will not happen merely through the natural process 
of social life. It must be planned and carefully developed. The 
entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part 
in this dynamic process.   If the church has followed the plan 
of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership 
preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process of assimilation 
and growth will be well under way. Those who enter the <front 
door> of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will 
not so easily step through the <back door> because of lost interest.

However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment
