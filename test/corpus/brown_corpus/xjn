University as an instructor in the English Department. But 
he had delayed accepting this job, and as he was leaving to come home 
to Papa in response to our telegram, he dropped a postcard to Miss 
McCrady, head of the Harvard Appointment Office, asking her please 
to write Northwestern authorities and explain the circumstances.

Actually Tom had been postponing giving them an answer, I'm 
confident, because he did not want to go out there to teach. In fact, 
he didn't want to teach anywhere. He wanted to go back to Harvard 
for another year of playwriting. But Papa's death had further complicated 
the financing of Tom's hoped-for third year, and for the 
weeks following it Tom did not know whether his return to Harvard could 
be arranged.   But things were worked out in the family and 
late in August he wrote Miss McCrady an explanatory letter in which 
he told her that matters at home had been in an unsettled condition 
after Papa's death and he had not known whether he would stay at home 
with Mama, accept the Northwestern job, or return to Harvard. But 
he was happy to tell her that his finances were now in such condition 
that he could go back to Harvard for a third year with Professor 
Baker.   And that's what he did. That third year he wrote plays 
with a fury. I believe there are seventeen short plays by Tom now 
housed in the Houghton Library at Harvard; I think I'm right 
in that figure. That fall he submitted to Professor Baker the first 
acts and outlines of the following acts of several plays, six of them, 
according to some of his associates, and he also worked on a play 
that he first called <Niggertown>, the material for which he had collected 
during the summer at home. Later this play would be called <Welcome 
to Our City>. In the spring, it must have been, he began 
working on the play that he called <The House>, which later would 
be <Mannerhouse>. That spring <Welcome to Our City> was selected 
for production by the 47 Workshop and it was staged in the middle 
of May. It ran two nights, and though it was generally praised, there 
was considerable criticism of its length. It ran until past one o'clock. 
That was Tom's weakness; it was demonstrated, many critics 
would later point out, in the length of his novels. In this play 
there were so many characters and so much detail. Tom never knew how 
to condense, to boil down. He was always concerned with life, and he 
tried to picture it whole; he wanted nothing compressed, tight. He 
was a big man, and he wanted nothing little, squeezed; he despised parsimony, 
and particularly of words. In this play there were some thirty 
or more named characters and I don't know how many more unnamed. 
In describing it to Professor Baker after it had been chosen for 
production, he defended his great array of characters by declaring that 
he had included that many not because "I didn't know how to save 
paint", but because the play required them. And he threatened someday 
to write a play "with fifty, eighty, a hundred people- a whole 
town, a whole race, a whole epoch". He said he would do it, though 
probably nobody would produce it, for his own "soul's ease and 
comfort".   That summer Tom attended the summer session at Harvard, 
but he did not ask Mama to send him back in the fall. Instead, 
he went down to New York and submitted <Welcome to Our City> 
to the Theatre Guild, which had asked him to let them have a look at 
it after Professor Baker had recommended it highly. He hung around 
New York, waiting to hear whether they would accept it for production 
and in that time came down to Asheville and also paid a short visit 
to Chapel Hill, where with almost childish delight he visited old 
friends and favorite campus spots. On returning to New York he had 
a job for several weeks; it was visiting University of North Carolina 
alumni in New York to ask them for contributions to the Graham 
Memorial Building fund. The Graham Memorial would be the campus 
student union honoring the late and much beloved Edward Kidder Graham, 
who had been president when Tom entered the university.   Well, 
the Theatre Guild kept that play, and kept it, and finally in 
December they turned it down. But they would reconsider it, they assured 
him, if he would rewrite it. Tom told me about it, how one evening 
he went over to see the Theatre Guild man. This man, Tom said, 
had the play shut up in his desk, I believe, and when Tom sat down, 
he pulled it out and apologetically told Tom that they wouldn't be 
able to use it.   Tom said he almost burst into tears, he was so 
disappointed and put out. The man, Tom said, explained that it was 
not only too long and detailed but that as it stood it wasn't the sort 
of thing the public wanted. The public, Tom said the man told him, 
wanted realism, and his play wasn't that. It was fantastic writing, 
beautiful writing, the man declared, but the public, he insisted, 
wanted realism.   Tom was not willing to revise the play according 
to the plan the man suggested. Such a revision, he said, would ruin 
it, would change his whole conception of the play as well as the treatment. 
He thought about it and he told the man he just couldn't do 
it over in accordance with the suggestions he had made.

It was not until we had returned to the city to live, while I 
was still at Brown and Sharpe's, that I felt the full impact of 
evangelical Christianity. I came under the spell of a younger group 
in the church led by the pastor's older son. The spirit of this group 
was that we were- and are- living in a world doomed to eternal 
punishment, but that God through Jesus Christ has provided a way of 
escape for those who confess their sins and accept salvation. 
There are millions who accept this doctrine, but few indeed are those 
who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lies as a weight on 
their souls night and day. This group in Park Place Church was made 
up of the earnest few. I was drawn deeper and deeper into these concerns 
and responsibilities. I engaged more and more in religious activities. 
Besides Church and Sunday School I went to out-of-door meetings 
on the sidewalk at the church door. I went to an afternoon service 
at the ~YMCA. I went to the Christian Endeavor Society 
and to the evening service of the church. Much of this lacked the active 
support of the pastor. The young people were self-energizing, and 
I was energized. Once or twice my father asked me if I wasn't overdoing 
a bit in my churchgoing.   Meanwhile I myself was not yet 
saved. At least I had been unable to lay hold on the experience of 
conversion. Try as I might to confess my sins and accept salvation, 
no answer came to me from heaven. Finally, after years, I gave up.

The basic difficulty, I suppose, was in my ultimate inability 
to feel a burden of sin from which I sought relief. I was familiar 
with <Pilgrim's Progress>, which I read as literature. No load 
of sin had been laid on my shoulders, nor did earnest effort enable 
me to become conscious of one.   There is, of course, the doctrine 
of original sin, which asserts that each of us as individuals partakes 
of the guilt of our first ancestor. In the rhyming catechism this 
doctrine is worded thus: "In Adam's fall We sin-ned all".

This doctrine was repugnant to my moral sense. I did not feel 
it presumptuous to expect that the Creator would be at least as just 
as the most righteous of His creatures; and the doctrine of original 
sin is compounded of injustice.   Some of these thoughts- not 
all of them- have taken organized form in later years. The actual 
impelling force which severed me from evangelical effort was of another 
sort. I became disgusted at being so preoccupied with the state of 
my own miserable soul. I found myself becoming one of that group of 
people who, in Carlyle's words, "are forever gazing into their own 
navels, anxiously asking 'Am I right, am I wrong'"? I bethought 
me of the Lord's Prayer, and these words came to mind: 
"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven". 
They have remained on the opened page of my mind in all the years 
which since have passed. From that time to this my religious concern 
is that I might give effective help to the bringing in of God's kingdom 
on earth.   I do not claim to be free from sin, or from the 
need for repentance and forgiveness. In my experience the assurance 
of forgiveness comes only when I have confessed to the wronged one and 
have made as full reparation as I can devise. ##

There was one 
further step in my religious progress. This was taken after I came 
to live in Springfield, and it was made under the guidance of the Reverend 
Raymond Beardslee, a young preacher who came to the Congregational 
Church there at about the same time that I moved from New York. 
His father was a professor at Hartford Theological Seminary, 
and from him he acquired a conviction, which he passed along to me, that 
there is in the universe of persons a moral law, the law of love, 
which is a natural law in the same sense as is the physical law.

It is most important that we recognize the law of love as being unbreakable 
in all personal relationships, whether individually, socially 
or as between whole nations of people. If obeyed, the law brings order 
and satisfaction. If disobeyed, the result is turmoil and chaos.

As we observe moral law and physical law they appear as being inevitable. 
We can conceive of no alternatives. Their basis seems deeper 
than mere authority. They are not true because scientists or prophets 
say they are true. It is not the authority of God Himself which 
makes them true. Because God is what He is, the laws of the universe, 
material and spiritual, are what they are. Deity and Law are one 
and inseparable.   With this conviction, the partition between 
the sacred and the secular disappears. One's daily work becomes sacred, 
since it is performed in the field of influence of the moral law, 
dealing as it does with people as well as with matter and energy.

In his book <Civilization and Ethics> Albert Schweitzer faces 
the moral problems which arise when moral law is recognized in business 
life, for example. His <Ethics> defines "possessions as the 
property of the community, of which the individual is sovereign steward. 
One serves society by conducting a business from which a certain 
number of employees draw their means of subsistence; another by giving 
away his property in order to help his fellow man. Each will decide 
on his own course somewhere between these two extreme cases according 
to the sense of responsibility which is determined for him by the particular 
circumstances of his own life. No one is to judge others".

He is uncompromising in assigning guilt to the man who finds 
it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for 
the sake of a larger good. For this decision a man must take personal 
responsibility. Says he, "I may never imagine that in the struggle 
between personal and supra-personal responsibility it is possible 
to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape 
of a relative ethic; or to let the ethical be superseded by the purposive. 
On the contrary it is my duty to make my own decision as between 
the two".   Schweitzer seems, in fact, to acquire for himself 
a burden of sin, not bequeathed by Adam, but accumulated in the 
inevitable judgments which life requires of him as between greater and 
lesser responsibilities. This viewpoint I find interesting, but it 
has never weighed on my soul. Perhaps it should have. My own experience 
has followed simpler lines.   An uncompromising belief in the 
moral law has the advantage of making religion natural, even as physical 
law is natural. Neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feels 
any self-consciousness in obeying the laws of matter and energy, 
nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience. To 
obey the moral law is just ordinary common sense, applied to a neglected 
field. Religion thus becomes integrated with life.   This 
truth that the moral law is natural has other important corollaries. One 
of them is that it gives meaning and purpose to life. In seeking 
for such meaning and purpose, Albert Schweitzer seized upon the concept 
of the "sacredness of life". It is puzzling to the occidental 
mind (to mine at least) to assign "sacredness" to animal, insect, 
and plant life. These lives are in themselves outside of the moral order 
and are unburdened with moral responsibility. There is indeed a 
moral responsibility on man himself, for his own soul's sake, to respect 
lower life and to avoid the infliction of suffering, but this viewpoint 
Schweitzer rejects.   So far as "sacredness" inheres
