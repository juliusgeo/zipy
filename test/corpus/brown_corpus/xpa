his sketching them while they went about their work, but no one could 
be persuaded to come to his studio to pose. He was told to ask for 
Rabbi Melzi at the synagogue on Saturday afternoon. Michelangelo found 
the rabbi in the room of study, a gentle old man with a white beard 
and luminous grey eyes, robed in black gabardine with a skullcap on 
his head. He was reading from the Talmud with a group of men from his 
congregation. When Michelangelo explained why he had come, Rabbi 
Melzi replied gravely:   "The Bible forbids us to bow down 
to or to make graven images. That is why our creative people give their 
time to literature, not to painting or sculpture".   "But, 
Rabbi Melzi, you don't object to others creating works of art"?

"Not at all. Each religion has its own tenets".

"I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara marble. I wish to make 
Jesus an authentic Jew. I cannot accomplish this if you will not 
help me".   The rabbi said thoughtfully, "I would not want 
my people to get in trouble with the Church".   "I am working 
for the Cardinal of San Dionigi. I'm sure he would approve".

"What kind of models would you prefer"?   "Workmen. 
In their mid-thirties. Not bulky laborers, but sinewy men. With 
intelligence. And sensitivity".   Rabbi Melzi smiled at 
him with infinitely old but merry eyes.   "Leave me your address. 
I will send you the best the quarter has to offer". Michelangelo 
hurried to Sangallo's solitary bachelor room with his sketches, 
asked the architect to design a stand which would simulate the 
seated Madonna. Sangallo studied the drawings and improvised a trestle 
couch. Michelangelo bought some scrap lumber. Together he and Argiento 
built the stand, covering it with blankets.   His first 
model arrived at dusk. He hesitated for a moment when Michelangelo asked 
him to disrobe, so Michelangelo gave him a piece of toweling to 
wrap around his loins, led him to the kitchen to take off his clothes. 
He then draped him over the rough stand, explained that he was supposed 
to be recently dead, and was being held on his mother's lap. The 
model quite plainly thought Michelangelo crazy; only the instructions 
from his rabbi kept him from bolting. But at the end of the sitting, 
when Michelangelo showed him the quick, free drawings, with the 
mother roughed in, holding her son, the model grasped what Michelangelo 
was after, and promised to speak to his friends **h. He worked for 
two hours a day with each model sent by the rabbi.   Mary presented 
quite a different problem. Though this sculpture must take place 
thirty-three 
years after her moment of decision, he could not conceive 
of her as a woman in her mid-fifties, old, wrinkled, broken in body and 
face by labor or worry. His image of the Virgin had always been that 
of a young woman, even as had his memory of his mother.   Jacopo 
Galli introduced him into several Roman homes. Here he sketched, 
sitting in their flowing gowns of linen and silk, young girls not yet 
twenty, some about to be married, some married a year or two. Since 
the Santo Spirito hospital had taken only men, he had had no experience 
in the study of female anatomy; but he had sketched the women of 
Tuscany in their fields and homes. He was able to discern the body 
lines of the Roman women under their robes.   He spent concentrated 
weeks putting his two figures together: a Mary who would be young 
and sensitive, yet strong enough to hold her son on her lap; and 
a Jesus who, though lean, was strong even in death **h a look he remembered 
well from his experience in the dead room of Santo Spirito. 
He drew toward the composite design from his meticulously accurate memory, 
without need to consult his sketches.   Soon he was ready 
to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay. Here he would have free 
expression because the material could be moved to distort forms. When 
he wanted to emphasize, or get greater intensity, he added or subtracted 
clay. Next he turned to wax because there was a similarity of 
wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence. He respected each 
of these approach techniques, and kept them in character: his quill 
drawings had a scratchiness, suggesting skin texture; the clay he used 
plastically to suggest soft moving flesh, as in an abdomen, in a reclining 
torso; the wax he smoothed over to give the body surface an 
elastic pull. Yet he never allowed these models to become fixed in his 
mind; they remained rough starting points. When carving he was charged 
with spontaneous energy; too careful or detailed studies in clay 
and wax would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model.

The true surge had to be inside the marble itself. Drawing and 
models were his thinking. Carving was action.

The arrangement 
with Argiento was working well, except that sometimes Michelangelo 
could not figure who was master and who apprentice. Argiento had 
been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits that Michelangelo was unable 
to change his habits: up before dawn to scrub the floors, whether 
they were dirty or not; water boiling on the fire for washing laundry 
every day, the pots scoured with river sand after each meal.

"Argiento, this is senseless", he complained, not liking to work 
on the wet floors, particularly in cold weather. "You're too clean. 
Scrub the studio once a week. That's enough".   "No", 
said Argiento stolidly. "Every day. Before dawn. I was taught".

"And God help anyone who tries to unteach you"! 
grumbled Michelangelo; yet he knew that he had nothing to grumble 
about, for Argiento made few demands on him. The boy was becoming acquainted 
with the <contadini> families that brought produce into Rome. 
On Sundays he would walk miles into the <campagna> to visit with 
them, and in particular to see their horses. The one thing he missed 
from his farm in the Po Valley was the animals; frequently he would 
take his leave of Michelangelo by announcing:   "Today 
I go see the horses".   It took a piece of bad luck to show 
Michelangelo that the boy was devoted to him. He was crouched over his 
anvil in the courtyard getting his chisels into trim, when a splinter 
of steel flew into his eye and imbedded itself in his pupil. He stumbled 
into the house, eyes burning like fire. Argiento made him lie 
down on the bed, brought a pan of hot water, dipped some clean white linen 
cloth and applied it to extract the splinter. Though the pain was 
considerable Michelangelo was not too concerned. He assumed he could 
blink the splinter out. But it would not come. Argiento never left 
his side, keeping the water boiled, applying hot compresses throughout 
the night.   By the second day Michelangelo began to worry; 
and by the second night he was in a state of panic: he could see nothing 
out of the afflicted eye. At dawn Argiento went to Jacopo Galli. 
Galli arrived with his family surgeon, Maestro Lippi. The surgeon 
carried a cage of live pigeons. He told Argiento to take a bird 
out of the cage, cut a large vein under its wing, let the blood gush 
into Michelangelo's injured eye.   The surgeon came back at 
dusk, cut the vein of a second pigeon, again washed out the eye.

Beth was very still and her breath came in small jerking gasps. 
The thin legs twitched convulsively once, then Kate felt the little 
body stiffening in her arms and heard one strangled sound. The scant 
flesh grew cool beneath her frantic hands. The child was gone.

When Juanita awoke, Kate was still rocking the dead child, still 
crooning in disbelief, "No, no, oh, <no!>"   They put 
Kate to bed and wired Jonathan and sent for the young Presbyterian 
minister. He sat beside Kate's bed with the others throughout the 
morning, talking, talking of God's will, while Kate lay staring angrily 
at him. When he told her God had called the child to Him, she 
rejected his words rebelliously.   Few of the neighbors came, but 
Mrs& Tussle came, called by tragedy. "It always comes in 
threes", she sighed heavily. "Trouble never comes but in threes".

They held the funeral the next morning from the crossroads 
church and buried the little box in the quiet family plot. Kate moved 
through all the preparations and services in a state of bewilderment. 
She would not accept the death of such a little child. "God called 
her to Him", the minister had said. God would not <do> that, 
Kate thought stubbornly.   Jonathan's letter came, as she knew 
it would, and he had accepted their child's death as another judgment 
from God against both Kate and himself. In blind panic of grief 
she accepted Jonathan's dictum, and believed in her desperation that 
she had been cursed by God. She held Jonathan's letter, his words 
burning like a brand, and knew suddenly that the bonds between them 
were severed. She had nothing left but her duty to his land and his 
son. Joel came and sat mutely with her, sharing her pain and anguish, 
averting his eyes from the ice packs on her bosom.   Juanita and 
Mrs& Tussle kept Kate in bed a week until her milk dried. When 
she returned to life in the big house she felt shriveled of all emotion 
save dedication to duty. She disciplined herself daily to do what 
must be done. She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita upstairs 
in the nurse's room off the empty nursery, although the girl tried 
to insist on moving back to the quarters to spare Kate remembrance of 
the baby's death.   Juanita drooped about the place, wearing 
a haunted, brooding look, which Kate attributed to the baby's death, 
until the day a letter came for her addressed to "Miss Juanita Fitzroy", 
bearing a Grafton postmark. Seeing the slanting hand, Kate 
knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel. The Federal 
forces had taken Parkersburg and Grafton from the Rebels and were moving 
to take all the mountains. Kate tried to contain her curiosity 
and foreboding at what the letter portended, at what involvement existed 
for Juanita.   Uncle Randolph and Joel had replanted the bottom 
lands with difficulty, for more of the slaves, including Annie, 
had sneaked off when the soldiers broke camp. Joel worked like a field 
hand in the afternoons after school. He had been at lessons in the 
schoolhouse since they returned from Harpers Ferry. Kate felt she 
had deserted the boy in her own loss. She loved him and missed his company.

Uncle Randolph had been riding out every evening on some 
secret business of his own. What it was Kate could not fathom. He 
claimed to be visiting the waterfront saloon at the crossroads to play 
cards and drink with his cronies, but Kate had not smelled brandy 
on him since Mrs& Lattimer's funeral. Joel knew what he was about, 
however.   "You're gonna get caught", she heard Joel 
say to Uncle Randolph by the pump one morning.   "Not this old 
fox", chuckled Uncle Randolph. "Everybody knows I'm just 
a harmless, deaf old man who takes to drink. I aim to keep a little whisky 
still back in the ridge for my pleasure".   "Whisky still, 
my foot", said Joel. "You're back there riding with the 
guerrillas, the Moccasin Rangers".   "Hush", said Uncle 
Randolph, smiling, "or I'll give you another black eye". He 
patted the eye Joel had had blackened in a fight over being Rebel at 
the crossroads some days back.   Kate had no idea what they were 
talking of, although she had seen the blue lights and strange fires 
burning and winking on the ridges at night, had heard horsemen on the 
River Road and hill trails through the nights till dawn. Stranger, 
Uncle Randolph began riding home nights with a jug strapped to his saddle, 
drunkenly singing "Old Dan Tucker" at the top of his voice. 
Hearing his voice ring raucously up from the road, Kate would await 
him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house, cold 
sober. What he was about became clear to her with the circulation of 
another broadside proclamation by General McClellan, threatening 
reprisals against Rebel guerrillas. She was taken up in worry for the 
reckless old man.   Kate drew more and more on her affection for 
Joel through the hot days of summer work. She had taken him out of 
the schoolhouse and closed the school for the summer, after she saw 
Miss Snow crack Joel across the face with a ruler for letting a snake 
loose in the schoolroom. Kate had walked past the school on her morning 
chores and had seen the whole incident, had seen Joel's burning
