of seconds Mickey lost sight of the blade. He felt it rip at the side 
of his jacket and a momentary sting under his left ribs. He got a 
knee up into Roberts' belly, used both hands and heaved him clear, 
then scrambled to his feet. They were in the center of the lobby now. 
Still clutching the razor, Roberts came up into a crouch, shaking 
his head. When he charged Mickey was ready. He hit Roberts with his 
left fist in the ribs and the razor cut toward him feebly, then wobbled 
in mid-air. With his right fist, and nearly all his weight behind 
it, he smashed at the bloodstained face.   Roberts careened backward, 
his back arched, fought for balance and, failing, stumbled against 
the newel post at the foot of the stairs. The sound of his head striking 
the solid wood was an ultimate, sudden-end sound. He fell on 
his side across the lowest step, rolled over once, then lay still.

Mickey found himself leaning against the desk, with stiff hands, 
panting for breath. After a minute he went to Roberts, looked at one 
of his eyes and felt for a pulse. He couldn't feel any. Roberts appeared 
to be dead; if not yet, then soon, very soon. Suddenly it was 
cold in the lobby. #@ 12#

It seemed to him that a long time 
had passed before he decided what to do. Actually it was no more than 
eight or ten minutes, and the sum of his reasoning came to this:

There's no way to take him in now and keep those other two- 
Wister and the one who hired the two of them- from finding out about 
Roberts and lamming out. The local law here would hold me till they 
check clear back home, and maybe more than that. They would have to. 
By then they could never catch up with the others. There's no other 
way; I'll have to do it myself.   He looked at where Roberts 
lay sprawled on the step. Mickey was sure now he was dead.

One thing, he thought, nobody knows about it yet. Only me.

He climbed the stairs, went into Roberts' room, found a suitcase 
and 
packed as much into it as he could. He left a few things. It didn't 
have to be perfect. Roberts was a wastrel. Walking away on impulse, 
he might logically leave behind what it was inconvenient to carry.

When he had closed the suitcase he found a rag and moved about 
the room, wiping carefully everything he might have touched. It took 
him nearly an hour. He went to the room he had rented and got into 
his overcoat. He left the rest of his things and returned to the lobby. 
He set Roberts' suitcase near the front door, went outside and 
walked back to the garage. He was mildly surprised to find it was snowing. 
It snowed softly, silently, an undulating interruption of his vision 
against the night sky. He could feel it on his face and in his 
hair.   He found the key to the Jeep, got it started and warmed 
it up for five minutes. Then he backed out and swung around to the front 
drive. He went into the hotel and searched till he found the razor. 
He put it in his own pocket for safekeeping. He took the suitcase 
out to the Jeep and put it in the front seat. Then he went back for 
Roberts.   The body was heavier than he had anticipated. He 
got it onto his shoulder after some work and carried it outside and down 
to the Jeep. He dumped it into the back and made sure it wouldn't 
roll out, then returned to the porch and closed the front door, making 
sure it was unlocked.   He drove carefully in the direction 
of the brief tour they had taken earlier. It snowed continuously, but 
quietly, evenly. When he reached the dip in the woods, he saw that 
already the earlier ruts were barely discernible. The Jeep fought its 
way through the low spot and got onto higher ground. He drove in low 
gear to the fork in the road and swung as close as possible to the entrance 
to the abandoned mine. He parked facing it and left the headlights 
on, but when he started into the tunnel with the suitcase, he found 
the illumination extended no farther than half a dozen feet into the 
passage. He went back and got the flashlight, returned to the tunnel 
and carried the suitcase to the edge of the pit he had found earlier. 
He tossed the bag into the pit and watched dry dust spray up around 
it. When the dust settled, he went back to the Jeep and carefully 
worked Roberts' body onto his shoulder.   It wasn't like carrying 
the suitcase. The soft snow was deceitful underfoot. Twice he 
nearly fell. Inside the passage, he had to work his way over the fallen 
timber and nearly collapsed under his clumsy burden. By the time 
he reached the edge of the pit he was panting and his shoulder and back 
ached under the drag of the dead weight.   He stood looking down 
for a few seconds, then backed up two or three paces from the edge. 
There was too much weight casually to toss it away. He could feel 
himself falling in with it and being unable to get out. It would be 
a bad place to die. It was a bad place for Roberts to wind up, but 
Roberts had asked for it. It was too late to worry about that.

He knelt slowly and dumped the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel. 
It was a relief to get rid of the weight. He was shaking with tension 
and it took him a couple of minutes to get his breath and settle down. 
Then he got on his knees and rolled Roberts' body toward the edge. 
It hung momentarily on the point of dropping off. He gave it a 
strong push, heard it slide, then tumble dryly into the hole. He got 
to his feet and threw the flashlight beam into the pit. The body lay 
in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen feet below the level of the tunnel 
floor.   Deep enough, he decided. There was little chance 
anyone would enter this shaft during the winter. The external signs of 
his approach to it would be covered by the snow, probably by the next 
day. It wasn't cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact. 
By spring it would be a skeleton.   He made his way back to 
the Jeep. He had started to back into the turn when he remembered 
the razor in his pocket. He climbed down, went back into the tunnel and 
tossed the razor into the pit. It landed on Roberts' sprawled right 
thigh, poised precariously, then slid off to the ground. He went 
back once more to the Jeep and started the short drive to the hotel.

In the garage he checked the Jeep for signs of the use he had 
made of it. There were stains here and there and he cleaned them off, 
using an oiled rag he found on a nail. He wiped the steering wheel 
and all the places he might have touched the Jeep. He replaced the 
flashlight where it had been stowed, got into his own car and backed it 
out of the garage. There were tire marks where it had been, but they 
were overlapped by others and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable 
except under close scrutiny. Liz Peabody, he thought, might spend 
some time grieving for her lost lover, but he doubted that she would 
launch an investigation. He judged her to be a woman of some pride, 
though not much sense. Still she would probably have sense enough not 
to call in the local sheriff to find her boy friend who, apparently, 
had run away.

He put in a call to Cunningham from his hotel room. The maid 
answered and he decided Nancy must be at work.   Jeb cautioned 
him not to be too hopeful and then, ignoring his own advice, said excitedly, 
"But it does sound good. A woman named Lisa who tells nobody 
anything about herself. That courtyard picture with the same initials".

"I'm not exactly jumping up and down with enthusiasm. 
I'll call you in a day or so".   On the highway he relaxed 
and enjoyed the drive over Lake Pontchartrain and along the coast.

Gulf Springs was ten miles inland- more of a quaint old 
coast town than those along the beach made garish by tourist attractions.

He checked into a motel and drove downtown. The courthouse 
was a white-stucco building minus the customary dome. Instead of the 
usual straggling privet hedges and patches of bare dirt in most small-town 
squares, the building was hemmed in by a semitropical growth of 
camellias and azaleas and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green 
shade of florist's grass.   He figured his best bet was a call 
on the sheriff. A clerk in the outer office took him in to Sheriff 
Carruthers, a big, paunchy man with thick, white hair and a voice with 
a senatorial resonance which suggested he should be running for higher 
office.   Seated in front of the desk, Hank said, "I'm 
looking for some information with very little to go on, Sheriff".

He explained the background of the case, ending with the tenuous 
clue which had brought him to Gulf Springs.   The sheriff's 
swivel chair tilted back. "So you're looking for a woman who married 
a man who might have lived here a year ago and might have been poisoned. 
If there was such a person, I'm afraid she got away with 
it. Pity we don't know more about him. I think the best bet is to 
go through the society columns of last year and see if any of the grooms 
match with the obituaries a little later. It'll be a tedious job, 
but if you want to try it, the old newspaper files are in the basement 
here in the county supervisor's office".   "Maybe the society 
editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride".

"That's an idea. Mrs& Calhoun has been society editor here 
for twenty-five years. The editor says that marriages may be made in 
heaven, but weddings are made in Mrs& Calhoun's columns. She's 
the one who decides which wedding is to get the lead space in the Sunday 
paper and all that". He smiled. "Once, when the editor was 
just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation, Mrs& Calhoun 
and the mother of the bride went out to his house and fought it out 
beside his bed. She'd be sure to remember any bride who was vague about 
background. She'd have made a great scientist dedicated to tracking 
down heredity and environment. She'd also remember if the groom 
died later". He stood up. "I wish you good luck, but please don't 
dig up too tough a case for me this close to election. If you 
find out anything, come on back here and we'll get started on it".

Tracking down Mrs& Calhoun was like trying to catch up with 
Paul Revere between Lexington and Concord. It turned out that 
she also sold real estate, cosmetics, and hospital insurance. The wearying 
trek stretched into the afternoon- from newspaper plant to insurance 
office to her house and back to the newspaper, where he found 
her at five o'clock.   She was a large woman with a frizzled gray 
poodle cut and a pencil clamped like a bit between her teeth while 
she hunted and pecked on an old typewriter. It took a couple of minutes 
to run through her various 
businesses and get down to the one he wanted.

"Last year? Well, I do remember one. From Baton 
Rouge. Married a man named Vincent Black. I remember her because 
she didn't want her picture in the paper. First bride like that I've 
seen in twenty-five years".   "What reason did she give"?

"Said she had a breaking-out on her face- some sort 
of allergy- and none of her old pictures was good enough. I didn't 
see her till several days later at the wedding, and her face looked 
like it had never had a 
blemish on it. But, of course, you couldn't 
see too well through the veil".   "Was her name Lisa Carmody"?

"Now how in hell would I remember that"?

"Never mind. I can look it up. Do they still live here"?

"I think they moved away shortly after they were married. He 
was a salesman for something or other and must have been transferred. 
I'm sure it'll be in the files. We usually run a social note when 
somebody moves away".   He stood up and thanked her.   "Have 
they inherited some money or something"? she asked with a 
reportorial gleam in her eye.   He said vaguely, "Well, it is 
a little legal matter, but nothing like that".   He hurried across
