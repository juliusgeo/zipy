of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs. 
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed 
a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed 
as aimed at the "very vitals of the Company's trade and power". 
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's 
local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding 
any more trade goods to these men.   With their customary source 
of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men 
to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country. Others carried 
pemmican from "the Forks" to St& Paul and goods from St& 
Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells, 
transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement. This 
trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, 
but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty 
was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.

The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow 
in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel. 
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor. Indeed, no richer 
humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in 
the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray. Some 
of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive. A Confederate 
observed that the Yankees were: "thicker than lise on a hen 
and a dam site ornraier". Another reported that his comrades were 
"in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house". 
A third wrote that it was "raining like poring peas on a rawhide".

Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression. One 
wrote: "[I am so hungry] I could eat a rider off his horse + 
snap at the stirups". A second reported that the dilapidated houses 
in Virginia "look like the latter end of original sin and hard times". 
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners: "They moved 
about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches 
on the neck of a wooden god". Still another, annoyed by the brevity 
of a recently received missive, wrote: "Yore letter was short and 
sweet, jist like a roasted maget". A Yankee sergeant gave the following 
description of his sweetheart: "My girl is none of your one-horse 
girls. She is a regular stub and twister, double geered. **h 
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from 
the muzzle to the crupper".   Humor found many modes of expression. 
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home: "What has become 
of Halda and Laura? **h When you see them again give them my 
love- not best respects now, but love by God". William R& Stillwell, 
an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved 
in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked 
to 
tease his wife in his letters. After he had been away from home about 
a year he wrote: "[Dear Wife] If I did not write and receive 
letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married 
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar 
as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as 
I am 
so forgitful". A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote: 
"I am growing so fat **h I am a burden 2 myself". Another 
Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer: "Now I lay me down 
to sleep, The gray-backs o'er my body creep; If they should bite 
before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break"". 
Charles 
Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his 
comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation, 
well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age. But he was very much like 
his associates in his hatred of camp routine. Near the end of his 
service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups, 
name one of them "fall-in" and the other "close-up", and 
then shoot them both, "and that will be the end of 'fall-in' and 
'close-up'".   The soldiers who comprised the rank and file 
of the Civil War armies were an earthy people. They talked and 
wrote much about the elemental functions of the body. One of the most 
common of camp maladies was diarrhoea. Men of more delicate sensibilities 
referred to this condition as "looseness of the bowels"; but 
a much more common designation was "the sh-ts". A Michigan soldier 
stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864: "I expect to be tough 
as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts". Johnny Rebs 
from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer 
to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering 
from the "the Virginia quickstep".   A Georgia soldier 
gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence 
of diarrhoea: "I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three 
days **h. I eat too much eggs and poark it sowered [on] my stomack 
and turn loose on me". A Michigan soldier wrote his brother: 
"I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear 
and I hope thease few lines find you the same".   The letters 
which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances. 
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers 
rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table. Most of 
the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of 
bark, drum heads, or the knee. In the South, after the first year of 
the war, paper and ink were very poor. Scarcity of paper caused many 
Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i&e&, after writing 
from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the 
sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously 
written. Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing 
about their heads. A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, 
stated "Not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced 
writing **h. I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we 
take no notice of them now". A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed 
his mother: "I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often 
**h for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter. Just 
count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every 
time". Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta 
reported: "The Yankees keep Shooting so I am afraid they 
will knock over my ink, so I will close". #/3,#

The most 
common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives. But 
fathers often addressed communications to their small children; and 
these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing 
of Civil War letters. Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include 
in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro 
community. Occasionally they would write to the slaves. Early in the 
war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro 
"body servants" to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging, 
cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes. 
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters 
of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members 
of their owners' families.   Unmarried soldiers carried on 
correspondence with sweethearts at home. Owing to the restrained usages 
characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were 
stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.   Occasionally 
gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about 
their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or 
Nashville. But these comments are hardly printable. An Alabama soldier 
whose 
feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully 
of his achievements among the Virginia belles: "They thout 
I was a saint. I told them some sweet lies and they believed it 
all **h I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five 
of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappies But I wold say I 
recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they 
would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk". 
Some of the letters were pungently expressive. An Ohio soldier who, 
from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment 
on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself 
thus: "[Dear Sis] Alf sed he heard that you and hardy was 
a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having 
any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse **h. 
I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf 
dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed card playing Sun 
of a bich com to Sea you, the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode 
helion, he is too orney for hel **h. i will Shute him as shore as 
i Sea him".   Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from 
soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions. 
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his 
first skirmish in Virginia: "Dear Pa **h. Went out a Skouting 
yesterday. We got to one house where there were five secessionist they 
brok + run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches 
and we all let go at them. Thay may say what they please but godamit 
Pa it is fun".   Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers 
in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers. A Mississippi 
soldier wrote: "Our General Reub Davis **h is a vain, 
stuck-up, illiterate ass". An Alabamian wrote: "Col& Henry 
is [an ignoramus] fit for nothing higher than the cultivation 
of corn". A Floridian stated that his officers were "not fit to 
tote guts to a bear". On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H& 
Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A&B& and M&A& degrees 
from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a 
private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife: "I saw Pemberton 
and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw **h. His head 
cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps 
**h. Jackson **h runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow 
their leader. He is not worth shucks. But he is a West Point 
graduate and therefore must be born to command".   Similar comments 
about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers. 
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War 
version of Bill Mauldin, wrote: "The officers consider themselves 
as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks 
**h. They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten 
cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals". Private George 
Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote: "I am well convinced in My 
own Mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended 
long ago". Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state: "I 
wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging 
them against [the other half]".   No group of officers 
came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors. One Federal 
soldier wrote: "The docters is no a conte **h hell will be filde 
with do[c]ters and offersey when this war is over". Shortly after 
the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank 
wrote his homefolk: "The surgeon insisted on Sending me to the hospital 
for treatment. I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed- 
thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than [by] Union 
quackery".   The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward 
each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut 
of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred. The Rebs were, to 
a Massachusetts corporal, "fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey 
+ gunpowder put into a human frame". A Pennsylvania soldier 
wrote that "they were the hardest looking set of men that Ever i saw 
they Looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings **h". 
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote 
in his diary: "I strolled among the Alabamans on the right 
**h found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe 
their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise 
with as imperfect a dialect 'They Recooned as how you'uns all would 
be a heap wus to we'uns all'". In a similar vein, but writing 
from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama 
Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated: "You know that 
my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid 
at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe By a set of 
cowardly Skunks whose Motto is Booty **h. 
THE POPULARITY OF FOLKLORE IN AMERICA STANDS IN DIRECT PROPORTION 
to the popularity of nationalism in America. And the emphasis on nationalism
