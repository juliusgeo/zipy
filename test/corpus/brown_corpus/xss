useless Wisconsin set-up, exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamrick's 
that nobody would buy, and the coincidental recent failure 
of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called Ticonderoga 
Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid 
to broach it. Initially, Hamrick's reaction to ~A-~Z going 
into the passenger car market was discouraging. He thought the financing, 
the advertising, the production of new models, the founding of 
a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult. Then he caught 
fire. If ~A-~Z could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use their 
presses and dies and other equipment, if William could hit precisely 
the right promotion note, if the money hurdle was not insurmountable 
**h.   They took nearly a month to investigate, marshal statistics, 
and put their arguments down in black and white. Taking Hamrick 
with him, William went to Mr& Willis. He was surprised and dubious, 
but impressed by the engineer and the report.   "Your alternative 
is breathtaking", he said, "and, I'm frank in saying, 
a bit mad. I wish I was younger and less timid **h. Well, I can't 
resolve this myself. I'll have to call in the brain trust. Are you 
willing to run the gantlet? I can't guarantee you a sympathetic 
audience".   "We'll be in there swinging", William said, 
"but in a way, sir, you've got to decide it yourself. You have 
the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours- 
and, besides, nobody else is going to have the courage. If they follow 
anyone, it'll have to be you". He paused. "I should explain: 
there's more here for me than advocating my little dream, there's 
you. You mustn't take a fall, or publicly back away. I hate that. 
You're- you're Arthur Willis **h. Forgive the hearts and 
flowers theme".   "I rather like the music", Willis replied 
quietly. "Thank you".   At the meeting, attended by Freddy, 
Richert, Herberet and the ~A-~Z executive staff, with 
Mr& Willis presiding, William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet. 
From shock and incredulity, most of the listeners went on to open 
resistance and animosity.   "Oh, my God", Ham Richert 
said, "a little child shall lead them. Move over, General Motors".

"It's absurd, Bill", Freddy said, from a pale face. 
"You're leading Dad down the garden path".   "Your 
garden, 
God damn it"! William said.   "I don't enjoy family 
quarrels", Adam said. "Nor crazy relatives. We're here to 
transact business. Can't we put an end to this, Arthur"?

"Hear me out, please", William begged. "I'm an advertising 
hustler, I admit, but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere. 
Sure, Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the Big 
Three. Their cars weren't small enough, they didn't have the 
power, they were old-fashioned. They tried to sell 'em on economy and 
simple merit. We've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery. 
We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age. 
Look what those little European jobs are doing. We'll woo the 
consumer with a product, not bludgeon him with chromed excess length 
and weight. Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and 
a seduction, at reasonable rates. Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too 
soon, before the tide changed, still honest and stupid- and the network 
of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again- 
waiting for <us>, ready-made. We've got rid of the steam yachts 
and Georgian houses, and the bloated, too-expensive automobile is 
next. Why not come down smartly in the world, in a chic fashion, with 
an Allstates-Zenith"?   He swayed them somewhat, but the 
debate raged on. Financing emerged as the main obstacle. Mr& Willis 
made it evident that he had contributed his maximum.   "Nobody 
will underwrite it, I'm telling you", Freddy said. "I know 
what I'm talking about in that department".   "There's 
plenty of risk money", Ham Richert added, "but not for anything 
this risky".   "All right", William said. "We'll 
try to swing the deal on that basis. If we can't raise the capital, 
we're through. Nothing has been lost. You're up against it anyhow. 
Why won't you give me a chance"?   A silence fell. 
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction. He smiled at William 
and slowly rubbed his hands together.   "I feel I must 
answer the question", he said, "since the onus later, if any, should 
fall on me- I don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside 
my family **h. I'm not giving you a chance, Bill, but availing 
myself of your generous offer of assistance. Good luck to you".

"All the in-laws have got to have their day", Adam said, and 
glared at William and Freddy in turn.   Sweat started out on 
William's forehead, whether from relief or disquietude he could not 
tell. Across the table, Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled 
thumb and forefinger. Nobody else showed pleasure. ##

Spike-haired, 
burly, red-faced, decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an Ivy 
League suit, Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers' club. 
"Hello, boss", he said, and grinned. "I suppose I can never 
expect to call you 'General' after that Washington episode".

"I'm afraid not". 
It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco! 
For it seems that Barco, fancying himself a ladies' man (and why not, 
after seven marriages?), had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles 
at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said: "With 
your beard, dear, you ought to be in movies"!   Mills 
secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge, rushed to 
the Hollywood police station to report the theft, and less than five 
minutes later, detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail 
of Cal Barco.   On their way, they stopped at every gas station 
along the main boulevards to question the attendants. Finally, at Ye 
Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue, they learned that 
their man, having paused to get oil for his car, had asked about the 
route to San Diego. They headed in that direction and, at San Juan 
Capistrano by-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old 
Spanish Mission Drive-in, eating a hot tamale. At the moment, Barco's 
back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in 
on his convertible which, in their quest for the stolen lap rug, they 
proceeded to search. The robe, however, was missing, for by that time 
Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale.   The detectives 
placed Barco under arrest and, without informing him of the 
nature of the charge, took him back to Hollywood for questioning.

Thus it was that Barco, apprehended for mere larceny, now began 
to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered. During 
the return trip, Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless 
phrases, such as: "They're under sand dunes **h They're better 
off, I tell you **h I saved their souls". The detective, commenting 
on Barco's behavior, felt that he merely belonged among the myriad 
citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged- that he was 
a more or less harmless "nut"!   However while in his cell 
awaiting trial for theft, Barco, in a fit of apprehension, made an 
attempt to take his own life. The attempt had failed because, when 
endeavoring to cut his wrists, this murderer of seven women had fainted 
at the sight of blood. The jail authorities- attaching no particular 
significance to the episode- offered Barco whisky to revive him; 
but the old fellow, a lifelong teetotaler, refused it, and no more 
was thought of the matter.   Then it was that District Attorney 
Welch entered the case. A man of vaulting ambition, with one eye 
on the mayorship of Los Angeles, nothing ever escaped him which might 
possibly lead to personal publicity.   It was reported to Welch's 
office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide. Welch 
wanted to know why. No one knew. Now Welch had a pet theory that 
everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at. 
The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory 
to the test. So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their 
chat by stating bluntly:   "Barco, we've got the goods 
on you! It'll be a lot better if you come clean".   At 
first Barco was evasive and shifty. But with Welch's relentless pursuit 
of the subject, Barco finally "broke" and started confessing 
to one murder after another. By the time Barco reached the count 
of three, the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true. But 
if true, it was the case of which he had dreamed, the case which would 
throw him into headlines all over America as the hero of a great 
murder trial.   Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell. 
But to Welch's chagrin, the police captain pooh-poohed Welch's 
credulity in Barco's confession. Barco was clearly a "nut". 
It required strength, bravado, daring to commit murder. "That worm 
a murderer? Ridiculous"! Then, for the first time since his 
arrest, a glint of spirit lit Barco's eyes. His manhood had been attacked. 
He stiffened and rose to his feet. He'd show them!

"Is that so"? he queried. "Well, for ten years I've been 
murdering women. I can lead you to every one of the bodies, and there 
ain't four, nor five, nor six of 'em- there's 
<seven!>"

The next day the police captain, in derision, organized what 
he termed "Welch's Wild Goose Chase". For indeed it seemed 
incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and 
not get caught at it, even in Hollywood. The searching party consisted 
of the police captain, Welch, Barco, policemen with shovels, newspaper 
reporters, and cameramen.   Barco, his state of apprehension 
gone, never to return, had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained 
his principal attitude from that time on. He directed the cortege 
of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica. Stopping the cars at 
a fork in the road, he got out, paced off a certain distance to a spot 
between two shrub-covered sand hills, and indicated a location.

Orders were given to dig. Nothing was found. Welch was worried. 
The police captain chortled. The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again 
Barco's pride was aroused. With greater precision he again paced 
off a location, this time a little more to the left.   With 
quibs and gibes, the policemen again started digging. Welch was on edge. 
The captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when 
finally one of the shovels struck an object.   "There's something 
here"! said the digger. Joking stopped and everyone gathered 
around. The digger, thrusting about with his shovel, now raised into 
view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's Hollywood 
sport shirts. Although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains, 
it was enough. Welch was wild with delight. His elation grew 
as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another.

Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour, and everything 
that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph 
for 
him. It went to his head, and his ambition increased.   It was 
apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power 
as D&A& to drag every possible sensation into the case. Every 
new scandal which would provide more "copy" for Marshall's 
pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch.   I knew that both 
these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when 
Viola was called to the stand. Once there, the D&A& with devilish 
cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines: "Viola's 
Multiple Romances"**h "Viola Lake an Addict"**h "Downfall 
of Another Film Idol"! It would be fine publicity for the 
man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken 
reputation of a helpless girl!   I studied Welch closely as 
the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how 
he might be thwarted. It wasn't long before I sensed that there was 
something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for 
Viola's destruction. He was bitter and resentful toward her, <personally> 
resentful. A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps
