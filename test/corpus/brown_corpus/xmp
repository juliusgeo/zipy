involve reading except Arithmetic Computation. Scores are stated 
in grade-equivalents on a national norm. The battery median grade-equivalent 
was used in data analysis in this study.   The Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children was administered to each sample 
third-grade child by a clinical worker. The relationship of intelligence 
test scores to school achievement is a well-established fact (in this 
case, **f); therefore, in the investigation of the present hypothesis, 
it was necessary to control this factor.   The criterion score 
used in the statistical analysis is an index of over- or under-achievement. 
It is the discrepancy between the actual attained achievement 
test score and the score that would be predicted by the I&Q&. 
For example, on the basis of the regression equation, a child with 
an I&Q& of 120 in this sample would be expected to earn an achievement 
test score of 4.8 (grade equivalent). If a child with an I&Q& 
of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement, his discrepancy score would be 
+.7, representing .7 of one year of over-achievement. A child with an 
I&Q& of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement test score 
of 3.5. If such a child scored 3.0, his discrepancy score would be -.5, 
representing .5 of one year of under-achievement. In this manner, 
the factors measured by the intelligence test were controlled, allowing 
discovered differences in achievement to be interpreted as resulting 
from other variables. 

#RESULTS#

_TEST OF INTERACTION OF COMPULSIVITY 
AND TEACHING METHODS_ Tables 1 and 2 present the results of 
the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity is used as the 
descriptive variable. Figure 1 portrays the mean achievement scores of 
each sub-group graphically. First of all, as we had surmised, the highly 
compulsive children in the structured setting score significantly 
better (**f) on achievement than do similar children in the unstructured 
schools. It can be seen too that when we contrast levels of compulsivity 
within the structured schools, the high compulsive children do 
better (**f). No significant difference was found in achievement between 
high and low compulsive children within the unstructured school. The 
hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching 
method was supported, in this case, at the .05 level.   While 
we had expected that compulsive children in the unstructured school 
setting would have difficulty when compared to those in the structured, 
we were surprised to find that the achievement of the high compulsives 
within the schools where the whole-word method is used in beginning 
reading compares favorably with that of the low compulsives. Indeed 
their achievement scores were somewhat better on an absolute basis 
although the difference was not significant. We speculate that compulsives 
in the unstructured schools are under greater strain because of 
the lack of systemization in their school setting, but that their need 
to organize (for comfort) is so intense that they struggle to induce 
the phonic rules and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the 
environment.   It is interesting to note that medium compulsives 
in the unstructured schools made the lowest achievement scores (although 
not significantly lower). Possibly their compulsivity was not strong 
enough to cause them to build their own structure.   Our conjecture 
is, then, that regardless of the manner in which school lessons 
are taught, the compulsive child accentuates those elements of each 
lesson that aid him in systematizing his work. When helped by a high 
degree of structure in lesson presentation, then, and only then, does 
such a child attain unusual success. _TEST OF INTERACTION OF ANXIETY 
AND TEACHING METHODS_ The statistical analyses of achievement in 
relation to anxiety and teaching methods and the interactions of the 
two are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Figure 2 is a graph of the mean 
achievement scores of each group. As predicted, the highly anxious children 
in the unstructured schools score more poorly (**f) than those 
in 
the structured schools. The interaction effect, which is significant 
at the .01 level, can be seen best in the contrast of mean scores. While 
high anxiety children achieve significantly less well (**f) in the 
unstructured school than do low anxiety children, they appear to do at 
least as well as the average in the structured classroom.   The 
most striking aspect of the interaction demonstrated is the marked decrement 
in performance suffered by the highly anxious children in unstructured 
schools. According to the theory proposed, this is a consequence 
of the severe condition of perceived threat that persists unabated 
for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment. The 
fact that such threat is potent in the beginning reading lessons is 
thought to be a vital factor in the continued pattern of failure or 
under-achievement 
these children exhibit. The child with high anxiety may 
first direct his anxiety-released energy toward achievement, but because 
his distress severely reduces the abilities of discrimination and 
memorization of complex symbols, the child may fail in his initial attempts 
to master the problem. Failure confirms the threat, and the intensity 
of anxiety is increased as the required learning becomes more 
difficult, so that by the time the child reaches the third grade the 
decrement in performance is pronounced.   The individual with high 
anxiety in the structured classroom may approach the learning task 
with the same increased energy and lowered powers of discrimination. But 
the symbols he is asked to learn are simple. As shown earlier, the 
highly anxious individual may be superior in his memorizing of simple 
elements. Success reduces the prospect of threat and his powers of 
discrimination are improved. By the time the child first attacks the 
actual problem of reading, he is completely familiar and at ease with 
all of the elements of words. Apparently academic challenge in the structured 
setting creates an optimum of stress so that the child with high 
anxiety is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state 
without becoming confused or panicked.   Sarason <et al>& 
present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like 
situation, and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives 
supporting and accepting treatment from the teacher. Although the 
present study was not a direct replication of their investigations, the 
results do not confirm their conclusion. Observers, in the two school 
systems studied here, judged the teachers in the structured schools 
to be more impersonal and demanding, while the atmosphere in the 
unstructured schools was judged to be more supporting and accepting. 
Yet the highly anxious child suffered a tremendous disadvantage only 
in the unstructured school, and performed as well or better than average 
in the structured setting. 
_ANALYSIS_ Analysis means the evaluation of subparts, the comparative 
ratings of parts, the comprehension of the meaning of isolated elements. 
Analysis in roleplaying is usually done for the purpose of understanding 
strong and weak points of an individual or as a process to 
eliminate weak parts and strengthen good parts. _IMPERSONAL PURPOSES_ 
Up to this point stress has been placed on roleplaying in terms 
of individuals. Roleplaying can be done for quite a different purpose: 
to evaluate procedures, regardless of individuals. For example: 
a sales presentation can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying. 
_EXAMPLES_ Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones 
we have assembled by giving illustrations of roleplaying used for evaluation 
and analysis. One should keep in mind that many of the exciting 
possiblities of roleplaying are largely unexplored and have not been 
used in industry to the extent that they have been in military and other 
areas. _EVALUATION_ The president of a small firm selling restaurant 
products, had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen 
for his business. Interviewing, checking references, training the 
salesmen, having them go with more experienced salesmen was expensive- 
and the rate of attrition due to resignations or unsatisfactory 
performance was too high. It was his experience that only one good salesman 
was found out of every seven hired- and only one was hired out 
of every seven interviewed.   Roleplaying was offered as a solution- 
and the procedure worked as follows: all candidates were invited 
to a hotel conference room, where the president explained the difficulty 
he had, and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people who 
just did not work out. In place of asking salesmen to fill questionnaires, 
checking their references, interviewing them, asking them to 
be tried out, he told them he would prefer to test them. Each person 
was to enter the testing room, carrying a suitcase of samples. Each salesman 
was to read a sheet containing a description of the product. In 
the testing room he was to make, successively, three presentations 
to three different people.   In the testing room, three of the veteran 
salesmen served as antagonists. One handled the salesman in a 
friendly manner, another in a rough manner, and the third in a hesitating 
manner. Each was told to purchase material if he felt like it. The 
antagonists came in, one at a time, and did not see or hear the other 
presentations. After each presentation, the antagonist wrote his judgment 
of the salesmen; and so did the observers consisting of the 
president, three of his salesmen and a psychologist.   Ten salesmen 
were tested in the morning and ten more in the afternoon. This procedure 
was repeated one day a month for four months. The batting average 
of one success out of seven increased to one out of three. The president 
of the firm, calculating expenses alone, felt his costs had dropped 
one-half while success in selection had improved over one hundred 
per cent.   The reason for the value of this procedure was simply 
that the applicants were tested "at work" in different situations 
by the judgment of a number of experts who could see how the salesmen 
conducted themselves with different, but typical restaurant owners 
and managers. They were, in a sense, "tried out" in realistic situations.

From the point of view of the applicants, less time 
was wasted in being evaluated- and they got a meal out of it as well 
as some insights into their performances.   Another use of roleplaying 
for evaluation illustrates how this procedure can be used in 
real life situations without special equipment or special assistants during 
the daily course of work.   The position of receptionist was 
opened in a large office and an announcement was made to the other 
girls already working that they could apply for this job which had higher 
prestige and slightly higher salary than typing and clerking positions. 
All applicants were generally familiar with the work of the receptionist. 
At the end of work one day, the personnel man took the applicants 
one at a time, asked them to sit behind the receptionist's desk 
and he then played the role of a number of people who might come to 
the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes. 
Each girl was independently "tested" by the personnel man, and 
he served not only as the director, but as the antagonist and the observer.

Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl, whom 
he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat 
mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time, did 
the most outstanding job of playing the role of receptionist, showing 
wit, sparkle, and aplomb. She was hired and was found to be entirely 
satisfactory when she played the role eight hours a day. _ANALYSIS_ 
In considering roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area, 
since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision 
but rather with the examination and evaluation of many elements seen 
in dynamic functioning. Some cases in evidence of the use of roleplaying 
for analysis may help explain the procedure.   An engineer 
had been made the works manager of a firm, supplanting a retired employee 
who had been considered outstandingly successful. The engineer had 
more than seven years of experience in the firm, was well trained, was 
considered a hard worker, was respected by his fellow engineers for 
his technical competence and was regarded as a "comer". However, 
he turned out to be a complete failure in his new position. He seemed 
to antagonize everyone. Turnover rates of personnel went up, production 
dropped, and morale was visibly reduced. Despite the fact that he 
was regarded as an outstanding engineer, he seemed to be a very poor 
administrator, although no one quite knew what was wrong with him. At 
the insistence of his own supervisor- the president of the firm, he 
enrolled in a course designed to develop leaders.   He played 
a number of typical situations before observers, other supervisors who 
kept notes and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought 
was wrong. Entirely concerned with efficiency, he was merciless in
