
#HARVEY BARCUS, SECOND SPEAKER#

The 
second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of the Dog Writers 
Ass'n of America.   Mr& Barcus spoke on the subject of 
scholarships for Juniors- with which he is very familiar. Last year 
a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing 
Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000. He gave a resume of 
the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.

"Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and 
should be earnestly encouraged"! is one of Mr& Barcus' strong 
beliefs. He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should 
take a MORE ACTIVE part in encouraging the Junior Division!

In closing, Mr& Barcus also wished all the Juniors 
luck in their Class. 

#WESTMINSTER SHOW NOTES#

Instead of 3 a&m& 
in the past, the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 
p&m&. This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the 
show- a great advantage to them!   Before the Juniors entered 
the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved 
their dogs around the ring and set them up, they could relax with their 
dogs. From there on, each Junior was going to be judged individually. 
This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the 
Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour, 
45 minutes to judge the Class. 

#ANNE HONE ROGERS JUDGES 28TH FINALS# 

This year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged the 
Class. This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at 
Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.   As the 
Juniors entered the ring, Mr& Spring, the announcer, stated over 
the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster 
has held the Finals of the Junior Competition. Juniors competed 
last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club recognized 
shows to be eligible to compete in this Class- the Finals 
for the year. A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class 
was eligible.   (The purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition 
is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen. Many 
adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class.)

It seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 
4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered. A large number of these Juniors 
have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.

After the judge moved all the dogs individually, she selected 
several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring. She 
then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship. 

#INTERNATIONAL CHAMPION OF THE YEAR#

BETTY LOU HAM, 
age 
16, Holyoke, Mass&, showing an Irish Setter, was chosen as International 
Champion of the year. She was awarded the Professional Handlers' 
Ass'ns' LEONARD BRUMBY, SR& Memorial Trophy 
(named for the FOUNDER-ORIGINATOR of the Junior Classes.)

Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit 
last year. In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year, 
she also scored with an Afghan. 

#OTHER WINNERS#

SYDNEY LE 
BLANC, age 15, Staten Island, N&Y&, showing a Doberman Pinscher, 
was 2nd.   SUSAN HACKMANN, age 14, from Baltimore, 
Md&, showing a Dachshund, was 3rd. Last year Susan also placed 
3rd in the Finals at Westminster. From the records we keep- 
Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in 
both United States and Canada.   KAREN MARCMANN, age 16, 
Trapp, Penna&, showing a Keeshond was 4th.   Most Juniors 
who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only 
show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as 
well. 

#ENTRIES INCREASING- REQUIREMENTS RAISED#

In 1960, there 
were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes. Each year these shows have 
increased in entries. Next year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show 
Committee has raised the requirements so that a JUNIOR MUST WIN 
3 OR MORE JUNIOR CLASSES IN THE OPEN DIVISION ONLY TO QUALIFY FOR WESTMINSTER.

PERCY ROBERTS, a leading judge will not be 
at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest 
as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March. 

#JUDGING 
CLASS FOR INTERMEDIATES PROPOSED#

It has been suggested many times 
that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter 
the Junior Classes. For some time this writer has been suggesting 
a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years 
of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class.

Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester ~KC 
Show recently. Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class, 
but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day. The Intermediates 
in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners 
and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice 
of the Judge.   We suggested this Class in the horse world and 
it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows 
At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated 
that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success 
and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world. 
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given 
a chance. Last year Robert Harris, a leading Junior Handler entered 
the Dog Judging Contest (Junior) at the International ~KC 
of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior 
since the Class' inception. Juniors who attend this Chicago show 
should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help 
to them. 

#MORE VOLUNTEER HANDLERS NEEDED TO JUDGE#

Superintendents 
at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed 
Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition. The founder of 
the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr& 
(for whom the trophy is named after at Westminster) was an outstanding 
Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit 
in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.

Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew 
nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog. To 
overcome this unfair judging, the A&K&C& requires that a licensed 
Handler be present to judge the Class. If the superintendents 
do not receive more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested 
that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class. By recognizing 
and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world, all will 
be helping to create future dog owners. 

#OTHER AWARDS FOR JUNIORS# 

The Airedale 
Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier 
Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to 
the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition 
at any Show. The Kansas City and the Topeka ~KCs 
are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to 
win points for Westminster. The Rio Grande ~KC is also considering 
having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify 
with points for Westminster.   The American Pointer Club 
is still continuing to donate a trophies to Juniors who win at Junior 
Showmanship Classes with Pointers.

Traveling through the South- over 16,000 miles- with two 
Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten, we've worked up a 
regular routine for acceptance at motels.   My husband enters the 
motel office, signs up for a room, and them solemnly asks the proprieter 
if he accepts pets. "Puppies"? comes the suspicious question. 
"No", he replies, "full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken, 
and obedience-trained".   We've never been refused!

Once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way 
spot, keep them under control in the room, and feed and bench them where 
they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.

In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin!

Many a motel owner- when we've stopped there again- has remembered 
us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.

So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the 
table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination. 
Is it that they don't care? Are they indifferent to the 
fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?

AT ONE TIME, to most Americans, unless they were fortunate 
enough to live near a body of navigable water, boats were considered 
the sole concern of fishermen, rich people, and the United States 
Navy.   Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening 
statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport. There 
are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States 
with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade. 
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960. Boating has 
become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining 
sea. Boats are operated in every state in the Union, with the heaviest 
concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West.

The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident, 
expectedly, in the areas where boats have always been found: the natural 
lakes, rivers, and along the nation's coastline. But during the 
last several years boats were launched in areas where, a short time 
ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for 
livestock.   Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources 
control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies of water represent 
a kind of glorious fringe benefit, providing boating and fishing 
havens all over the country.   No matter how determined or wealthy 
boating lovers of the Southwest had been, for example, they could 
never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake 
Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which resulted when the
