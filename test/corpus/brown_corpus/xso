he spent at home, talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments 
of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things 
in which he alone was interested.   "Do you still have <The 
Book of the Dead"?> she asked him and, laughing, she added, "I 
was nervous about buying a book with a title like that, but I knew 
you'd like it".   "Yes", he lied to shorten the conversation, 
"I still have it". He was no longer able to relax in the 
presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation 
with his mother or father, no matter the subject. As for <The 
Book of the Dead>, it along with his other books on religion had been 
incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which 
he had lived in New York. He had dusted each of the books carefully 
and carried them all to the basement and, trembling at having to open 
the big furnace, given them up to the flames. Then he sped from the 
dark basement and returned to his room and cried.   Richard left 
America with his clothes, his biwa and his image of Acala and, on the 
freighter which took him to Japan, he plucked at the biwa, trying 
to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had 
once heard. During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody 
out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain 
at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure. 
He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty 
North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water. It was so dark 
that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean 
kept him from hearing it. It was as though the biwa had been eaten 
up 
by the wind.   In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to 
that which he had lived in New York, except that he had replaced his 
biwa with a friend. An American student named Charlotte Adams had 
refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at 
last succeeded in getting him to talk to her. He had nothing much to 
say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied 
her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo. In Charlotte, 
Richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which, 
after a fashion, he envied. In time, he grew to depend upon her occasional 
company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate 
in more social activity. She convinced him that he ought to be a member 
of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms 
and in the end he complied with her wishes, although it was only rarely 
that he added anything to the random conversations.   At one such 
gathering Charlotte announced, "I was at Ryusenji today. Have 
you ever been to Ryusenji"? No one had. "Well, it's at Fudomae 
and there was a tan young man, quite naked, taking a shower in 
the pool. I was thoroughly startled".   Richard thought it a 
more promising remark than any made during the last conversation, but 
Charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial 
than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would 
lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded 
it. Three of the four persons present, all foreign students in 
Tokyo, had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by 
the In and Out system, an equation in which Zen philosophy was used 
as the modifier. Soba, udon and tea were In because they could be 
taken noisily. Sushi was Out because it was pretentious. Sashimi was 
In, Samuel Burns had suggested, because it was too far Out to 
stay 
Out, even if it was a little pretentious. Richard had kept his eyes 
down throughout the game, the very sound of the chatter nearly painful 
to his ears.   "He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my 
watching him", said Charlotte.   "Did you watch him"? asked 
a red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter. "I shouldn't have been 
able to do that".   "Well I was able to do it", Charlotte 
said with no sign of irritation. "For a minute, anyhow. I'm 
surprised no one has been there. I've been there a number of times. 
Sam, I thought you knew everything about Tokyo. You've never 
been to Ryusenji"?   "I've heard about it", Samuel 
Burns said. "There's a little place there called Lovers Mound 
dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki".   "Yes, a little parkish 
place", Charlotte said, and concluded, "Anyhow, it's all 
very nice. And the man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried 
there, next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo. Oh, that's what 
I meant to tell you. This is the interesting part, Richard", 
she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking. "There 
was that fellow out there in the bitter cold"-   "My 
God, it <was> cold today", said Samuel Burns. "Twenty-two 
or twenty-three".   "And the water would be still colder", 
Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it.   "And your golden 
god", said Samuel Burns, "probably went right home and poured 
himself into a boiling bath. It would kill one of us".   "But 
the point is", Charlotte said, "there he was, freezing, naked 
in a little stream of water at Ryusenji, all in worship of Fudo, 
the god of fire".   Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for 
the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light. It was true; Fudo, 
the 
god of wisdom, was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala. 
The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening. He found 
himself trying to remember something, but he couldn't decide even the 
nature of what it was he worked to recall. He had almost given up 
when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of 
the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching. Perhaps 
he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter 
and the ascetic at Ryusenji, he was unable to put it together. 
That night, after leaving Charlotte's apartment, Richard walked 
about for a time before returning to his room. When he at last did go 
to his room, he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before 
his little image of Acala, thinking first of Charlotte's tale of 
the man at Ryusenji, then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters. 
And the next morning, not sure of why he went, he took the train 
to Fudomae and walked to Ryusenji.   He was surprised by the sharp 
sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte 
had mentioned. He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the 
water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots 
high at the back of the pool. On the hillside above was caged what might 
have been an incarnation of Fudo, or perhaps a demon. The strange 
creature, housed in wire, made him shudder. The sensation he so overwhelmingly 
realized was one which told him he had been there before 
but he knew he had not, and could not recall any place he had visited 
to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls 
or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach.   He left the pool 
and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple, and the sense of 
familiarity with the place would not leave him. Into a little well before 
the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge 
to sound the bell before the temple, to take hold of the rope and crash 
it against the circle of bronze; but the spirit he wished to call 
out would not, he knew, come in the person of the temple priest. Instead, 
he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of 
stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head. The black Fudo 
seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught 
by the Fudo's in fascination, and then Richard was shocked as, 
all at once, flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face 
and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound, as if the large statue 
were about to burst from some pressure within it. Then the flames 
were gone, the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard 
began to tremble violently. Suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his 
coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried 
back down both stairways and away from the temple, never looking 
back. He walked all the miles back to his room.   He seemed to 
have picked up a virus that day, because the next morning he had a small 
cough and felt a bit hot. He stayed home, reading and refusing to 
think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji. But the process 
of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he 
couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day. The 
cold lingered, making sleep difficult that night, and he remained 
in bed still the next morning, now unable to keep from thinking about 
the inexplicable sight of burning metal, the wretched sound, the unbearable 
feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier 
time in his life. All of the elements of the experience were impossible 
and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never 
again to visit the temple at Fudomae. 
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing 
the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings. It 
had grown hot early that day, and I hoped that the boy, my brother's 
son, would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground, 
carrying the jar of cool water. The boy usually was sent out at about 
that time with the water, and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath 
or a stick along, to play with. He pretended that the lath was a tractor 
and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing, tractor 
sounds with his lips.   I almost ran over the snake before I could 
stop the tractor in time. I had turned at the corner of the field 
and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into 
the earth, and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway, and 
when I looked again down the furrow, the snake was there. It lay half 
in the furrow and half out, and the front wheels had rolled nearly 
up to it when I put in the clutch. The tractor was heavily loaded with 
the weight of the plow turning the earth, and the tractor stopped 
instantly.   The snake slid slowly and with great care from the 
new ridge the plow had made, into the furrow and did not go any further. 
I had never liked snakes much, I still had that kind of quick panic 
that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one, but this snake was 
clean and bright and very beautiful. He was multi-colored and graceful 
and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only 
so slightly. Go out of the furrow, snake, I said, but it did not move 
at all. I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out, hoping to 
frighten him with the noise, but the snake only flicked its black, forked 
tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel, without fright or concern.

I let the engine idle then, and I got down and went around 
the wheel and stood beside it. My movement did frighten the snake and 
it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped 
again, and its tongue was working very rapidly. I followed it, looking 
at the brilliant colors on its tubular back, the colors clear and 
sharp and perfect, in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of 
a baby's fist down its back, and the diamonds were set one within the 
other and interlaced with glistening jet-black. The colors were astonishing, 
clear and bright, and it was as if the body held a fire of 
its own, and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin, 
vivid and alive and warm. The eyes were clear and black and the slender 
body was arched slightly. His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted 
as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that 
solemn mouth.   You beauty, I said, I couldn't kill you. You 
are much too beautiful. I had killed snakes before, when I was younger, 
but there had been no animal like this one, and I knew it was 
unthinkable that an animal such as that should die. I picked him up, 
and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a 
little wildly, and I could feel the coolness of that radiant, fire-colored 
body, like splendid ice, and I knew that he had eaten only recently 
because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart 
of him, like fieldmice swallowed whole might make.   The body 
caressed through my hands like cool satin, and my hands, usually tanned 
and dark, were pale beside it, and I asked it where the fire colors 
could come from the coolness of that body. I lowered him so he would 
not fall and his body slid out onto the cool, newly-plowed earth, from 
between my pale hands. The snake worked away very slowly and delicately 
and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty, and he carried 
his head a little above the rolled clods. The sharp, burning colors of 
his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil, like a target.

I felt good and satisfied, looking at the snake. It shone 
in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the 
crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself. The 
color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien, too,
