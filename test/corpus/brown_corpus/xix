it was futile to argue with her young husband, yet the uncomfortable 
fact remained: the American Congregationalists were sending them as 
missionaries to the Far East and paying their salaries. What would 
happen if Adoniram "changed horses in midstream"? Baptists and 
Congregationalists in New England were on friendly terms. How embarrassing 
it would be if the newly appointed Congregationalist missionaries 
should suddenly switch their own beliefs in order to embrace Baptist 
teachings!   "If you become a Baptist, I will not", 
Ann informed her husband, but sweeping her threat aside Adoniram 
continued to search for an answer to the personal dilemma in which he 
found himself.   By early June they were a hundred miles off the 
coast of Ceylon, by which time all four missionaries were hardened 
seafarers. Even Harriet could boldly write, "I know not how it is; 
but I hear the thunder roll; see the lightning flash; and the 
waves threatening to swallow up the vessel; and yet remain unmoved".

Ann thrilled to the sight of a delicate butterfly and two 
strange tropical birds. Land was near, and on June 12, one hundred 
and fourteen days after leaving America, they actually saw, twenty miles 
away, the coast of Orissa.   Captain Heard gave orders for 
the ship to be anchored in the Bay of Bengal until he could obtain 
the services of a reputable pilot to steer her through the shallow waters.

Sometimes ships waited for days for such a man, but Captain 
Heard was lucky. Next day a ship arrived with an English pilot, 
his leadsman, an English youth, and the first Hindu the Judsons and 
Newells had ever seen. A little man with a "a dark copper color" 
skin, he was wearing "calico trousers and a white cotton short gown". 
Ann was plainly disappointed in his appearance. "He looks 
as feminine as you can imagine", she decided.   The pilot possessed 
excellent skill at his calling; all day long the <Caravan> 
slowly made her way through the difficult passages. Alas, to Ann's 
consternation, his language while thus employed left much to be desired. 
He swore so loudly at the top of his voice, that she didn't get 
any sleep all the next night.   Next morning the <Caravan> was 
out of the treacherous Bay. Relieved of the major part of his responsibility 
for the safety of the ship, the pilot's oaths became fewer. 
Slowly she moved up the Hooghli River, a mouth of the mighty Ganges, 
toward Calcutta.   Ann was entranced with the view, as 
were her husband and friends. Running across the deck, which was empty 
now that the livestock had been killed and eaten, they sniffed the spice-laden 
breezes that came from the shore, each pointing out new and 
exciting wonders to the other.   Out came the journal and in it 
went Ann's own description of the scene:   "On each side 
of the Hoogli, where we are now sailing, are the Hindoo cottages, as 
thick together as the houses in our seaports. They are very small, 
and in the form of haystacks, without either chimney or windows. They 
are situated in the midst of trees, which hang over them, and appear 
truly romantick. The grass and fields of rice are perfectly green, and 
herds of cattle are everywhere feeding on the banks of the river, and 
the natives are scattered about differently employed. Some are fishing, 
some driving the team, and many are sitting indolently on the banks 
of the river. The pagodas we have passed are much larger than the 
houses".   Harriet was just as delighted. Where were the hardships 
she had expected? She was certain now that it would be no harder 
to bear her child here in such pleasant surroundings than at home 
in the big white house in Haverhill. With childlike innocence she wrote 
of the Indians as "walking with fruit and umbrellas in their hands, 
with the tawny children around them **h. This is the most delightful 
<trial> I have ever had", she decided.   The Indians 
who came aboard ship to collect the mail also interested her greatly, 
even if she was suitably shocked, according to the customs of the society 
in which she had been reared, to find them "naked, except a piece 
of cotton cloth wrapped around their middle".   At last they 
saw Calcutta, largest city of Bengal and the <Caravan's> destination. 
Founded August 24, 1690 by Job Charnock of the East India 
Company, and commonly called "The City of Palaces", it seemed 
a vast and elegant place to Ann Hasseltine Judson. Solid brick 
buildings painted dazzling white, large domes and tall, picturesque palms 
stretched as far as the eye could see, while the wharves and harbor 
were filled with tall-masted sailing ships. The noise stunned her. 
Crowds flocked through the waterfront streets chattering loudly in their 
strange-sounding Bengali tongue.   Harriet's mouth watered 
with anticipation when after months of dreaming she sat down at last 
to her much-craved milk and fresh bread. Ann, pleased to see her friend 
happy, was intrigued by the new fruits a friend of Captain Heard 
had sent on board for their enjoyment. Cautiously she sampled her first 
pineapple and another fruit whose taste she likened to that of "a 
rich pear". Though she did not then know its name, this strange new 
fruit was a banana.

The first act of Adoniram and Samuel 
on reaching Calcutta was to report at the police station, a necessity 
when landing in East India Company territory. On the way they 
tried to discover all they could about Burma, and they were disturbed 
to find that Michael Symes's book had not presented an altogether 
true picture. He had failed to realize that the Burmese were not really 
treating him as the important visitor he considered himself. They 
were in fact quietly laughing at him, for their King wished to have 
nothing to do with the Western world. When Captain John Gibault 
of Salem had visited Burma in 1793 his ship, the <Astra>, had been 
promptly commandeered and taken by her captors up the Irrawaddy River. 
Although after much trouble he did manage to get it back, he discovered 
there was no trade to be had. All Captain Gibault took back 
to Salem were a few items for the town's East India Museum. A 
year later another Salem ship returned from Burma with a cargo of gum 
lacquer which nobody wanted to buy. After that Salem ships decided 
to bypass unfriendly Burma.   The Burmese appeared to have little 
knowledge of British power or any idea of trade. They despised 
foreigners. Cruel Burmese governors could, on the slightest whim, take 
a man's life. As for missionaries, even if they succeeded in getting 
into the country they probably would not be allowed to preach the 
Christian faith to the Burmans. Unspeakable tortures or even execution 
might well be their fate.   "Go back to America or any 
other place", well-meaning friends of Captain Heard advised them, 
"but put thoughts of going to Burma out of your heads".   Somewhat 
daunted, the two American missionaries reached the police station 
where they were questioned by a most unfriendly clerk. When he discovered 
they had received from the Company's Court of Directors 
no permission to live in India, coupled with the fact that they were 
Americans who had been sent to Asia to convert "the heathen", he 
became more belligerent than ever.   They explained that they 
desired only to stop in India until a ship traveling on to Burma could 
be found. 
She describes, first, the imaginary reaction of a foreigner puzzled by 
this "unseasonable exultation"; he is answered by a confused, 
honest Englishman. The reasons for the Whig joy on this occasion are 
found to be their expectation of regaining control of the government, 
their delight at the prospect of a new war, their hopes of having the 
Tories hanged, and so on. As for the author of the <Englishman,> 
Mrs& Manley sarcastically deplores that the sole defense of the 
Protestant cause should be left to "<Ridpath, Dick Steele,> and 
their Associates, with the Apostles of <Young Man's> Coffee-House".

Another controversy typical of the war between the 
<Englishman> and the <Examiner> centered on Robert (later Viscount) 
Molesworth, a Whig leader in Ireland and a member of the Irish 
Privy Council. On December 21, the day that the Irish House 
of Commons petitioned for removal of Sir Constantine Phipps, their 
Tory Lord Chancellor, Molesworth reportedly made this remark on the 
defense of Phipps by Convocation: "They that have turned the 
world upside down, are come hither also". Upon complaints from the 
Lower House of Convocation to the House of Lords, he was removed 
from the Privy Council, his remark having been represented as a blasphemous 
affront to the clergy. Steele, who had earlier praised Molesworth 
in <Tatler> No& 189, now defended him in <Englishman> 
No& 46, depicting his removal as a setback to the Constitution. On 
the other hand, Molesworth was naturally assailed in the Tory press. 
Swift, in the Dublin edition of <A Preface to the Bishop of Sarum's 
Introduction,> indicated his feelings by including Molesworth, 
along with Toland, Tindal, and Collins, in the group of those 
who, like Burnet, are engaged in attacking all Convocations of the clergy. 
In the same way he coupled Molesworth and Wharton in a letter 
to Archbishop King, and he had earlier described him as "the worst 
of them" in some "Observations" on the Irish Privy Council 
submitted to Oxford. A month later, in <The Publick Spirit of 
the Whigs,> he used Steele's defense of Molesworth as evidence of 
his disrespect for the clergy, calling Steele's position an affront 
to the "whole Convocation of <Ireland>". On this issue, then, 
as on so many in these months, Steele and Swift took rigidly opposed 
points of view.   In the early months of 1714, the battle 
between Swift and Steele over the issue of the Succession entered its 
major phase. The preliminaries ended with the publication of Steele's 
<Crisis> on January 19, and from that point on the fight proceeded 
at a rapid pace. In answer to <The Crisis,> Swift produced 
<The Publick Spirit of the Whigs,> his most extensive and bitter 
attack on his old friend. By this time, as we shall see, the Tories 
were already planning to "punish" Steele for his political writing 
by expelling him from the House of Commons. Despite his defense 
of himself in the final paper of the <Englishman> and in his speech 
before the House, their efforts were successful. Steele lost his 
seat in Parliament, and his personal quarrel with Swift, by now a public 
issue, thus reached its climax.   Of all the Whig tracts 
written in support of the Succession, <The Crisis> is perhaps the 
most significant. Certainly it is the most pretentious and elaborate. 
Hanoverian agents assisted in promoting circulation, said to have reached 
40,000, and if one may judge by the reaction of Swift and other 
government writers, the work must have had considerable impact. Steele's 
main business here is to arouse public opinion to the immediate 
danger of a Stuart Restoration. To this end, the first and longest 
section of the tract cites all the laws enacted since the Revolution 
to defend England against the "Arbitrary Power of a Popish Prince". 
In his comment on these laws Steele sounds all the usual notes 
of current Whig propaganda, ranging from a criticism of the Tory 
peace to an attack on the dismissal of Marlborough; but his principal 
theme is that the intrigues of the Tories, "our Popish or Jacobite 
Party", pose an immediate threat to Church and State. Like 
Burnet, he deplores the indifference of the people in the face of the 
crisis. Treasonable books striking at the Hanoverian Succession, 
he complains, are allowed to pass unnoticed. In this connection, Swift, 
too, is drawn in for attack: "The Author of the Conduct of 
the Allies has dared to drop Insinuations about altering the Succession". 
In his effort to stir the public from its lethargy, Steele 
goes so far as to list Catholic atrocities of the sort to be expected 
in the event of a Stuart Restoration, and, with rousing rhetoric, he 
asserts that the only preservation from these "Terrours" is to 
be 
found in the laws he has so tediously cited. "It is no time", he 
writes, "to talk with Hints and Innuendos, but openly and honestly 
to profess our Sentiments before our Enemies have compleated and put 
their Designs in Execution against us".   Steele apparently 
professed his sentiments in this book too openly and honestly for his 
own good, since the government was soon to use it as evidence against 
him in his trial before the House. In the final issues of the <Englishman,> 
which ended just as the new session of Parliament began, 
he provided his enemies with still more ammunition. For example, No& 
56 printed the patent giving the Electoral Prince the title of Duke 
of Cambridge. In a few months the Duke was to be the center of
