indeed it had no taste at all, not a grain of salt. She ate what she 
could and went out along the covered passageway, with the rain dripping 
from the vines. In the kitchen Glendora was despairingly picking 
chickens. "Get a basket", Sarah told her. "We'll go to the 
storehouse".   Glendora dropped a chicken and a flurry of feathers, 
and went with her through the drizzle, to the storehouse. Sarah 
found the right key and unlocked the door.   It was a long, 
low room, like a root cellar, for it was banked up with soil, and vines 
had run rampant over that, too. It was dark but dry and cool. She 
doled out what Glendora vaguely guessed were the right amounts of dried 
peas, eggs, cornmeal, a little salt. The shelves looked emptier than 
when Miss Celie had shown her the storeroom, and since the men from 
the Commissary had called; there were certainly now fewer mouths 
to feed but there was less to feed them with. She took Glendora to 
the smokehouse, unlocked it and saw with satisfaction there was still 
a quantity of hams and sides of bacon, hanging from the smoke-stained 
rafters.   They wouldn't go hungry, not yet. And the fields 
were green and growing. "Can't you possibly imagine what life is 
going to be like, here"? Maude had said.   Maude. 
She 
sent Glendora back to the house, her basket and her apron laden. She 
stood for a moment, rain dripping from the trees over her head, thinking 
of Maude.   Maude had the opportunity to take the bottle 
of opium from Sarah's room. Maude had the cool ruthlessness to d 
o 
whatever she made up her mind to do. She couldn't see how her death 
could affect Maude. She couldn't see any reason why Maude would 
attempt to frighten her. Besides, there was something hysterical and 
silly, something almost childish about an attempt to frighten her. Maude 
was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah rather doubted if she 
had ever 
been childish.   Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to 
New York. Maude could have shot Emile- if she'd had a reason 
to kill him.   There was no use in standing there in the drizzle, 
trying to find a link between Emile's murder and opium in a cup 
of coffee.   She started back for the house, saw a light in the 
office, opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was 
far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder. Rev, George 
and Lolotte were mending shoes.   a lighted lamp stood on the 
table that dusky, drizzling day. They were all three bent over a shabby 
riding boot; George had a tack hammer. Lolotte held a patch of 
leather, Rev steadied something, a tiny brad, waiting for George's 
poised hammer. George said, "First thing I do when I get to Vicksburg 
again, is get me a Yankee"-   "With boots on", 
Lolotte laughed softly.   Rev looked up and saw her. Lolotte 
looked up and stiffened. George didn't look up at all. There was 
no way to know, no way to guess whether any one of them was surprised 
at Sarah's appearance, believing her to be drugged and senseless- 
and just possibly dead.   Rev said, "Come in, Sarah. Reckon 
you know the news".   And what news, Sarah thought as satirically 
as Maude might have said it.   Rev's face was suddenly 
a little fixed and questioning. He turned to George and Lolotte. "Take 
your cobbler's shop somewhere else. I want to talk to Sarah".

Everything in the office, the spreading circle of lamplight, 
the patch of leather in Lolotte's hands. George poised with the 
tack hammer, the homely, everyday atmosphere, all denied an attempt 
at murder. A rush of panic caught Sarah. "No. Not now. I mean 
I've got to- to see to the kitchen. Glendora"-   Her words 
jumbled together and she all but ran from the office and from the 
question in Rev's face.   Now why did I do that? she thought 
as warm, drizzling rain touched her face. She was no schoolgirl, 
refusing to bear tales.   As she reached the kitchen door the answer 
presented itself; if she told anyone of the opium it must be Lucien, 
her husband.   It might be, indeed it had already proved 
to be a marriage without love, but it was marriage. So she couldn't 
choose Rev as a confidant; it must be Lucien.   Always provided 
that Lucien himself had not dosed her coffee with opium, she thought, 
as coldly and sharply, again, as Maude might have said it.

She paused at the kitchen door, caught her breath, told herself firmly 
that the opium was only an attempt to frighten her and went into 
the kitchen, where Glendora was eyeing the chickens dismally and Maude 
was cleaning lamp chimneys. Glendora gave a gulp. "Miss Sarah, 
I can't cut up no chicken. Miss Maude say she won't". 
Again the homely, everyday details of daily living refuted a vicious 
attempt to frighten her- or to murder her.   The homely everyday 
details of living and domestic requirements also pressed upon her 
with their immediate urgency. No matter what had happened or hadn't 
happened, 
somebody had to see about dinner. She eyed the chickens with, if she 
had known it, something of Glendora's dismal look and thought with 
a certain fury of the time she had spent on Latin verbs.

"Not since last night. I didn't think there was any reason 
to".   "Maybe there isn't. Speak to him again anyway. Try 
talking to some of the fellows he works with, friends, anyone. Try 
to find out how happy he is with his wife, whether he plays around with 
women. You might try looking into his wife too. She might have been 
talking to some of her friends about her husband if they've been 
having any trouble".   "You think Black's the one we're 
looking for"?   "Yeah. I think he might be", Conrad 
said grimly. "Then again he might not".   "What a stinking 
world", Rourke said. "Black is Gilborn's best friend".

"I know".   "Will you be coming back soon"?

"I think so. I'm on my way to see the Jacobs woman".

"Gilborn's secretary? What for? You don't think Gilborn 
is the-"?   "I don't think anything. I just don't 
want to go off half-cocked before picking up Black, that's all". 
Conrad interrupted. "Gilborn says he was in his office all day with 
her yesterday. I'd like to make sure. Also, it's just possible 
she might know something about Mrs& Gilborn".   "Right. 
I'll see you later".   "Aren't you ever going to go home"?

"It sure as hell doesn't look like it, does it? 
I'm telling you, if these corpses ever knew the trouble they put us 
to, they'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off".

"Remember to tell that to the next corpse you meet".

Conrad hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth bench, massaging 
his right leg.   He looked at his watch. It was ten minutes 
before eleven.   He wondered how long it would be before they 
had a signed confession from Lionel Black.   Thirty years' experience 
let him know, even at this early stage, that Black was his 
man.   But he still wanted to know why. ##

It was a cold, windy 
day, the day after Kitti's death, but Stanley Gilborn paid no 
attention to the blustery October wind.   After leaving Conrad, 
Gilborn had no destination. He simply walked, not noticing where 
he was, not caring. He stopped automatically at the street corners, 
waiting for the traffic lights to change, unheeding of other people, his 
coat open and flapping.   As he walked, he tried to think.

Of Kitti. Of himself. Mainly of what Conrad had tried to make 
him believe.   There was nothing coherent about his thinking. 
It was a succession of picture-images passing through his mind: the 
same ones, different ones, in no apparent sequence, in no logical succession.

The enormity of what Conrad had told him made it impossible 
for Gilborn to accept, with any degree of realism, the actuality 
of it.   Conrad's words had intellectual meaning for him only. 
Emotionally, they penetrated him not at all.   <Whoever he 
was and your wife were intimate>.   Gilborn remembered Conrad's 
exact words. They made sense and yet they didn't. He knew Conrad 
had told him the truth. It was so. Yet it wasn't so. It wasn't 
so because it couldn't be so.   When Kitti was alive- 
and he remembered the pressure of her hand resting lightly on his arm- 
she had been the center of his life.   She was the sun, he the 
closest planet orbiting around her, the rest of the world existing 
and visible yet removed.   For fifty-five years he had lived, progressing 
towards a no-goal, eating, working, breathing without plan, 
without reason.   Kitti had come along to justify everything. She 
was his goal, she was his reason. He had lived all his life waiting 
for her.   Not once, in the time that he had known her, had he 
ever considered the possibility, not once, not for one one-thousandth 
of a second, of her infidelity.   He could not consider it now. 
Not really. And so he walked, aimless again.   The walk ended, 
inevitably, right in front of his hotel building. The doorman began 
to nod his head automatically, then remembered who Gilborn was, what 
had happened to him the night before. He looked at Gilborn with undisguised 
curiosity.   Gilborn passed by him without seeing him.

He crossed the lobby and rode up in the elevator lost in his own 
thoughts.   In the apartment itself, all was still. The police 
were no longer there. There was no evidence that anything was different 
than it had been.   Except that Kitti wasn't there.

Without taking off his coat, he sat in the blue chair which still 
faced the closed bedroom door.   At last, sitting there, in the 
familiar surroundings, the truth began to sink in.   <Who?>

He felt no anger towards Kitti, no sense that she had betrayed 
him.   <Who?>   She was all he had, everything he had, 
everything he wanted. Someone had taken her away from him. 
<Who>?   Where there is a left-hand entry in the ledger, there 
is a right-hand one, he remembered from his school days.   Where 
there is a victim, there is a killer.   <Who>? 
<Whoever he was and your wife were intimate>.   He rose from 
the 
chair, took off his coat. Quickly, he went into the bedroom.

The bed still showed signs of where Kitti had lain. Gilborn stood 
there for a long time. He looked at the bed unblinkingly.   The 
bed was empty now. Kitti would lie in it no more. He would lie in 
it no more.   Gilborn wondered whether Kitti had lain in that 
same bed with **h <Who?>   For thirty minutes, Stanley Gilborn 
stood there.   At the end of the half-hour, racking his brains, 
thinking over and over again of Kitti, her friends, her past, he 
left the bedroom.   <Who?>   He could think of no answer.

Gilborn put on his coat again. Before leaving, he took one 
last, lingering look at the apartment.   He knew he would never 
see it again.   In the street, walking as quickly as he could, Stanley 
Gilborn was a lone figure. ##

On Blanche Jacobs, Kitti 
Gilborn's death had a quite different effect. For Blanche, Kitti's 
death was a source of guilty, but nonetheless soaring, happy hope.

In Blanche's defense, it must be said she was unaware of 
the newborn hope.   If anyone had asked her, she would have described 
herself only as nervous and worried. The figures on the worksheet 
paper in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it 
was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with 
the typewriter.   She wondered whether Stanley would call. She
