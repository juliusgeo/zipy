were inseparable, not because they were fond of each other, but because 
they wanted to keep an eye on each other, as they were keen rivals 
for social leadership. Grazie was mean: quietly mean, and bitterly, 
unfunnily sarcastic. She it was who had looked to see if I was 
wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive. Grazie had a small, 
slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast. 
She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration, appointments, paint, 
and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring; the pets 
were a couple of Siamese cats. Her uniform was of rich, raw silk, in 
a shade which matched her hair, skin, housepaint, and cats, and since 
she was so thin as to be almost shapeless, she rather resembled a frozen 
fish stick.   The husbands of these women and others I had 
met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were, to me at 
least, indistinguishable. I couldn't tell one from the other. Like 
Herbert, they were all in communications: radio, television, magazines, 
and advertising. One or two were writers of books; all were fellows 
of finite charm. Each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and 
the habit of saying "zounds"! in deference to country-squirehood. 
I never thought I'd live to hear people chuckle and say "zounds"! 
in real life. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. They 
were "sincere"- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent 
smile. These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently 
pressing one of his hands in both of theirs, while they gazed, misty-eyed 
with care, into the eyes of the person they were meeting. Could such 
unadulterated love, for a total stranger, be credited? They were 
always leaping to light cigarettes, open car doors, fill plates or glasses, 
and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that 
I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves "Sanitary Bake Shops".

"<O Pioneers!>" I thought, and wondered what 
kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban 
frontier; pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher 
conferences and who never called the school principal "Mister". 
I sighed, thinking that among other things, people here seemed 
to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85,000 
yearly; people who would give their teeth for a chance to get 
on "Person to Person"; people who thought it was nice to be important, 
but not important to be nice; who were more ingratiating than 
gracious, more personalities than persons. In my estimation, they 
were people who read Daphne du Maurier, and discussed Kafka; well, 
not <discussed> him exactly, but said, "Kafka"! reverently 
and raised their eyes, as if they were at a loss to describe how they 
felt about Kafka, which they were, because they had no opinions about 
Kafka, not having read Kafka. They were, I felt, people invariably 
trying to prove not who, but what they were, and trying to determine 
what, not who, others were.   Becoming aware that it was nearly 
lunchtime, I brought myself back to the tasks at hand. I made plans 
for the afternoon- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at 
once, making the beds, and then maybe painting the kitchen. Then, I 
remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the 
last week. "BANANAS"! Jennie had shouted each time. "They're 
not dessert! They're not even food. They're just something 
you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast". I dug around 
and found a mix, and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food 
cake with chocolate icing. (Sometimes I think you need only one 
rule for cooking: if you can't put garlic in it, put chocolate in 
it.)   The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence 
in itself of the dearth of taste thrills Mama had been providing. 
Then Jennie closed her eyes, stretched forth her arms, and said: 
"Take my hand, Louise; I'm a stranger in paradise".

Needless to say, I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion 
upon free enterprise. How dared they demand to "snoop" in private 
financial records, disbursements, confidential contracts and agreements? 
"It is as though", I said on the historic three-hour, coast-to-coast 
radio broadcast which I bought (following Father Coughlin 
and pre-empting the Eddie Cantor, Manhattan Merry-go-round and 
Major Bowes shows) "That Man in the White House, like some despot 
of yore, insisted on reading my diary, raiding my larder and ransacking 
my <lingerie!>" My impassioned plea for civil rights created 
a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider 
replacing the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis. But 
what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator 
who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great 
nation? The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian Communism descended 
on the Athens that was mighty Metronome, sacking and despoiling 
with their Bolshevistic battle cry of "Soak the rich'! After 
an unspeakable siege, lasting the better part of two months, it was 
announced that the studio "owed" the government a tax debt in excess 
of eight million dollars while I, who had always remained aloof from 
such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned 
and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless relict, 
was "stung" with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions 
as to "wipe out" all but a fraction of my poor, hard-come-by savings. 
I was also publicly reprimanded, dragged through the mud by the 
radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as 
<The New Republic, The New Yorker, Time> and the <Christian 
Science Monitor>.   It was then that I availed myself of the 
rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional. The 
litigation was costly and seemingly endless. I fought like a tigress 
but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court (1937), 
Mr& Roosevelt and his "henchmen" had done their "dirty work" 
all too well, even going so far as to attempt to "pack" the highest 
tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me. Presidential 
coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers, "toadies" 
and sycophants of the "bench" against me, but it had been so far-reaching 
as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing 
me! I was ready, like Portia, to present my own brief. But the 
Supreme Court wouldn't even <hear> my case! My plea was unanimously 
voted down and "thrown out". Again, my name was on all the 
front pages. I was, it seemed, <persona non grata> in every quarter, 
but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers 
and students of jurisprudence. As Charles Evans Hughes said, 
"Miss Poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by 
her logic as a litigant". Albert Einstein was quoted as saying: 
"The workings of the woman's mind amaze me". Henry Ford spoke 
of me as "utterly astounding". Heywood Broun wrote: "Belle 
Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula", and even 
F&D&R& had to concede that "if the rest of this nation showed 
the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine, America would rapidly 
resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh".   Not only were 
the court costs prohibitive, but I was subjected to crippling fines, 
in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid "debts" which the governmen 
claimed that Metronome and I owed- a severe financial blow. 
Nor, as Manny said, had the notoriety done my career "any good". 
My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges 
as "reactionary", "robber baroness", and even "traitor"! 
Traitor indeed! I point now with pride to the fact that, long ere 
the Committee on Un-American Activities, the Minute Women, the 
Economic Council and other such notable "watchdog" organizations 
were so much as heard of, I was Hollywood's leading bulwark against 
communism, fighting single-handedly "creeping socialism" against 
such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the ~NRA, 
~PWA, ~WPA, ~CCC and an army of more than twenty-two 
million mercenaries whom F&D&R& employed secretly, through 
the transparent ruse of regular "relief" checks.   Needless 
to say, my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period. Could 
it do otherwise? Even though I have always had a genius for 
"throwing myself" into every role and "playing it for all it's 
worth", no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune, 
her reputation, her livelihood, her home and her nation itself are 
all imperilled. Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to 
"Oscar" winning performances. I tried my hardest, with little help, 
may I say, from my husband and leading man, but somehow the outside 
pressures were too severe.   Having (through <my> unflagging 
effort and devotion) achieved stardom, a fortune and a world-renowned 
wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote, Letch 
proceeded to neglect them all. Never a "quick study", he now 
made no attempt to learn his "lines" and many a mile of film was 
wasted, many a scene- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow 
thespians- was taken thirty, forty, fifty times because Miss Poitrine's 
co-star and "helpmate" had never learned his part. Each 
time Letch "went up" in his "lines", <I> was the one to 
be patient, helpful and apologetic while <he> indulged in outbursts 
of temperament, profanity and abuse, blaming others, going into "sulks" 
and, on more occasions than I care to count, storming off the "set" 
for the rest of the day. As for his finances, I was never privileged 
to know exactly how much money Letch had "salted away". 
It was I who paid for our little home, the food, the liquor, the servants- 
even Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic 
Club. Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third 
anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw. (But that is another story.) 
As for his private monies, they were rapidly dissipated in drinking, 
gaming and carousing. More than once I was confronted by professional 
gamblers, "bookies", loan "sharks", gangsters, "thugs" 
and "finger men"- people of a class I did not even know existed- 
to repay my husband's staggering losses, "or else **h" I 
shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with 
such a sinister <milieu>. And at three different times during our 
turbulent marriage strange girls, with the commonest of accents, telephoned 
to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children! 
Having the deepest of maternal instincts, my heart fairly bled when 
I thought of the darling pink and white "bundles from heaven" I 
would have proudly given my husband. "Ah, you're too old", was 
invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested "starting 
a family". Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did 
not care for the company of my own precious daughter. I now felt it wiser 
to keep Baby-dear in school and- during the summers- at a camp 
run by the Society of Friends all year around. Her presence only 
made Letch more distant and irritable and, in the hurry of buying Chateau 
Belletch, I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear, 
so there was no place to put her, anyhow. (I sometimes feel that God, 
in His infinite wisdom, <wants> us to have these inexplicable little 
lapses of memory. It almost always works out for the best.)

Yet I adored this man, Letch Feeley, why, I cannot say. With 
faint 
heart and a brave smile, I endured his long absences from Chateau 
Belletch, his coldness, his indifference, his slights and his abuse. 
The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him- lovely 
dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed 
and postponed and postponed, only to be served dry and overcooked 
at a table where the host's chair was vacant; a "splash party" 
at the new pool, which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch 
away from public beaches, when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed 
underwater together for the better part of an hour; a lovely Epiphany 
party at Errol Flynn's, on which sacred occasion Letch stole 
away with an unknown "starlet", leaving me "high and dry" to 
get home as best I could. These are but a sampling of the insults I 
endured. As Mrs& Letch Feeley, was it any wonder that I, once 
<the> social arbiter of Filmdom, was excluded from the smart entertainments 
given by the Astaires, the Coopers, the Gables, the Colmans, 
the Rathbones, the Taylors, the Thalbergs and such devout, closely 
knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys? As Letch's 
antisocial conduct increased, our invitations decreased and my heart 
was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable "screenland" 
gathering.   Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten 
films together, each less successful, both artistically and commercially, 
than the one before it. Our last joint venture, <Sainted Lady>, 
a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini, and
