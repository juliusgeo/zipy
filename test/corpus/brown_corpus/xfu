and other similar services. A little investigation by telephone or reading 
the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these 
pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits. The investigation 
will be well worth your time.   All model cars are not 
available in all countries. Quite naturally, there is a greater availability 
of those models which are manufactured within a specific country. 
If you would like to start your tour in Italy, where the rental 
fees are actually the lowest in Europe, Fiats in all sizes are available, 
as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models. If you wish to budget 
closely on transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries, 
one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus 3@ 
a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station 
Wagon, seating six, at just 
$1.10 a day and 10-1/2@ a kilometer. If you will be using your car 
more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the daily rates 
drop quite sharply to 86@ a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal 
30@ a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon. With six in the 
group, the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily 
fee.   In the majority of countries, however, the rates range from 
$3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 
and $8.00 a day for the larger, luxury European models, with the rate 
per kilometer driven starting at 3@ and going up as high as 12@. 
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries, yet 
not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate 
or rate per kilometer driven. The variations are not too great. Rates 
for American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about $8.00 a day 
up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible, but the rate per 
kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models. 
Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest 
in Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite high in Ireland.

If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a 
month, it might be wise for you to lease a car. The actual over-all 
cost, for the first month, will perhaps not be too much lower than the 
rental charges for the same period of time, but you will receive a new 
car. You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner, 
which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized 
dealers throughout Europe. Further, there is no mileage charge 
or mileage limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only the flat 
monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since 
the car is registered and insured individually for your trip. There is 
a fairly wide selection of models of English, German and French manufacture 
from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7, Citroe^n 
2 ~CV, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca 
Beaulieu. Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a 
car in Europe, but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical 
and satisfactory. After the first month, rates are considerably 
less, averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger 
models.   There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent 
cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan. For one thing, the driver 
usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes 
pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road. Then, 
too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on 
the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed 
up with them. Still there is a way for those who want to see some 
of the back country of Europe by car. The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven 
car. It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.

Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 
a day, but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger 
Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800. The big 
spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven, being governed by 
the rate at which gasoline is consumed. Since most European cars average 
more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars, it naturally 
follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less, 
but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize 
this, provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger 
limousine.   The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars 
vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for 
the drive-yourself cars. However, whether you arrange to have a European 
or American model, if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity 
in relation to the number of people in your party, your transportation 
expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger. 
This will include your helpful, English-speaking chauffeur and a 
drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day. If you drive greater 
distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface and will 
never discover the enchantment, fascination and beauty which lured 
you in the first place to explore the hinterlands. Of course, if you 
want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac 
limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have a memorable 
tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is not recommended unless you own 
a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.

In American romance, almost nothing rates higher than what the 
movie men have called "meeting cute"- that is, boy-meets-girl 
seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct 
and acute boredom. Just about the most enthralling real-life example 
of meeting cute is the Charles MacArthur-Helen Hayes saga: 
reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts, but he said 
simultaneously, "I wish they were emeralds". Aside from the comico-romantico 
content here, a good linguist-anthropologist could readily 
pick up a few other facts, especially if he had a little more of the 
conversation to go on.   The way MacArthur said his line- if 
you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist- would 
probably have gone like this: **f Primary stresses on emeralds and 
wish; note pitch 3 (pretty high) on emeralds but with a slight degree 
of drawl, one degree of oversoftness **h. Conclusions: The people 
involved (and subsequent facts bear me out here) knew clearly the relative 
values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary and sentimental. 
And the drawling, oversoft voice of flirtation, though fairly overt, 
was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.   In 
other words, like automation machines designed to work in tandem, they 
shared the same programming, a mutual understanding not only of English 
words, but of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can 
change their meaning from black to white. At this point, unfortunately, 
romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture; but consider, 
if you can bear it, what might have happened if MacArthur, for 
some perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark to an Eskimo 
girl in Eskimo. To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just 
so much blubber. The point- quite simply- is this: words they 
might have had; but communication, no.   This basic principle, 
the first in a richly knotted bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr& Henry 
Lee Smith, Jr&, at the University of Buffalo, where he heads 
the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics. A 
brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an ingenious system of 
spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith 
began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls- a project 
considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about "a young 
rat named Arthur, who never could make up his mind". Later, he 
became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and 
the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute. 
It was there, in the course of trying to prepare new men for the "culture 
shock" they might encounter in remote overseas posts, that he 
first began to develop a system of charting the "norms of human communication".

To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always 
revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker- 
such things as geographical origin and/or history, socio-economic identity, 
education. It is only fairly recently, however, that linguists 
have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way 
that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure 
of human communication between two people. This, for obvious reasons, 
makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric 
interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been successfully used 
to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.

In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished 
colleague, George Trager (so austerely academic he sometimes 
fights his own evident charm), and a third man with the engaging name 
of Birdwhistell (Ray), agreed on some basic premises about the three-part 
process that makes communication: (1) words or language (2) paralanguage, 
a set of phenomena including laughing, weeping, voice breaks, 
and "tone" of voice, and (3) kinesics, the technical name for 
gestures, facial expressions, and body shifts- nodding or shaking the 
head, "talking" with one's hands, et cetera.   Smith's 
first workout with stresses, pitches, and junctures was based on mother, 
which spells, in our culture, a good deal more than bread alone. 
For example, if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there are 
certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother. 
The usual U&S& norm would be: **f Middle pitches, slight 
pause (juncture) before mother, slight rise at the end. The symbols 
of mother's status, here, are all usual for culture U&S&A&. 
Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style: **f Note the 
drop to pitch 1 (the lowest) on mother with no rise at the end of the 
sentence; this is a "fade" ending, and what you have here is a 
downtalking style of speech, expressing something less than conventional 
respect for mother. Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie 
goes with: **f In other words, the way the speaker relates to mother 
is clearly indicated. And while the meaning of the words is not in 
this instance altered, the quality of communication in both the second 
and third examples is definitely impaired. An accompanying record 
of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a 
throaty 
rasp. With this seven-word sentence- though the speaker undoubtedly 
thought he was dealing only with the subject of food- he was telling 
things about himself and, in the last two examples, revealing that 
he had departed from the customs of his culture.   The joint investigations 
of linguistics and psychiatry have established, in point 
of fact, that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words 
are involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling 
over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate 
to the rest of the world. Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic 
and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of 
interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions 
in new research and training. Some of the earliest recordings, 
made in the 1940's, demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately 
to anger and anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records 
of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which- if 
they were at all discernible in print- were picked up only by the most 
skilled and sensitive experts. In a general way, psychiatrists were 
able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt- 
that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic, that such 
things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not 
necessarily by words.   At a minimum, recording- usually on tape, 
which is now in wide professional use- brings the psychiatric interview 
alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored 
repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists. Newest 
to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have 
carried that minimum to a new level. By adding a systematic analysis 
with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews, they have supplied 
a new set of techniques for the therapist. Linguistic charting of 
the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs 
from expected norms. It flags such possible breakdowns of communication 
as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval, ambivalence 
or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and the disinclination to speak at 
all- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.

Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the therapist, but 
orientation- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical 
and socio-economic background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways
