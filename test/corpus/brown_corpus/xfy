are served at least once a day. Vegetables are served liberally. Most 
come from the root cellar or from the freezer. Home-made sauerkraut 
is served once a week. Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads 
and dishes such as chop suey. Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to 
bread and causes the children to remark, "Lillian, did you put nuts 
in the bread today"?   Milk appears twice a day. The school 
raises enough poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs. 
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served. Hens are kept 
on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility.

Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue and heart are 
planned once a week. Also, salt water fish is on the table once a week.

For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once a week. 
Most other desserts are fruit in some form, fresh fruits once daily 
at least, sometimes at snack time. Dried fruits are purchased from sources 
where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed. Apples come 
from 
a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed. Oranges and grapefruit 
are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm.   Finding 
sources for these high quality foods is a problem. Sometimes the 
solution comes in unexpected ways. Following a talk by Mr& Clark 
at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man 
from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school 
from Vermont.   Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are 
used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat loaves. Miss 
Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available 
at the tables. Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table 
for the children to help themselves.   Very few fried foods are 
used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged. Drinking with meals 
is also discouraged; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables.

Nothing is peeled. The source is known so there is no necessity 
to remove insecticide residues. The cooking conserves a maximum 
of the vitamin ~C content of vegetables by methods which use very 
little water and cook in the shortest time possible. 

#WHOLESOME SNACKS, 
NO CANDY#

Since Mr& Clark believes firmly that the chewing 
of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw vegetables and 
raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat 
cookies at snack time in the afternoons. To solve the problem of the 
wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot, a ball of 
maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.

On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains, the children 
carry whole grains to munch along the trail. They learn to like 
these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the 
oats he was feeding his horse at chore time. They tasted good to him, 
so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk 
and honey.   Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods 
on the school grounds. This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar 
on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking. Candy is 
not allowed. Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats 
consisting of fruit and nuts, but no candy. 

#NOURISHING MEALS# 

Mr& Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit, hot cereal, 
milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs. The heavy 
meal comes in the middle of the day. Soup is often the important dish 
at supper. Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich in dissolved 
minerals and vitamins.   The school finds that the children 
are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high 
in quality. The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a 
day. 

#OUTDOOR EXERCISES#

Even before he saw the necessity of growing 
better food and planning good nutrition, Mr& Clark felt the school 
had a good health program. Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and 
a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule. A vigorous 
program existed in skiing, skating sports and overnight hiking. 

#HEALTHIER 
CHILDREN#

Since the change to better nutrition, he feels he 
can report on improvements in health, though he considers the following 
statements observations and not scientific proof.   Visitors to 
the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring 
out the sheen. The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.

BUFFETED by swirling winds, the little green biplane struggled 
northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf. Wires 
whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine 
roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit. He 
peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again 
below.   "Good old iron compass"! he thought.   A plume 
of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind 
a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored 
to set the ruptured roadbed to rights. The girders of a shattered 
Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream. Vermont's 
main railroad line was prostrate. And in the dark days after the Great 
Flood of 1927- the worst natural disaster in the state's 
history- 
the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United 
States mails.   Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen 
for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday, 
November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's 
Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for 
Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight. Clerks and postmasters 
shoveled muck out of their offices- those who still had offices- 
and wondered how to move the mail. The state's railroad system 
counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way: it would 
obviously remain out of commission for weeks. And once medicine, 
food, clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims, 
communications and the mail were the next top problems.   From 
Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain 
to the railroad at Port Kent, N& Y&. But what came in was piling 
up. The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord, 
N& H&. When Governor Al Smith offered New York National 
Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed 
a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that 
at Montpelier too.   The question was "Where to land"? 
There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont. Burlington aviator 
John J& Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort 
Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots 
were bringing their wide-winged "Jenny" and DeHaviland two-seaters 
to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.   The only 
available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was 
on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where 
takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions. 
Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water, and 
bridges were crumpled and gone. Anticipating delivery of medicines 
and yeast by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee 
and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry, Vermont National 
Guard, laid out runways on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill. 
The "Barre Aviation Field" was set to receive its first 
aircraft the Sunday following the flood.   Though the makeshift 
airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to 
keep any kind of mail schedule. They had courage but their meager training 
consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out of established 
airports, And the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with 
the water cooled engines of their World War /1, planes. It seemed 
like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering 
the post office department to contract for the transport of first 
class mail by air. They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the 
terminals.   Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier 
in the right place at the right time: Robert S& Fogg, a native 
New Englander, had been a World War /1, flying instructor, barnstormer, 
and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport. Tall, 
wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical 
first in air mail history. Piloting a Curtiss Navy ~MF flying 
boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the original 
Rural Delivery air service in America.   During the excitement 
following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil 
aviators overnight became legendary heroes. In Concord, Bob 
Fogg 
was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings. Public-spirited 
backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at putting their 
city and state on the flying map. The ship was a Waco biplane, one 
of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225~HP 
Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind. A trim green and silver-painted 
craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the Waco was entered to 
compete in the "On-to-Spokane" Air Derby of 1927. As a matter 
of fact, Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the 
race- an engine oil leak forced him down- but the flying service 
and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his 
wry-faced backers. So with all this experience, Bob Fogg was a natural 
choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract. 
His work began just six days after the flood.   By airline 
from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles, counting 
a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier. 
The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back 
of the State House when the wind was right, and used Wilson flat 
above Barre when it wasn't. Between the unsafe Towne field and the 
long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to 
Wilson flat, arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory. 
Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck, begged the postal 
officials that met him to find a safer landing place, preferably 
on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River.   "But 
Fogg", they countered, "we can't get over there. And besides you 
seem to make it all right here". It took a tragedy to bring things 
to a head. After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind 
takeoffs, Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage 
of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field. Sent to 
Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red Cross Aide Reuben 
Sleight had been killed, and his pilot, Lt& Franklin Wolfe, badly 
injured. With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply 
flown into the hillside.   Faced with this situation, Postmaster 
Charles F& McKenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington 
trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the heights 
of Berlin. A long flat known as the St& John field seemed to answer 
their purpose, and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable, 
they decided to use it.   With a wary eye on the farmer's 
bull, Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr& St& John marked the 
field with a red table cloth. As a wind direction indicator, they tied 
a cotton rag to a sapling. With these aids, and a pair of skiis substituting 
for wheels on the Waco, Bob Fogg made the first landing on 
what is now part of the Barre-Montpelier Airport on November 21, 
1927.   Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail 
pouches. During the second week of operations, Fogg received a telegram 
from the Post Office Department, asking him to "put on two airplanes 
and make two flights daily, plus one Sunday trip". Since 
Fogg's was a one-man, one-plane flying service, this meant that he 
would have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day, under sub-freezing
