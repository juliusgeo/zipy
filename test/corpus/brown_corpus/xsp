in that dry and dusty and uncolored field.   I got on the tractor 
again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was 
drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a 
danger of rocks. I had my back to the corner of the triangular field 
that pointed towards the house. The earth was a little heavy and I 
had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring 
properly, and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned 
the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field, 
a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake. 
I saw it all at a glance. The boy was there at the lower corner of 
the field, and he was in the plowed earth, stamping with ferocity and 
a kind of frenzied impatience. Even at that distance, with no sound but 
the sound of the tractor, I could tell the fierce mark of brutality 
on the boy. I could see the hunched-up shoulders, the savage determination, 
the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels, 
and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick.

Stop it, I shouted, but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on, 
above anything I could say. I stopped the tractor and I shouted 
down to the boy, and I knew he could hear me, for the morning was clear 
and still, but he did not even hesitate in that brutal, murdering 
dance. It was no use. I felt myself tremble, thinking of the diamond 
light of that beauty I had held a few moments before, and I wanted 
to run down there and halt, if I could, that frenetic pirouette, catch 
the boy in the moment of his savagery, and save a glimmer, a remnant, 
of that which I remembered, but I knew it was already too late. I 
drove the tractor on, not looking down there; I was afraid to look 
for fear the evil might still be going on. My head began to ache, and 
the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes, and I hated the job 
suddenly, and I thought, there are only moments when one sees beautiful 
things, and these are soon crushed, or they vanish. I felt the 
anger mount within me.   The boy waited at the corner, with the 
jar of water held up to me in his hands, and the water had grown bubbly 
in the heat of the morning. I knew the boy well. He was eleven and 
we had done many things together. He was a beautiful boy, really, with 
finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face, and 
his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike, and his eyes were blue. 
He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up, as he would 
smile on any other day. He was my nephew, my brother's son, handsome 
and warm and newly-scrubbed, with happiness upon his face and his face 
resembled my brother's and mine as well.   I saw then, too, 
the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil, through something 
there where I had been not long before.   I stopped the tractor 
and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me. "Can I 
ride around with you"? he asked, as he often did, and I had as often 
let him be on the tractor beside me. I looked closely at his eyes, 
and he was already innocent; the killing was already forgotten in 
that clear mind of his.   "No, you cannot", I said, pushing 
aside the water jar he offered to me. I pointed to the splintered, upright 
stake. "Did you do that"? I asked.   "Yes", he 
said, eagerly, beginning a kind of dance of excitement. "I killed 
a snake; it was a big one". He tried to take my hand to show 
me.   "Why did you kill it"?   "Snakes are ugly and 
bad".   "This snake was very beautiful. Didn't you see 
how beautiful it was"?   "Snakes are ugly", he said again.

"You saw the colors of it, didn't you? Have you ever 
seen anything like it around here"?   "Snakes are ugly and 
bad, and it might have bitten somebody, and they would have died".

"You know there are no poisonous snakes in this area. This 
snake could not harm anything".   "They eat chickens sometimes", 
the boy said. "They are ugly and they eat chickens and I 
hate snakes".   "You are talking foolishly", I said. "You 
killed it because you wanted to kill it, for no other reason".

"They're ugly and I hate them", the boy insisted. "Nobody 
likes snakes".   "It was beautiful", I said, half to 
myself.   The boy skipped along beside me, and he was contented 
with what he had done.   The fire of the colors was gone; there 
was a contorted ugliness now; the colors of its back were dull and 
gray-looking, torn and smashed in, and dirty from the boy's shoes. 
The beautifully-tapered head, so delicate and so cool, had been flattened 
as if in a vise, and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted, 
torn mouth. The snake was hideous, and I remembered, even then, the 
cool, bright fire of it only a little while before, and I thought 
perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that, and had 
not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life.   I wrenched 
the stake out, that the boy had driven through it in the thickest 
part of its body, between the colored diamond crystals. I touched it 
and the coolness, the ice-feeling, was gone, and even then it moved a 
little, perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles, and I hoped that it 
was truly dead, so that I would not have to kill it. And then it moved 
a little more, and I knew the snake was dying, and I would have 
to kill it there. The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again 
and he was racing innocently in circles, making the buzzing tractor 
sound with his lips.   I'm sorry, I thought to the snake, 
for you were beautiful. I took the broken length of it around the tractor 
and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its 
head, not looking at it, to kill it at last, for it could never live.

The boy came around behind me, dragging the stake. "It's 
a big snake, isn't it"? he said. "I'm going to tell everybody 
how big a snake I killed".   "Don't you see what you 
have done"? I said. "Don't you see the difference now"?

"It's an ugly, terrible snake", he said. He came up and 
was going to push at it with his heavy shoes. I could see the happiness 
in the boy's eyes, the gleeful brutality.   "Don't", 
I said. I could have slapped the boy. He looked up at me, puzzled, 
and he swayed his head from side to side. I thought, you little brute, 
you nasty, selfish, little beast, with brutality already developed 
within that brain and in those eyes. I wanted to slap his face, to 
wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth, and I decided 
then, very suddenly, what I would do.

Cady didn't come unglued easily, but this had not been a day 
of glad tidings. Tax worries, production worries, personnel worries, 
and the letter from Hanford College, his own alma mater, a real snapper.

Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago. 
Yes, the boy's credentials were in order- scholastic transcript, 
character references, picture, health record, successful college boards. 
But due to the many applicants on file, would he co-operate and write 
a personal letter giving them his son's motivation, interests and 
his qualifications for leadership?   Cady Partlow lit his 
pipe with no comfort. This was it. This was the letter which would 
or would not enroll his son, David, in Hanford. His son who had never 
held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life. 
His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor, lawyer, merchant 
or chief.   He wondered if he had played it wrong. Maybe 
he should have kept in touch. Gone back for reunions. But he had been 
busy building a business, being a big man in his own town just as 
he had been a big man at Hanford, Class of 1935. Besides, Cady Partlow 
knew he wasn't the old-grad-type.   It wouldn't help 
anyway. 
Look at Pete Alcorn, who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game 
in fifteen years. Pete's son was rejected. Hanford College, 
Little 
Ivy League, had no room for football players with low grades.

Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride. Good 
solid ~B average with a sprinkling of ~A's in math and science. 
Imagine his son being that good in science! Mr& Partlow could 
still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered 
what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford. But then, 
he hadn't studied very hard. Getting elected president of the student 
body took a lot of time and politicking. ##

He put down his 
pipe and started to type. 
"In response to your letter, I can in good 
conscience recommend my son, David, in the field of leadership".

He stopped and looked at the picture of his son, the picture on 
his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate 
for Hanford College. He didn't have to be told his son looked 
like him. David had the same gray eyes, high cheekbones, dark hair 
and a certain rugged ugliness. Height, 6'. Weight, 160. Health, 
excellent.   He turned back to the typewriter with a little more 
confidence. "His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics, 
tennis and swimming. His chief motivation for enrolling at 
Hanford is the desire to"-   Mr& Partlow banged his fist 
on the keyboard, ruining the letter. He paced to the window and looked 
at the city he had helped to build.   How do you tell a college 
president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do? That 
you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him 
into a profession so you can say at the club, "Of course David has 
known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer"- or a lawyer, 
or an editor?   How do you tell a college like Hanford that 
your son has a vast potential, that he will find himself? Just give 
him time, give him a chance.   Cady snapped the Venetian blind 
shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter, rolled in a fresh 
sheet, and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed 
on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head.

What a production to make of a letter commending your own son! 
His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic. He 
told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics. He 
told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities. 
He belonged to a social club, a civic group, little theater, swimming 
team, and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer 
of the science club.   He finished with a flurry of good 
wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter. There, that did it. 
Then he met the grave eyes of his wife, Anne, from the photograph 
next to David's. He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket.

Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything. 
After all, his wife had written most of his letters for him in those 
first lean days of Partlow Products. Anne had a way with words. Half 
of it was natural, half was Smith College.   Yet the whole 
of Anne was something she had never learned in any college. A woman 
had it or she didn't. Anne had it. She said what she meant and let 
it be. She never got on his back. He could take the advice or leave 
it.   He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he 
got on the elevator.   "You look like you just heard a real gasser, 
Mr& Partlow".   Cady looked at Tom, who had taken 
him 
up and down for fifteen years. "I was just thinking how things have 
changed. When I went to college they begged you to come. Be our 
guest! It's our pleasure! Now you have to be well rounded, firm 
in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge"!   Tom slid 
open 
the door to the lobby. "That's a fact, Mr& Partlow. My John 
applied to six colleges before he got in".   "Going to 
State"?   "No. He's president of the rocket club here, 
you know. Always messing around with science stuff. Real bright along 
those lines, you might say. He got a science scholarship to Yale".

"Oh",
