majority of cities and towns. There are at least two problems to consider: 
one is a matter of adjusting the fiscal calendar; the other 
is how to finance the adjustments when necessary. The latter matter 
is considered in detail in a later section.   Twelve cities and 
towns in Rhode Island presently indicate some plans to establish a 
uniform and/or coordinated fiscal-tax year calendar. Plans vary from 
the "talking stage" to establishing special committees to accomplish 
this end. What is important here is that many of the cities and towns 
recognize the need for improved fiscal practices and are taking the 
initiative to obtain them.   An analysis of the fiscal-tax collection 
year calendars throughout the state indicates that transition 
may not be as painful as is commonly thought. However, it must be stressed 
that much depends upon the financial condition of the individual 
cities and towns involved.   The adjustments needed to establish 
a uniform and coordinated fiscal-tax collection year calendar throughout 
Rhode Island, based on a July 1-June 30 year, are shown below. 
_NO ADJUSTMENT NEEDED._ Six cities and towns are presently on a 
July 1-June 30 fiscal year and have coordinated their tax collection 
year with it. No change is required for these towns. These municipalities 
include: Barrington, Lincoln, Middletown, Newport, North 
Kingstown, and South Kingstown. _ADJUSTMENT OF FISCAL YEAR._ 
One town and one city, Coventry and East Providence, require an adjustment 
of their fiscal year only. This change will automatically adjust 
their tax collection year calendar so as to make all tax installments 
due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year. 
_ADJUSTMENT OF TAX COLLECTION YEAR._ Six cities and towns are now 
on a July 1-June 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust their 
tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity. These cities and 
towns include Bristol, Glocester, Pawtucket, Cumberland, Central 
Falls, and Woonsocket. _SIMULTANEOUS ADJUSTMENTS._ Two cities 
to be considered, Providence and Cranston, are an enigma. Both have 
excellent integration of their fiscal-tax collection year calendars. 
However, neither of these two cities is on the desired July 1-June 
30 fiscal year.   The adjustment to a uniform and coordinated fiscal 
period could be accomplished relatively easy for them. In that 
both cities end their fiscal years on September 30, they could levy taxes 
for an interim period of nine months, commencing with September 
30 and ending with June 30. These three installment dates would be: 
October 26, January 26, and April 25 (Providence) and November 
15, February 16 and May 15 (Cranston). Both would start their new 
fiscal year on July 1. Their tax collection calendar could then be: 
July 25, October 26, January 26, and April 25, (Providence); 
and August 15, November 15, February 17, and May 15, (Cranston). 
Under this plan both Cranston and Providence would be on the uniform 
fiscal year but would still be using the same installment periods. 
_VARYING ADJUSTMENTS._ The remaining twenty-three towns have fiscal 
years which end prior to June 30. All of these towns will require 
adjustments of both their fiscal and tax collection years. Assuming 
an adjustment to the July 1-June 30 fiscal year, the required adjustment 
of the tax collection years and the towns involved are shown in Table 
3. 

#METHODS OF FINANCING ADJUSTMENTS#

Aside from the matter 
of adjusting the fiscal and tax calendars, there is the problem of financing 
the adjustment when this is necessary. It should be emphasized 
strongly that adjustments in fiscal dates or adoption of interim budgets 
<do not necessarily> mean financing over and above normal governmental 
requirements. In many communities there is simply no financial 
problem; it is only a matter of adjusting accounting methods, careful 
fiscal planning and management, or some like combination of techniques. 
In other municipalities the difficulties in overcoming the financial 
burden have been sufficiently great to dishearten proponents of 
fiscal year changes. Fortunately, such cases in Rhode Island are more 
the exception than the rule.   As shown earlier in Table 1, 
the several cities and towns use widely varied fiscal and tax collection 
calendars. In addition, no two Rhode Island communities are identical 
in relation to their over-all financial condition. These factors 
practically insure that no single financing formula is feasible; each 
situation must be studied and a plan developed that takes into consideration 
such factors as the effect of the existing and prospective 
tax calendars, the financial condition of the treasuries, and the length 
of the transition interval. Suitable plans range from those that are 
very easy to develop to those that are difficult to formulate and require 
borrowing ranging from short-term serial notes to long-term bonds.

The financial problem, where it exists, usually stems from 
the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period. For 
those communities which have financial difficulties in effecting adjustments, 
there are a number of alternatives any one of which alone, 
or in combination with others, would minimize if not even eliminate the 
problem. 

#RHODE ISLAND HERITAGE WEEK PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE,JR& 
GOVERNOR#

The theme of Rhode Island Heritage Week for 1961 will 
be "Independence and Union". It commemorates the 185th anniversary 
of Rhode Island's Independence when, upon May 4, 1776, the 
General Assembly, by its action, established the first free republic 
in the New World.   As this year marks the centennial of the 
beginning of the Civil War, this fact is being commemorated with several 
exhibits throughout the State, but most of all paying tribute to 
the first Rhode Island Volunteers who rushed to the defense of the 
City of Washington, putting at the disposal of President Lincoln 
the only fully equipped and best trained regiment at this time.

On April 30, ceremonies commemorating the departure of these volunteers 
will take place at 1:00 P&M& at the Dexter Training Grounds 
in Providence. The Independence Day celebration will be properly 
observed with a big military and civic parade from West Warwick 
to the Greene Homestead in Anthony; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, 
JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE 
PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF APRIL 29TH TO MAY 7TH, 1961, 
AS RHODE ISLAND HERITAGE WEEK, advising our citizens that throughout 
this week many historic houses and beautiful gardens will be open 
to visitors as well as industrial plants, craft shops, museums and libraries 
and I 
earnestly urge all to take advantage of these opportunities 
to see as many of these places as they can during this outstanding 
week.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand 
and caused the seal of the State to be affixed this 21st day of April, 
in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and sixty-one 
and on Independence, the one hundred and eighty-fifth.   Governor 

#ARMED FORCES DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& GOVERNOR# 

The year 1961 marks the fourteenth anniversary of the unification of 
our Armed Forces under the National Security Act of 1947. 
National defense, like the continuing search for peace with freedom 
and justice for all, is "everybody's business". Our investment 
in this effort, the greatest in our Nation's history, reflects our 
determination to ensure the peace and the future of freedom.   It 
is a sound investment. As the President has said, "only when our 
arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain that they will never 
be employed".   Armed Forces Day is the annual report on 
this investment, a public presentation designed to give our own people, 
and the people of other lands who stand with us for peace with freedom 
and justice, the best possible opportunity to see and understand what 
we have and why we have it.   It is the purpose of Armed Forces 
Day to give Americans an opportunity to honor men of the Armed 
Forces, those who have made the supreme sacrifice, those who remain 
to preserve our security. Freedom depends upon them; NOW, THEREFORE, 
DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND 
AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM SATURDAY, MAY 20th, 1961, 
AS ARMED FORCES DAY, reminding our citizens that we should rededicate 
ourselves to our Nation, respecting the uniforms as the guardians 
of our precious liberty.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have 
hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed 
this 17th day of May, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine hundred 
and sixty-one, and of Independence, the one hundred and eighty-sixth.

#NATIONAL MARITIME DAY PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& GOVERNOR# 

The President of the United States, pursuant to a Joint Resolution 
of Congress, has issued a proclamation each year since 1933 
declaring may 22nd to be National Maritime Day.   This date in 
1819 marked the sailing of the S& S& "Savannah" from Savannah, 
Georgia, for Liverpool. This voyage was the first successful 
crossing of the Atlantic under steam propulsion. The day is now appropriately 
set aside to honor the American men and women who have contributed 
to the success of our merchant marine fleet in peace and war.

The Merchant Marine is the "Fourth Arm of Defense", for 
a strong and effective American Merchant Marine is essential to 
the economy and security of our Nation.   Through trade and travel 
across the seas the American Merchant Marine is carrying out its 
historic mission of linking the United States of America with friendly 
nations across the seas; AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& 
NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, 
PROCLAIM MONDAY, MAY 22nd, 1961, AS NATIONAL MARITIME 
DAY, reminding our citizens that American Merchant ships and American 
seamen are ready at all times to serve our Nation in the cause 
of freedom and justice.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have 
hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed 
this 20th day of April, in the year of Our Lord, one thousand nine 
hundred and sixty-one, and of Independence, the one hundred and eighty-fifth.

#MISS RHODE ISLAND PAGEANT WEEK PROCLAMATION BY JOHN A& NOTTE, JR& 
GOVERNOR#

The Miss Rhode Island Pageant is sponsored by the 
Rhode Island Junior Chamber of Commerce as a part of the nation-wide 
search for the typical American girl- a Miss America from Rhode 
Island. This is an official preliminary contest of the Miss America 
Pageant held each September in Atlantic City. The ideal girl- 
possessed of talent, poise, intelligence, personality and beauty 
of face and figure- is chosen each year to represent Rhode Island.

Many hours are given free by the Jaycees to make this and all 
local pageants outstanding events. Proceeds realized from these pageants 
are used by the Jaycees to help support their various youth, health, 
welfare and community betterment activities throughout the state.

Miss Sally May Saabye, (Miss Rhode Island 1960) says that 
within a short time- on June 17th- her reign will come to an 
end. She hopes that all will support the contestants from our own community 
by attending our Pageants and the State Pageant June 17; 
AND NOW, THEREFORE, DO I, JOHN A& NOTTE, JR&, GOVERNOR OF THE STATE 
OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS, PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF 
JUNE 11TH TO 17TH, 1961, AS MISS RHODE ISLAND PAGEANT WEEK, with deep 
appreciation to the Jaycees, local and statewide, for the presentation 
of their beautiful Pageants and the encouragement of all Rhode 
Island girls to participate.   IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have 
hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the State to be affixed
