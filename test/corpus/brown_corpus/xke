fatuous. In a recent book called "World Peace Through World Law", 
two distinguished lawyers, Grenville Clark and Louis Sohn, call 
for just such an overhaul of the U&N&, basing their case on 
the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust. I believe that these proposals, 
however meritorious in terms of world needs, go far beyond our 
capacity to realize them. Such proposals look to an apocalyptic act, 
a kind of Lockian "social contract" on a world-wide scale. The 
defect of these proposals is in their attempt to outrun history and their 
assumption that because something may be desirable it is also possible.

A working concept of the organic evolution of community 
must lead us in a different direction. The failures of the U&N& 
and of other international organs suggest that we have already gone beyond 
what was internationally feasible. Our problem, therefore, is to 
devise processes more modest in their aspirations, adjusted to the real 
world of sovereign nation states and diverse and hostile communities. 
The history of the U&N& demonstrates that in a pluralistic 
world we must develop processes of influence and persuasion rather than 
coercion. It is possible that international organization will ultimately 
supplant the multi-state system, but its proper function for the 
immediate future is to reform and supplement that system in order to 
render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world. 
New machinery of coo^rdination should not be our primary objective 
in 
the foreseeable future- though perhaps the "political general staff" 
of Western leaders proposed by Sir Anthony Eden would serve 
a useful purpose. Generally, however, there is an abundance of available 
machinery of coo^rdination- in ~NATO, in O&E&C&D&, 
in the U&N& and elsewhere. The trouble with this machinery 
is that it is not used and the reason that it is not used is the absence 
of a conscious sense of community among the free nations.

Our proper objective, then, is the development of a new spirit, the 
realization of a potential community. A "concert of free nations" 
should take its inspiration from the traditions of the nineteenth century 
Concert of Europe with its common values and accepted "rules 
of the game". Constitutions of and by themselves mean little; the 
history of both the League of Nations and the United Nations demonstrates 
that. But a powerful sense of community, even with little 
or no machinery, means a great deal. That is the lesson of the nineteenth 
century.   A realistic "concert of free nations" might 
be expected to consist of an "inner community" of the North Atlantic 
nations and an "outer community" embracing much or all of the 
non-Communist world.

THE recent experiments in the new poetry-and-jazz movement 
seen by some as part of the "San Francisco Renaissance" have 
been as popular as they are notorious. "It might well start a craze 
like swallowing goldfish or pee wee golf", wrote Kenneth Rexroth 
in an explanatory note in the <Evergreen Review>, and he may have 
been right.   Under the general heading "poetry-and-jazz" widely 
divergent experiments have been carried out. Lawrence Ferlenghetti 
and Bruce Lippincott have concentrated on writing a new poetry 
for reading with jazz that is very closely related to both the musical 
forms of jazz, and the vocabulary of the musician. Even musicians themselves 
have taken to writing poetry. (Judy Tristano now has poems 
as well as ballads written for her.)   But the best known exploiters 
of the new medium are Kenneth Rexroth and Kenneth Patchen. Rexroth 
and Patchen are far apart musically and poetically in their experiments. 
Rexroth is a longtime jazz buff, a name-dropper of jazz heroes, 
and a student of traditional as well as modern jazz. In San Francisco 
he has worked with Brew Moore, Charlie Mingus, and other 
"swinging" musicians of secure reputation, thus placing himself within 
established jazz traditions, in addition to being a part of the 
San Francisco "School".   Although Patchen has given previous 
evidence of an interest in jazz, the musical group that he works 
with, the Chamber Jazz Sextet, is often ignored by jazz critics. (<Downbeat> 
did not mention the Los Angeles appearance of Patchen 
and the Sextet, although the engagement lasted over two months.) The 
stated goal of the ~CJS is the synthesis of jazz and "serious" 
music. Patchen's musicians are outsiders in established jazz circles, 
and Patchen himself has remained outside the San Francisco poetry 
group, maintaining a self-imposed isolation, even though his conversion 
to poetry-and-jazz is not as extreme or as sudden as it may first 
appear. He had read his poetry with musicians as early as 1951, and 
his entire career has been characterized by radical experiments with 
the form and presentation of his poetry. However, his subject matter 
and basic themes have remained surprisingly consistent, and these, together 
with certain key poetic images, may be traced through all his 
work, including the new jazz experiments.   From the beginning of 
his career, Patchen has adopted an anti-intellectual approach to poetry. 
His first book, <Before the Brave> (1936), is a collection 
of poems that are almost all Communistic, but after publication of this 
book he rejected 
Communism, and advocated a pacifistic anarchy, though 
retaining his revolutionary idiom. He spoke for a "proletariat" 
that included "all the lost and sick and hunted of the earth". Patchen 
believes that the world is being destroyed by power-hungry and 
money-hungry people. Running counter to the destroying forces in the 
world are all the virtues that are innate in man, the capacity for love 
and brotherhood, the ability to appreciate beauty. Beauty as well 
as love is redemptive, and Patchen preaches a kind of moral salvation. 
This salvation does not take the form of a Christian Heaven. In 
Patchen's eyes, organized churches are as odious as organized governments, 
and Christian symbols, having been taken over by the moneyed 
classes, are now agents of corruption. Patchen envisions a Dark Kingdom 
which "stands above the waters as a sentinel warning man of danger 
from his own kind". The Dark Kingdom sends Angels of Death 
and other fateful messengers down to us with stern tenderness. Actually 
Heaven and the Dark Kingdom overlap; they form two aspects of 
heavenly life after death.   Patchen has almost never used strict 
poetic forms; he has experimented instead with personal myth-making. 
Much of his earlier work was conceived in terms of a "pseudo-anthropological" 
myth reference, which is concerned with imaginary places 
and beings described in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language.

These early experiments were evidently not altogether satisfying 
to Patchen. Beginning in <Cloth of the Tempest> (1943) he experimented 
in merging poetry and visual art, using drawings to carry long 
narrative segments of a story, as in <Sleepers Awake>, and constructing 
elaborate "poems-in-drawing-and-type" in which it is impossible 
to distinguish between 
the "art" and the poetry. Art "makings" 
or pseudo-anthropological myths did not meet all of Patchen's requirements 
for a poetic frame of reference. Many of his poems purported 
to be exactly contemporary and political; so during the period approximately 
from 1941 to 1946, Patchen often used private detective stories 
as a myth reference, and the "private eye" as a myth hero. Speaking 
in terms of sociological stereotype, the "private eye" might 
appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reasons. The private 
detective (at least in the minds of listeners and readers all over 
the country) is an individual hero fighting injustice. He is usually 
something of an underdog, he must battle the organized police force as 
well as recognized criminals. The private detective must rely, as the 
Youngest Son or Trickster Hero does in primitive myth, on his wits. 
The private detective is militant against injustice, a humorous 
and ironic explorer of the underworld; most important to Patchen, he 
was a non-literary hero, and very contemporary. In 1945, probably almost 
every American not only knew who Sam Spade was, but had some 
kind of emotional feeling about him. In <The Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer> 
(1945) Patchen exploited this national sentiment by making 
his hero, Albert Budd, a private detective.   But since 1945, 
Sam Spade has undergone a metamorphosis; he has become Friday 
on <Dragnet>, a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority. He has, 
like so many other secular and religious culture symbols, gone over to 
the side of the ruling classes. Obviously, the "private eye" can 
have no more appeal for Patchen. To fill the job of contemporary hero 
in 1955, Patchen needed someone else.   It was logical that 
he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician. The revolution 
in jazz that took place around 1949, the evolution from the "bebop" 
school of Dizzy Gillespie to the "cool" sound of Miles 
Davis and Lennie Tristano, Lee Konitz, and the whole legend of 
Charlie Parker, had made an impression on many academic and literary 
men. The differentiation between the East Coast and West Coast schools 
of jazz, the differences between the "hard bop" school of Rollins, 
and the "cerebral" experiments of Tristano, Konitz and 
Marsh, the general differences in the mores of white and negro musicians, 
all had become fairly well known to certain segments of the public. 
The immense amount of interest that the new jazz had for the younger 
generation must have impressed him, and he began working toward the 
merger of jazz and poetry, as he had previously attempted the union 
of graphic art and poetry. In addition to his experiments in reading 
poetry to jazz, Patchen is beginning to use the figure of the modern 
jazz musician as a myth hero in the same way he used the figure of the 
private detective a decade ago. In this respect, his approach to poetry-and-jazz 
is in marked contrast to Kenneth Rexroth's. Rexroth 
uses many of his early poems when he reads to jazz, including many of 
his Chinese and Japanese translations; he usually draws some kind 
of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he is reading- 
for instance, he draws the parallel between a poem he reads about an Oriental 
courtesan waiting for the man she loves, and who never comes, 
and the old blues chants of Ma Rainy and other Negro singers- but 
usually the comparison is specious. Rexroth may sometimes achieve an 
effective juxtaposition, but he rarely makes any effort to capture any 
jazz "feeling" in the text of his poems, relying on his very competent 
musicians to supply this feeling.   Patchen does read some 
of his earlier works to music, but he has written an entire book of 
short poems which seem to be especially suited for reading with jazz. 
These new poems have only a few direct references to jazz and jazz musicians, 
but they show changes in Patchen's approach to his poetry, 
for he has tried to enter into and understand the emotional attitude 
of the jazz musician.   It is difficult to draw the line between 
stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician. Everyone knows that 
private detectives in real life are not like Sam Spade and Pat Novak, 
but the real and the imaginary musician are closely linked. Seen 
by the public, the musician is the underdog <par excellence>. He 
is forced to play for little money, and must often take another job to 
live. His approach to music is highly individualistic; the accent 
is on improvisation rather than arrangements. While he is worldly, the 
musician often cultivates public attitudes of childlike astonishment 
and naivete. The musician is non-intellectual and non-verbal; he 
is far from being a literary hero, yet is a creative artist. Many of 
these aspects will be seen as comparable to those of the ideal detective, 
but where the detective is active and militant, the jazz musician 
is passive, almost a victim of society. In order to write with authority 
either about musicians, or as a musician, Patchen would have to soft 
pedal his characteristically outspoken anger, and change (at least 
for the purposes of this poetry) from a revolutionary to a victim. He 
must become one who knows all about the injustice in the world, but 
who declines doing anything about it.   This involves a shift in 
Patchen's attitude and it is a first step toward writing a new jazz 
poetry. He has shown considerable ingenuity in adapting his earliest 
symbols and devices to the new work, and the fact that he has kept a 
body of constant symbols through all of his experiments gives an unexpected 
continuity to his poetry. Perhaps tracing some of these more important 
symbols through the body of his work will show that Patchen's 
new poetry is well thought out, and remains within the mainstream 
of his work, while being suited to a new form.   Henry Miller characterized 
Patchen as a "man of anger and light". His revolutionary 
anger is apparent in most of his early poems. The following passage
