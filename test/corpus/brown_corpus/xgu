worth the effort. It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter 
of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal. Wine stored 
for a long time should be on its side; otherwise, the cork dries 
and air enters to spoil it. When stacking wine on its side in a bin, 
care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next 
to the cork. Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling 
around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard 
or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture. 
Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again with ill effects. 
The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine (provided the eye 
has not already spotted it) is to smell the wet end of the cork after 
pulling it: if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right; 
if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.   Seasonal 
rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine: they age it prematurely. 
The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five 
degrees, with an allowable range of five degrees above or below 
this, provided there are no sudden or frequent changes. Prolonged vibration 
is also undesirable; consequently, one's wine closet or cellar 
should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces. If 
one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have 
one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time. 
Light, especially daylight, is always bad for wine.   All in 
all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations 
thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking; many people go 
to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without 
further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious 
cork. No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure 
they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning 
is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree 
of purism! But the fact remains that in most restaurants, including 
some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle 
is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered, 
and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place 
while the chef is preparing the meal. A white wine, already at cool 
cellar temperature, may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and 
water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator (the former is far 
preferable) in about fifteen minutes; for those who live in a winter 
climate, there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow. Though 
by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought 
from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so 
before serving time. It may be a bit cold when poured; but again, 
as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should 
be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is never filled more 
than half full. In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly- 
and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste 
and fragrance until after the middle of the meal (or the course), in 
the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting 
stages. The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming 
a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an 
open fire. This invariably effaces any wine's character, and drives 
its fragrance underground.   It should not be forgotten that 
wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly 
in Magnums- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams, 
Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively. Very old red wines 
often require several hours of aeration, and any red wine, brought from 
the cellar within half an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed 
some air. But white wines never! White wines should be opened 
when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their 
sweetness. Thus, Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold; a Pouilly-Fuisse 
or a Chablis somewhat less cold. Over-chilling is an accepted 
method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white 
wine, especially a dry wine- and certainly less of a crime than serving 
a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive. 
The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death 
when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air. To quote 
Professor Saintsbury: "The last glass of claret or Burgundy 
is as good as the first; but the first glass of Chateau d'Yquem 
or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last"! This does not 
mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration: there 
is a reasonable limit- and wines kept over to the next meal or 
the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good. If 
this must be done, they should always be corked and kept in a cool place; 
it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably 
shorter than those of milk.   A few red wines, notably those 
of the Beaujolais, are better consumed at cellar temperature. By 
tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature- 
if anything a little cooler- and be aged enough for the tannin 
and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well. Thus, 
red wine must, if possible, never be disturbed or shaken; very old 
red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which 
have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself. 
A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may 
do as much harm as a week at sea. The cork should be pulled gradually 
and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.   Many 
people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully 
from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without 
disturbing the sediment. Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and 
insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand 
on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom, 
after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position 
on its side in the cradle.   In France, when one wishes to entertain 
at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the 
restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice 
of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them. The wine 
waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened 
at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on 
end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines, 
be decanted. Decanting old wine aerates it fully; it may also be- 
practically speaking- a matter of good economy. For, in the process 
of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead of several 
or more times at the table: hence, a minimum of the undesirable mixture 
of wine and dregs.   Though there are many exceptions, which 
we have noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best consumed 
between two and six years old, and red wines, nowadays, between three 
and ten. Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep 
longer; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite 
number, red Burgundy. Some clarets do not come into their own until 
they are ten or fifteen years of age, or even more. If a red Bordeaux 
of a good name and year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting, 
leave it alone for a while. Most of the wines of Beaujolais, on 
the other hand, <should> be drunk while very young; and Alsatians 
<may> be. 
Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically: "Rest assured that 
your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter 
and Spirit strictly complied with **h and most particularly in regard 
to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane 
views".   Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation. 
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's 
overseer. An excellent crop was expected that year. 
William, 
who lived in neighboring St& Mary's parish, had taken charge and 
decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated 
for another year. Giffen advised acceptance of this plan, citing the 
depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions 
at the plantation. If sold then, the land and improvements might 
bring only $5,000. Early in January, 1844 he had a conference with 
Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning of Gorham's 
intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother. 
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs, 
he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless 
Negroes. They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation, 
and Louisiana law required their removal from the state. Gorham 
refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how 
much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the 
North involved? The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was 
not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes 
who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves. Henry hid 
his annoyance, although both he and William were furious with their 
Yankee brother. William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen 
that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would 
sue "amicably" to protect his interests.   Palfrey was 
determined 
that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers 
during the transition period before emancipation. If William wished 
to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes 
undisturbed and pay them "as high wages to remain there as are ever 
paid the labor of persons of their sex + age. A disposition to exert 
themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them 
**h to come into the scheme. Their having family ties on our plantation 
+ the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement". When he heard 
of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could 
be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages. If not, he was willing 
to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block 
his ultimate aim. William was adamant on one point: under no circumstances 
would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his 
and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom. Knowing 
the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the 
number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them 
to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia. Lacking specific 
instructions, he agreed to William's condition.   In March 
there was a division of the slaves, and Giffen carried out his instructions 
as nearly as possible. Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded 
in getting a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females. "I considered 
that your views would be best carried out", he explained, 
"by taking women whose progeny will of course be free + more fully extend 
the philantrophy of Emancipation. I have also taken the old servants 
of your father as a matter of Conscience + Justice". The ages 
of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to 
an unnamed newborn child. If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the 
wickedness of slavery, they were put aside after he received an inventory 
of the slave property he had inherited. This cold reckoning of human 
worth in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity, was all 
he needed. Each human being, known only by a given name, had a cash value. 
Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150; 
Rose, a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential, was worth $400. 
In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey 
was giving up close to $7,000.   Palfrey's brothers each received 
lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed 
that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66. Thus twenty "black 
souls" were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land 
of free men. Giffen extracted one concession from William: the house 
servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.

Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans for freeing 
his slaves in Louisiana. Yet even if he could get the necessary approval, 
fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special 
permission. According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty 
years old before he could be freed. Palfrey petitioned the state legislature 
to waive the requirement. Otherwise, freedom would mean removal 
from the state in which "as the place of their past residence from 
birth, or for many years, it would **h be materially for their advantage 
to be at liberty to remain". On March 11 the Louisiana legislature 
voted unanimously to table the petition. News of the legislative 
veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William 
became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt 
in advance. Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of 
the New Orleans <Courier,> shouting that the emancipation scheme 
had become a public affair, and that it would reach the "Ears of the 
People on the Plantation, and make them restless + unhappy".
