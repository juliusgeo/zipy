of a gold crucifix around the neck of a wounded Filipino. The colored 
boy had it, and Trig lunged at him with a knife and said, 'Give 
that to me, you black bastard. We don't 'low nigras to walk on 
the same sidewalk with white men where I come from'.   "The 
Negro got a bad slice on his chest from the knife wound".   "What 
did the Colonel do about the men"? Jane asked in her placid, 
interested way.   Mickie laughed. "He recommended both of 
them for the ~DSM and the Detroit fellow for the Purple Heart, 
too, for a combat-inflicted wound. So you see Mr& Christiansen 
knows what it's all about. But not Jeff Lawrence. When he was in 
the war, he was in Law or Supplies or something like that, and an 
old buddy of his told me he would come down on Sundays to the Pentagon 
and read the citations for medals- just like the one we sent in for 
Trig- and go away with a real glow. These were heroes nine feet 
tall to him". ##

Jefferson Lawrence was alone at the small, perfectly 
appointed table by the window looking out over the river. He 
had dinner and sat there over his coffee watching the winding pattern 
of traffic as it crossed the bridge and spread out like a serpent with 
two heads. Open beside him was <Mrs& Dalloway>. He thought how 
this dainty, fragile older woman threading her way through the streets 
of Westminster on a day in June, enjoying the flowers in the shops, 
the greetings from old friends, but never really drawing a deep, passionate 
breath, was so like himself. He, and Mrs& Dalloway, too, 
had never permitted themselves the luxury of joys that dug into the 
bone marrow of the spirit.   He had not because he was both poor 
and ambitious. Poverty imposes a kind of chastity on the ambitious. 
They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of cars 
along a dark country lane. No, they must look the other way and climb 
one more painful step up the ladder. He made the decision with his 
eyes open, or so he thought. At any cost, he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania 
mining town where his father was a pharmacist. And so he 
had, so he had. At State College, he had no time to walk among the 
violets on the water's edge. From his room he could look out in springtime 
and see the couples hand in hand walking slowly, deliciously, 
across the campus, and he could smell the sweet vernal winds. He was 
not stone. He was not unmoved. He had to teach himself patiently that 
these traps were not for him. He must mentally pull the blinds and 
close the window, so that all that existed was in the books before him. 
At law school, the same. More of this stamping down of human emotion 
as a young lawyer in New York. By the time he was prosperous enough- 
his goals were high- he was bald and afraid of women. The only 
one who would have him was his cripple, the strange unhappy woman 
who became his wife. Perhaps it was right; perhaps it was just. He 
had dared to defy nature, to turn his back to the Lorelei, and he was 
punished. Like Mrs& Dalloway, with her regrets about Peter Walsh, 
he had his moments of melancholy over a youth too well spent. If 
he had had a son, he would tell him, "Gather ye rosebuds while ye 
may **h This same flower that smiles today tomorrow will be dying". 
But then his son could afford it.   Lawrence was waiting for Bill 
Boxell. The Vice President had called and asked if he could see 
the Secretary at his home. He said the matter was urgent. The Secretary 
was uneasy about the visit. He did not like Boxell. He suspected 
something underhanded and furtive about him. Lawrence could not 
put his finger on it precisely, and this worried him. When you disliked 
or distrusted a man, you should have a reason. Human nature was 
not a piece of meat you could tell was bad by its smell. Lawrence stared 
a minute at the lighted ribbon of traffic, hoping that a clue to his 
dislike of the Vice President would appear. It did not. Therefore, 
he decided he was unfair to the young man and should make an effort 
to understand and sympathize with his point of view.   A half 
hour later the Vice President arrived. He looked very carefully at 
every piece of furnishing, as though hoping to store this information 
carefully in his mind. He observed the Florentine vase in the hall, 
the Renoir painting in the library, as well as the long shelves of well-bound 
volumes; the pattern of the Oriental rug, the delicate cut-glass 
chandelier.   He said to the Secretary, "I understand 
you came from a little Pennsylvania town near Wilkes-Barre. How did 
you find out about this"? He waved his arm around at the furnishings.

It was not a discourteous question, Lawrence decided. 
This young man had so little time to learn he had to be curious; 
he had to find out. The Secretary did not tell him at what cost, at 
what loneliness, he learned these things. He merely said, "Any good 
decorator these days can make you a tasteful home".   The Vice 
President said, "If you hear of any names that would fix me cheap 
in return for advertising they decorated the Vice President's 
home, let me know. I can do business with that kind".   Again, 
Lawrence thought a little sadly, these were the fees of poverty and 
ambition. Boxell did not have the chance to grow up graciously. He 
had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years.   They 
had brandy in the library. Boxell looked at Lawrence with a searching 
glance, the kind that a prosecuting attorney would give a man on trial. 
What are your weaknesses? Where will you break? How best to 
destroy your peace?   The Vice President said with a slight 
bluster, "There isn't anyone who loves the President more than 
I do. Old Chris is my ideal. At the same time, you have to face facts 
and realize that a man who's been in the Marine Corps all his 
life doesn't understand much about politics. What does a monk know 
about sex"?   Lawrence listened with the practiced, deceptive 
calm of the lawyer, but his face was in the shadow.   "So, 
we have to protect the old man for his own good. You see what I mean. 
Congress is full of politicians, and if you want to get along with 
them, you have to be politic. This is why I say we just can't go ahead 
and disarm the Germans and pull down our own defenses. Let me tell 
you what happened to me today. A fellow came up to me, a Senator, 
I don't have to tell you his name, and he told me, 'I love the 
President like a brother, but God damn it, he's crucifying me. I've 
got a quarter of a million Germans in my state, and those krautheads 
tune in on Father Werther every night, and if he tells them to 
go out and piss in the public square, that's what they do. He's 
telling them now to write letters to their Congressmen opposing the disarmament 
of Germany'. And another one comes to me and he says, 'Look 
here, there's a mill in my state employs five thousand people 
making uniforms for the Navy. 
The Bishop looked at him coldly and said "Take it or leave it"!

Literally, there was nothing else to do. He was caught in 
a machine. But Sojourner was not easily excited or upset and said quite 
calmly: "Let's go and see what it's like".   Annisberg 
was about seventy-five miles west of Birmingham, near the Georgia 
border and on the Tallahoosa River, a small and dirty stream. The 
city was a center of manufacture, especially in textiles, and also 
because of the beauty of some of its surroundings, a residence for many 
owners of the great industries in north Alabama. But it had, as was 
usual in southern cities of this sort, a Black Bottom, a low region 
near the river where the Negroes lived- servants and laborers huddled 
together in a region with no sewage save the river, where streets 
and sidewalks were neglected and where there was much poverty and crime.

Wilson came by train from Birmingham and looked the city 
over; the rather pleasant white city was on the hill where the chief 
stores were. Beyond were industries and factories. Then they went down 
to Black Bottom. In the midst of this crowded region was the Allen 
African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was an old and dirty 
wooden structure, sadly in need of repair. But it was a landmark. It 
had been there 50 years or more and everybody in town, black and white, 
knew of it. It had just suffered a calamity, the final crisis in a 
long series of calamities. For the old preacher who had been there twenty-five 
years was dead, and the city mourned him.   He was a 
loud-voiced man, once vigorous but for many years now declining in strength 
and ability. He was stern and overbearing with his flock, but obsequious 
and conciliatory with the whites, especially the rich who partly 
supported the church. The Deacon Board, headed by a black man 
named Carlson, had practically taken over as the pastor grew old, and 
had its way with the support of the Amen corner. The characteristic 
thing about this church was its Amen corner and the weekly religious 
orgy. A knot of old worshippers, chiefly women, listened weekly to a 
sermon. It began invariably in low tones, almost conversational, and 
then gradually worked up to high, shrill appeals to God and man. And 
then the Amen corner took hold, re-enacting a form of group participation 
in worship that stemmed from years before the Greek chorus, spreading 
down through the African forest, overseas to the West Indies, 
and then here in Alabama. With shout and slow dance, with tears and 
song, with scream and contortion, the corner group was beset by hysteria 
and shivering, wailing, shouting, possession of something that seemed 
like an alien and outside force. It spread to most of the audience 
and was often viewed by visiting whites who snickered behind handkerchief 
and afterward discussed Negro religion. It sometimes ended in 
death-like trances with many lying exhausted and panting on chair and 
floor. To most of those who composed the Amen corner it was a magnificent 
and beautiful experience, something for which they lived from week 
to week. It was often re-enacted in less wild form at the Wednesday 
night prayer meeting.   Wilson, on his first Sunday, witnessed 
this with something like disgust. He had preached a short sermon, 
trying to talk man-to-man to the audience, to tell them who he was, what 
he had done in Macon and Birmingham, and what he proposed to do here. 
He sympathized with them on the loss of their old pastor. But then, 
at mention of that name, the Amen corner broke loose. He had no 
chance to say another word. At the very end, when the audience was silent 
and breathless, a collection was taken and then slowly everyone 
filed out. The audience did not think much of the new pastor, and what 
the new pastor thought of the audience he did not dare at the time to 
say.   During the next weeks he looked over the situation. First 
of all there was the parsonage, an utterly impossible place for civilized 
people to live in, originally poorly conceived, apparently not 
repaired for years, with no plumbing or sewage, with rat-holes and rot. 
It was arranged that he would board in the home of one of the old 
members of the church, a woman named Catt who, as Wilson afterward found, 
was briefly referred to as The Cat because of her sharp tongue 
and fierce initiative.   Ann Catt was a lonely, devoted soul, 
never married, conducting a spotless home and devoted to her church, but 
a perpetual dissenter and born critic. She soared over the new pastor 
like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all 
the truth and gossip of which she was chief repository.   Then 
Wilson looked over the church and studied its condition. The salary 
of the pastor had for years been $500 annually and even this was in arrears. 
Wilson made up his mind that he must receive at least $2,500, 
but when he mentioned this to the Deacons they said nothing. The church 
itself must be repaired. It was dirty and neglected. It really 
ought to be rebuilt, and he determined to go up and talk to the city banks 
about this. Meanwhile, the city itself should be talked to. The 
streets in the colored section were dirty. There was typhoid and malaria. 
The children had nowhere to go and no place to play, not even sidewalks. 
The school was small, dark and ill-equipped. The teacher was 
a pliant fool. There were two liquor saloons not very far from the 
church, one white, that is conducted for white people with a side entrance 
for Negroes; the other exclusively Negro. Undoubtedly, there 
was a good deal of gambling in both.   On the other side of the 
church 
was a quiet, well-kept house with shutters and recently painted. Wilson 
inquired about it. It was called Kent House. The deacon of the 
church, Carlson, was its janitor. One of the leading members of the 
Amen corner was cook; there were two or three colored maids employed 
there. Wilson was told that it was a sort of hotel for white people, 
which seemed to him rather queer. Why should a white hotel be set 
down in the center of Black Bottom? But nevertheless it looked respectable. 
He was glad to have it there.   The rest of Black 
Bottom was a rabbit warren of homes in every condition of neglect, disrepair
