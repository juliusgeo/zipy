There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle: 
(1) Fence-line bunks- cattle eat from one side while feed 
is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons; 
(2) Mechanized bunks- they sit within the feed lot, are filled 
by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface; (3) Special bunks- 
as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides. Feed is 
put in with an elevator.   Several materials or combinations of 
materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk. The selection 
of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation, 
cost of materials available locally, and your own preference. No 
one material is best for all situations. Selecting bunks by economic 
comparison is usually an individual problem. 

#FENCE-LINE FEEDING.# 

Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk must be twice 
as long as the mechanical bunk. These bunks also serve as a fence, 
so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence. Because 
of their location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks are 
not in the way of mechanical manure removal. Filling these bunks by 
the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the 
wagons over more time and operations.   All-weather roads must 
be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all 
year. This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.

will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you
