look right through you while you were talking to him, and if you said, 
"For Christ's sake, Donald, you've got Prussian blue all 
over your shirt", he would smile, and nod, and an hour later the paint 
would be all over his pants as well. Mrs& Monmouth thought of 
him as her discovery, and she paid two to three hundred dollars for a 
painting. It was all gravy, and Donald didn't need much to live on; 
none of us did. We shared the expenses of the studio, and we all 
lived within walking distance of it, in cheap lodgings of one kind or 
another.   Attending the life class was my idea- or rather, Askington's 
idea, but I was ripe for it, and the other two wouldn't 
have gone if I hadn't talked them into it. I wanted to paint again. 
I hadn't done a serious picture in almost a year. It wasn't 
just the pressure of work, although that was the excuse I often used, 
even to myself. It was the kind of work I was doing, the quality of 
the ambition it awoke in me, that kept me from painting. I kept saying, 
"If I could just build up a reputation for myself, make some <real> 
money, get to be well known as an illustrator- like Peter Askington, 
for instance- then I could take some time off and paint". 
Askington was a kind of goal I set myself; I had admired him 
long before I talked to him. It looked to me as though he had everything 
an artist could want, joy in his work, standing in the profession, 
a large and steady income. The night we first met, at one of Mrs& 
Monmouth's giant parties, he was wearing a brown cashmere jacket 
with silver buttons and a soft pink Viyella shirt; instead of a necktie 
he wore a leather bolo drawn through a golden ring in which was set 
a lump of pale pure jade. This set his tone: richness of texture 
and color, and another kind of richness as well, for his clothing and 
decorations would have paid the Brush-off's rent for a year. He was 
fifteen years older than I- forty-four- but full of spring and 
sparkle. He didn't look like what I thought of as an old man, and 
his lively and erudite speech made him seem even younger. He was one 
of the most prominent magazine illustrators in America; you saw one 
of his paintings on the cover of one or another of the slick national 
magazines every month. <Life> had included him in its "Modern American 
Artists" series and had photographed him at his studio in 
the East Sixties; the corner of it you could see in the photograph 
looked as though it ought to have Velasquez in it painting the royalty 
of Spain.   I had a long talk with him. We went into Mrs& 
Monmouth's library, which had low bookshelves all along the walls, 
and above them a Modigliani portrait, a Jackson Pollock twelve feet 
long, and a gorgeous Miro with a yellow background, that looked like 
an inscription from a Martian tomb. The fireplace had tiles made 
for Mrs& Monmouth by Picasso himself. Like certain expensive restaurants, 
just sitting there gave you the illusion of being wealthy yourself.

In the course of our talk, Askington mentioned that he 
spent part of each week studying. "By yourself"? I asked. "No, 
I take classes with different people", he said. "I don't 
think I've reached the point, yet, where I can say I know everything 
I ought to know about the craft. Besides, it's important to the 
way a painter thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere, an 
atmosphere in which he may absorb the ideas of other masters, as Du^rer 
went to Italy to meet Bellini and Mantegna".   He made 
a circle with his thumb and fingers. "Painting isn't this big, 
you know. It doesn't embrace only the artist, alone before his easel. 
It is as large as all of art, interdependent, varied, multitudinous". 
He threw his arms wide, his face shining. "The artist is like 
a fragment of a mosaic- no, he is more than that, a virtuoso performer 
in some vast philharmonic. One of these days, I'm going to organize 
a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that's being 
painted these days, from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism, 
and then you'll be able to see at a glance how much artists 
have in common with each other. The eye is all, inward or outward. 
Ah, what a title for the exhibition: The Eye is All"!

"What do you study"? I asked. I was fascinated; just listening 
to him made me feel intelligent.   "I'm studying anatomy 
with Burns", he replied. "Maybe you know him. He teaches at 
the Manhattan School of Art". I nodded. I had studied with Burns 
ten years before, during the scholarship year the Manhattan gave me, 
along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for my paintings of bums on 
Hudson Street. Burns and I had not loved each other. "I'm also 
studying enameling with Hajime Iijima", he went on, "and twice 
a week I go to a life class taught by Pendleton".   "Osric 
Pendleton"? I said. "My God, is he still alive? He must 
be a million years old. I went to a retrospective of his work when 
I was eighteen, and I thought he was a contemporary of Cezanne's".

"Not quite". Askington laughed. "He's about sixty, 
now. Still painting, still a kind of modern impressionist, beautiful 
canvases of mountains and farms. He even makes the city look like 
one of Thoreau's hangouts. I've always admired him, and when I 
heard he was taking a few pupils, I went to him and joined his class".

"Yes, it sounds great", I said, "but suppose you 
don't think of yourself as an impressionist painter"?   "You're 
missing the point", he said. "He has the magical eye. And 
he is a great man. Contact with him is stimulating. And that's 
the trouble with so many artists today. They lack stimulation. They 
sit 
alone in their rooms and try to paint, and only succeed in isolating 
themselves still farther from life. That's one of the reasons art 
is becoming a useless occupation. In the Middle Ages, in the Renaissance, 
right up to the early nineteenth century, the painter was a giant 
in the world. He was an artisan, a man who studied his trade and 
developed his craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver did. 
He filled a real need, showing society what it looked like, turning 
it inside out, portraying its wars and its leaders, its ugliness and its 
beauties, reflecting its profound religious impulses. He was a propagandist- 
they weren't afraid of the word, then- satirist, nature 
lover, philosopher, scientist, what you will, a member of every party 
and of no party. But look at us today! We hold safe little jobs 
illustrating tooth-paste ads or the salacious incidents in trivial novels, 
and most of our easel painting is nothing but picking the fluff out 
of the navel so it can be contemplated in greater purity. A bunch 
of amateur dervishes! What we need is to get back to the group, to 
learning and apprenticeship, to the cafe and the school".   He 
could certainly talk. The upshot of the evening was that I got the 
address of Pendleton's studio- or rather, of the studio in which 
he gave his classes, for he didn't work there himself- and joined 
the life class, which met every Tuesday and Thursday from ten to twelve 
in the morning. It was an awkward hour, but I didn't have to 
punch any time clock, and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay 
a 
couple of hours later at the drawing board to finish up a job. After 
a short time, both George and Donald joined the class with me so they 
wouldn't feel lonely, and we used to hang a sign on the door of the 
Brush-off reading OUT TO WORK. It was mostly for the benefit of 
the mailman, because hardly anybody else ever visited us.   In 
a way, Askington was right. "Stimulating" was the word for it. 
I don't know that it was always as rewarding as I had expected it 
to be. Partly, it was because Pendleton himself wasn't what I anticipated. 
I had come prepared to worship at the feet of this classic, 
and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man who smelled of dead cigars.

No, that isn't quite fair. Actually, there was a lot 
of force in him, which is why I kept on in that class instead of quitting 
after a week.

SUCH a little thing to start with- the car registration.

"Ida, where is the car license"? she asked. "I can't 
find it in the glove compartment".   "Via must have it", 
I answered readily enough, recalling her last visit.   "Via", 
she was frowning. "Why should Via have it"?   Had 
she forgotten she had signed the car away, that whatever they mutually 
owned had been divided among the children?   I was silent. I 
didn't want to stir things up.   "I drive my own car by courtesy 
of Via"?   "I'm sure she'd turn it over to you, 
if you'd rather. You know that".   She looked as if she were 
accusing me of some fraud.   "She must have taken the registration 
when she went to Walter's. I'll call her".   "No, 
thank you. I want nothing of Via's".   Why should this 
suddenly assail her? Walter was giving me checks for my pay, the 
household bills. Had she been in such a turmoil that this had slipped 
her mind?   "What a fool I've been", she said quietly. 
"I knew all this, but I paid no attention. I don't even own the 
house I'm standing in. I was so sure it was all temporary **h that 
we would all embrace, and then the lawyer would tear up all those things 
**h   "It narrows down down down and finally there is no 
way out. If I am not to be Mrs& Salter I am nothing". 
I suppose I should have paid attention to that half-murmured remark, 
but it seemed one of those extreme statements women under stress indulge 
in. I love you, I hate you, I feel like killing you and myself, 
and in the same sequence I love you I think you're the most wonderful 
the most noble and so on and on, meanwhile eating a good breakfast 
and dinner and enjoying living. So I went about my business. I made 
a lemon sponge, a light dessert, roasted a chicken, parboiled some 
frozen vegetables, so there would be something nice in the icebox for 
the weekend. "Don't bother, Ida", she said. "I have these 
appointments in town for Saturday, and I'll probably spend Sunday 
with Dolly or the Thaxters".   At last, I thought, she's 
recovering her spirits. With this movie-to-be in London, and new faces 
about her there, she would soon be a more tranquil, a wiser person, 
all the better for her stay out here. I felt more cheerful, as if I 
had had a part in bringing her through to a greater tolerance of herself. 
And I went back to my own cottage to live my own little patch 
of life.   It was foggy that evening, but the path to my house was 
so well grooved that I could feel my way, accustomed as I was to 
the dense mists that rise from the sun-warmed palisades of the river 
and sometimes last for days. In the morning the fog was still thick 
so that to go to the village I crept along with my headlights full on.

I did notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the 
woods but as I had left a light on in my own house because of the 
fog I assumed Mrs& Salter had done the same before she left for 
town. I did my shopping, had my dentist appointment, and from there I 
went to the women's lunch at our parish church where we discussed 
plans for the annual Christmas bazaar, so that dusk was beginning to 
gather when I drove home in the late afternoon.   But the next 
day- Sunday. Why, when I drove down to church, didn't it speak 
to me, seeing the lights still on and the day crisp and clear? Prisoners 
brought to the dock accused of murder or accident say they cannot 
remember, and reading the accounts of their testimony you cannot believe 
that the mind can remove, absent itself, unsee. When I came back 
from church at noon Mrs& Thaxter was turning into the Salter driveway. 
Even at a car's length I could sense that something was wrong, 
and so I followed her up to the turnaround in front of the house.

Dolly Engisch was waiting there on the steps and she came 
running toward us.   "She's nowhere, nowhere"! she screamed, 
and both women ran up to the house, and I followed.   The 
search began, in all the rooms, running upstairs, down, opening closets, 
talking, exclaiming in rushes and gasps.   Everything was as 
I had left it the night before last- her portfolio and bag for town, 
her lingerie and dress and shoes laid out **h only her mink coat was 
missing. And she.   Then the telephoning began. I, who until 
that day before had been Mrs& Salter's friend, her equal, was the 
servant now. It was Dolly and Mrs& Thaxter who were calling Via,
