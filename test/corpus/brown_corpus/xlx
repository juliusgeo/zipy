spite of all the pitfalls, there is a certain amount of agreement on 
some of the giants. The anaconda proves to be the fly in the ointment, 
but the reason for this is not clear; the relatively wild conditions 
still found in tropical South America might be responsible.

There are three levels on which to treat the subject. The first is 
the strictly scientific, which demands concrete proof and therefore may 
err on the conservative side by waiting for evidence in the flesh. This 
approach rejects virtually all field measurements. The next level 
attempts to weigh varied evidence and come to a balanced, sensible conclusion; 
field measurements by experienced explorers are not rejected, 
and even reports of a less scientific nature are duly evaluated. 
The third level leans on a belief that a lot of smoke means some fire. 
The argument against this last approach is comparable to that which 
rejects stories about hoop snakes, about snakes that break themselves 
into many pieces and join up again, or even of ghosts that chase people 
out of graveyards; the mere piling up of testimony does not prove, 
to the scientific mind, the existence of hoop snakes, joint snakes, 
or ghosts.   Oliver has recently used the second-level approach 
with the largest snakes, and has come to these conclusions: the anaconda 
reaches a length of at least 37 feet, the reticulate python 33, 
the African rock python 25, the amethystine python at least 22, the Indian 
python 20, and the boa constrictor 18-1/2.   Bernard Heuvelmans 
also treats of the largest snakes, but on the third level, and 
is chiefly concerned with the anaconda. He reasons that as anacondas 
30 feet long are often found, some might be 38, and occasional "monstrous 
freaks" over 50. He rejects dimensions of 70 feet and more. 
His thirteenth chapter includes many exciting accounts of huge serpents 
with prodigious strength, but these seem to be given to complete his 
picture, not to be believed.   Detailed information on record 
lengths of the giants is given in the section that follows. 

#GROWTH 
OF THE SIX GIANTS#

Discussions of the giants one by one will include, 
as far as possible, data on these aspects of growth: size at which 
life is started and at which sexual maturity is reached; time required 
to reach maturity; rate of growth both before and after this crucial 
stage; and maximum length, with confirmation or amplification 
of Oliver's figures. Definite information on the growth of senile 
individuals is lacking. _ANACONDA:_ At birth, this species varies 
considerably in size. A brood of twenty-eight born at Brookfield 
Zoo, near Chicago, ranged in length from 22 to 33-1/2 inches and averaged 
29 inches. Lawrence E& Griffin gives measurements of nineteen 
young anacondas, presumably members of a brood, from "South America"; 
the extreme measurements of these fall between the lower limit 
of the Brookfield brood and its average. Raymond L& Ditmars 
had 
two broods that averaged 27 inches. R& R& Mole and F& W& 
Urich give approximately 20 inches as the average length of a brood 
of thirty from the region of the Orinoco estuaries. William Beebe 
reports 26 inches and 2.4 ounces (this snake must have been emaciated) 
for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from British Guiana. 
In contrast, Ditmars recorded the average length of seventy-two 
young of a 19-foot female as 38 inches, and four young were born in London 
at a length of 35 or 36 inches and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounces. 
Beebe had a 3-foot anaconda that weighed only 9.8 ounces. A difference 
between subspecies might explain the great range in size.

I have little information on the anaconda's rate of growth. Hans 
Schweizer had one that increased from 19-1/2 inches to 5 feet 3 inches 
in five years, and J& J& Quelch records a growth of from less 
than 4 feet to nearly 10 in about six years. It is very unlikely that 
either of these anacondas was growing at a normal rate.   In 1948, 
Afranio do Amaral, the noted Brazilian herpetologist, wrote a 
technical paper on the giant snakes. He concluded that the anaconda's 
maximum length is 12 or 13 (perhaps 14) meters, which would approximate 
from 39 to 42 feet (14 meters is slightly less that 46 feet). Thus, 
his estimate lies between Oliver's suggestion of at least 37 feet 
and the 50-foot "monstrous freaks" intimated by Heuvelmans.

The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda was made in 
eastern Colombia by Roberto Lamon, a petroleum geologist of the Richmond 
Oil Company, and reported in 1944 by Emmett R& Dunn. However, 
as a field measurement, it is open to question. Oliver's 37-1/2 
feet is partly based on this report and can be accepted as probable. 
However, many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer 
a tentative maximum of about 30 feet.   It is possible that especially 
large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limited to 
a small area. In snakes difference in size is a common characteristic 
of subspecies. _BOA CONSTRICTOR:_ A Colombian female's brood 
of sixteen boa constrictors born in the Staten Island Zoo averaged 
20 inches. This birth length seems to be typical. When some thirteen 
records of newly and recently born individuals are collated, little 
or no correlation between length and distribution can be detected. The 
range is from 14 to 25 inches; the former figure is based on a somewhat 
unusual birth of four by a Central American female (see chapter 
on Laying, Brooding, Hatching, and Birth), the latter on a "normal" 
newly born individual. However, as so many of the records are 
not certainly based on newborn snakes, these data must be taken tentatively; 
final conclusions will have to await the measurements of broods 
from definite localities.   Alphonse R& Hoge's measurements 
of several very young specimens from Brazil suggest that at birth the 
female is slightly larger than the male.   I have surprisingly little 
information on the size and age at maturity. Carl Kauffeld has 
written to me of sexual activity in February 1943 of young born in March 
1940. One female, collected on an island off the coast of Nicaragua, 
was gravid and measured 4 feet 8 inches from <snout to vent> 
(her tail should be between 6 and 7 inches long). The female from Central 
America which gave birth to four was only 3 feet 11 inches long.

What data there are on growth indicate considerable variation 
in rate; unfortunately, no one has kept complete records of one individual, 
whereas many have been made for a very short period of time. 
The results are too varied to allow generalization. 
The bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close 
relationship throughout. The pulmonary vein, however, without the limiting 
supportive tissue septa as in type /1,, follows a more direct 
path 
to the hilum and does not maintain this close relationship (figs& 8, 
22). Another marked difference is noted here. The pulmonary artery, 
in addition to supplying the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole, 
the alveolar duct, and the alveoli, continues on and directly supplies 
the thin pleura (fig& 8). The bronchial artery, except for a 
small number of short branches in the hilum, contributes none of the 
pleural blood supply. It does, as in type /1,, supply the hilar lymph 
nodes, the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary vein, the bronchi, and the 
bronchioles- terminating in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary 
artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole. No bronchial artery-pulmonary 
artery anastomoses were noted in this group.   Lung 
type /3, (fig& 3) is to some degree a composite of types /1, 
and /2,. It is characterized by the presence of incompletely developed 
secondary lobules; well defined, but haphazardly arranged, interlobular 
septa and a thick, remarkably vascular pleura (fig& 9). The 
most distal airways are similar to those found in type /1,, being 
composed of numerous, apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional, 
poorly developed respiratory bronchioles (figs& 14, 15). In this 
instance, because of incomplete septation, the secondary lobule does 
not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung 
as in type /1,. Air-drifts from one area to another are, therefore, 
conceivable. Distally the bronchus is situated between a pulmonary artery 
on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other, as in type /1, 
(fig& 24). This relationship, however, is not maintained centrally. 
Here the pulmonary vein, as in type /2,, is noted to draw away from 
the bronchus, and to follow a more direct, independent course to the 
hilum (figs& 23, 24). The bronchial artery in its course and distribution 
differs somewhat from that found in other mammals. As seen in 
types /1, and /2,, it supplies the hilar lymph nodes, vasa vasorum 
to the pulmonary artery and vein, the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles. 
As in type /1,, it provides arterial blood to the interlobular 
septa, and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply is seen (figs& 
9, 10). This pleural supply is derived both from hilar and interlobular 
bronchial artery branches. Such a dual derivation was strikingly 
demonstrated during the injection process where initial filling 
would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels at once. Some 
of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches of the 
bronchial arteries while others were filling from direct hilar branches 
following along the pleural surface. With completion of filling, net-like 
anastomoses were noted to be present between these separately 
derived branches. An unusual increase in the number of bronchial arteries 
present within the substance of the lung was noted. This was accounted 
for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely following 
the pulmonary artery. The diameter of this bronchial artery was 
much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum (figs& 16, 23, 24). 
In distal regions its diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that 
of the pulmonary artery. This vessel could be followed to the parenchyma 
where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar 
capillary bed (figs& 17, 18). Also three other direct pathways 
of alveolar bronchial arterial supply were noted: via the pleura; 
through the interlobular septa; and along the terminal bronchiole (figs& 
14, 17, 18, 19). One bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar 
anastomosis was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level (fig& 26). 

#DISCUSSION#

It is evident that many marked and striking differences 
exist between lungs when an inter-species comparison is made. The 
significance of these differences has not been studied nor has the existence 
of corresponding physiologic differences been determined. However, 
the dynamics of airflow, from morphologic considerations alone, 
may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse. The volume 
and, perhaps, even the characteristics of bronchial arterial blood 
flow might be different in the dog than in the horse. Also, interlobular 
air drifts may be all but nonexistent in the cow; probably occur 
in the horse much as in the human being; and, in contrast are present 
to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where 
lobules are absent (Van Allen and Lindskog, '31). A reason 
for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology is entirely lacking 
at present.   Within certain wide limits anatomy dictates function 
and, if one is permitted to speculate, potential pathology should 
be included in this statement as well. For example, the marked susceptibility 
of the monkey to respiratory infection might be related to its 
delicate, long alveolar ducts and short, large bronchioles situated 
within a parenchyma entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue 
barriers such as those found in types /1, and /3,. One might also 
wonder if monkeys are capable of developing bronchiolitis as we know 
it in man or the horse. In addition, it would be difficult to imagine 
chronic generalized emphysema occurring in a cow, considering its marked 
lobular development but, conversely, not difficult to imagine this 
occurring in the horse or the dog.   Anatomically, the horse lung 
appears to be remarkably like that of man, insofar as this can be ascertained 
from comparison of our findings in the horse with those of 
others (Birnbaum, '54) in the human being. The only area in which 
one might find major disagreement in this matter is in regard to the alveolar 
distribution of the bronchial arteries. As early as 1858, Le 
Fort claimed an alveolar distribution of the bronchial arteries in human 
beings. In 1951, this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz. The opposition 
to this point of view has its staunchest support in the work of Miller 
('50). Apparently, however, Miller has relied heavily on the
