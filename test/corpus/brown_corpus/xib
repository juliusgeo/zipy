stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water; the mill-pond 
is quiet, its surface dark and shadowed, and there does not seem to 
be much water in it. Time in the sum is nothing. And yet- a year to 
a child is an eternity, and in the memory that phase of one's being- 
a certain mental landscape- will seem to have endured without beginning 
and without end. The part of the mind that preserves dates and 
events may remonstrate, "It could have been like that for only a 
little while"; but true memory does not count nor add: it holds 
fast to things that were and they are outside of time.   Once, 
then- for how many years or how few does not matter- my world was 
bound round by fences, when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough, 
to twist my knee over it and pull myself up. That world was in 
scale with my own smallness. I have no picture in my mind of the garden 
as a whole- that I could not see- but certain aspects of certain 
corners linger in the memory: wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums 
beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their 
sharp scent of November; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned 
over by a dusty-slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked 
in the ragged, brown-edged holes; hot-colored verbenas in the corner 
between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on 
our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother 
for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.   It was 
mother who planted the verbenas. I think that my grandmother was not 
an impassioned gardener: she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and 
grandchildren. My great-grandmother, I have been told, made her garden 
her great pride; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders 
in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to 
be wintered in the cellar; she filled the waste spots of the yard with 
common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed, 
and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house. These my 
grandmother left in their places (they are still there, more persistent 
and longer-lived than the generations of man) and planted others like 
them, that flourished without careful tending. Three of these only 
were protected from us by stern commandment: the roses, whose petals 
might not be collected until they had fallen, to be made into perfume 
or rose-tea to drink; the peonies, whose tight sticky buds would 
be blighted by the laying on of a finger, although they were not apparently 
harmed by the ants that crawled over them; and the poppies. I 
have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer 
morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than 
my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap, unfolded, and shook out 
like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals. Other flowers 
we might gather as we pleased: myrtle and white violets from beneath 
the lilacs; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so prodigally but 
for the most part beyond our reach; snowballs; hollyhock blossoms 
that, 
turned upside down, make pink-petticoated ladies; and the little, 
dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.   More 
potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a 
few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae 
which are of the very stuff of the mind, intrinsic, because they 
were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that 
held them. Flowers, stones, and small creatures, living and dead. Pale 
yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite; seed-pods 
of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch; red-and-yellow 
columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and 
eaten 
for the honey in them; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped 
and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag; bright flowers 
from the trumpet vine that made "gloves" on the ends of ten 
waggling fingers. Fuzzy caterpillars, snails with their sensitive horns, 
struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded 
to "spit tobacco, spit". Dead fledgling birds, their squashed-looking 
nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they 
had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags. And 
the 
cast shell of a locust, straw-colored and transparent, weighing nothing, 
fragile but entire, with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down 
its back. Every morning early, in the summer, we searched the trunks 
of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells, carefully 
detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung, and stabled 
them, a weird faery herd, in an angle between the high roots of the 
tulip tree, where no grass grew in the dense shade **h. We collected 
"lucky stones"- all the creamy translucent pebbles, worn smooth 
and round, that we could find in the driveway. When these had been 
pocketed, we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles 
for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their 
dull exteriors indicated. We showed them to each other and said "Would 
you have guessed **h"? Squatting on our haunches beside the 
flat stone we broke them on, we were safe behind the high closed gates 
at the end of the drive: safe from interruption and the observation 
and possible amusement of the passers-by. Thus shielded, we played 
many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness; even when the 
fences became a part of the game- when a vine-embowered gate-post 
was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let 
down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire, even then we paid 
little heed to those who went by on the path outside.   We enjoyed 
a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school. In 
the heat of the summer, the garden solitudes were ours alone; our 
elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch. They 
never troubled themselves about us while we were playing, because 
the fence formed such a definite boundary and "Don't go outside 
the gate" was a command so impossible of misinterpretation. We were 
not, however, entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street. 
We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they sag on their 
hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but we could stand on them, when they 
were latched, rest our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing 
to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that lay before 
our eyes.   The street that is full now of traffic and parked 
cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade 
of the curbside trees, and silence was a weight, almost palpable, 
in the air. Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell 
away again, crushed beneath it. A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter, 
the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees, and loose 
straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves. A wheel squeaked 
on a hub, was still, and squeaked again. If a child watched its progress 
he whispered, "Hay, hay, load of hay- make a wish and turn 
away", and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the 
sound of the horses' feet returned no more. When the hay wagon had 
gone, and an interval passed, a huckster's cart might turn the corner. 
The horse walked, the reins were slack, the huckster rode with bowed 
shoulders, his forearms across his knees. Sleepily, as if half-reluctant 
to break the silence, he lifted his voice: "Rhu-beb-ni-ice 
fresh rhu-<beb> today"! The lazy sing-song was spaced in time 
like the drone of a bumble-bee. No one seemed to hear him, no one heeded. 
The horse plodded on, and he repeated his call. It became so monotonous 
as to seem a part of the quietness. After his passage, the street 
was empty again. The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down; 
the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk, from sidewalk 
to lawn. At four-o'clock, or four-thirty, the coming of the newsboy 
marked the end of the day; he tossed a paper toward every front 
door, and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read 
what their neighbors had been doing.   The streets of any county 
town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer; they were 
like this fifty-odd years ago, and yesterday. But the fences were still 
in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we stood on the gate to look 
over, the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving 
stones with grass between and on both sides. The curb was a line 
of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost 
in the ground or the roots of trees. Opposite every gate was a hitching 
post or a stone carriage-step, set with a rusty iron ring for tying 
a horse. The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center; 
it was mud in wet weather and dust, ankle-deep, in dry, and could 
be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones. It had 
a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since. The hoofmarks of 
cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as 
numerous as the traces of shod horses. Cows were kept in backyard barns, 
boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge 
of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys' 
coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.

It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story, 
because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and 
makes of them a curious, riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant 
for Mann's work.   The wife, Amra, and her lover are 
both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, "voluptuous" 
and "indolent", possibly "a mischief maker", with "a kind 
of luxurious cunning" to set against her apparent simplicity, her "birdlike 
brain". La^utner, for his part, "belonged to the present-day 
race of small artists, who do not demand the utmost of themselves", 
and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets 
as "wretched little poseurs", the devastating indictment "they 
do not know how to be wretched decently and in order", and the somewhat 
extreme prophecy, so far not fulfilled: "They will be destroyed".

The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want 
not simply of decency but of imagination as well. His appearance as 
Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience; it is a spectacle 
absolutely painful, an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed 
by spirit, untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation. 
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved- the fat 
man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending to be a baby- touches 
for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's, 
upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human 
life.   The music which La^utner has composed for this episode 
is for the most part "rather pretty and perfectly banal". But 
it is characteristic of him, we are told, "his little artifice", 
to be able to introduce "into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of 
hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art". And this occurs 
now, at the refrain of Jacoby's song- at the point, in fact, of 
the name "Lizzy"-; a modulation described as "almost a stroke 
of genius". "A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly 
torn away to reveal something nude". It is this modulation 
which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously, 
his wife's infidelity. By the same means he perceives this fact 
as having communicated itself to the audience; he collapses, and dies.

In the work of every artist, I suppose, there may be found 
one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive, 
ultimately emblematic of what it is all about; not less strikingly 
so for being mysterious, as though some deeply hidden constatation of 
thoughts were enciphered in a single image, a single moment. So here. 
The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke 
gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore 
dressing up as a baby; the epiphany of that quivering flesh; the 
bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, 
mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional 
touch of genius (which, however, does not know "how to attack 
the problem of suffering"); the miraculous way in which music, revelation 
and death are associated in a single instant- all this seems 
a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself; beyond itself, 
also, 
it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's 
work.   When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that 
this passage is of critical significance, I come up with the following 
ideas, which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in 
a later essay.   Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's 
heroes. The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically 
turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled 
and forbidden to love. The release, the freedom, involved in loving
