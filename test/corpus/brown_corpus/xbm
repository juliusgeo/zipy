"Alba Madonna" and "texture" in a Monet painting of Rheims 
Cathedral. Everybody had heard of Van Gogh, the French impressionist.

Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group, standing 
on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them. 
He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery "is 
the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director 
**h Richard Bales **h I'm sure you've heard af him **h and his 
record, 'The Confederacy'".   Along with the gallery aide 
who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group, went 
one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.   In 45 minutes, 
the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art 
from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century.   A few of them 
said they "preferred contemporary art".   Among the other 
artists, whose paintings were discussed were Boucher, Courbet, Fra 
Angelico.   The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most 
was the Gallery's rotunda fountain **h "because it's on the 
second floor".

That imposing, somewhat austere, and seemingly remote collonaded 
building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th st& 
nw& took on bustling life yesterday.   More than 250 Scottish 
Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple 
to pay tribute to their most prominent leader, Albert Pike, who headed 
the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.   They came together in 
the huge, high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized. 
C& Wheeler Barnes of Denver, head of the Scottish Rite 
in Colorado, praised Pike as a historian, author, poet, journalist, 
lawyer, jurist, soldier and musician, who devoted most of his mature 
years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order.   The ceremony 
ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House 
of the Temple. A reception and tea followed.   About 1500 
delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the 
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction 
of the United States.   The opening session of the 5-day session 
will begin at 10 a& m& today. There will be a pilgrimage to 
Mount Vernon at 2:30 p& m&. A wreath will be placed at the 
tomb of George Washington, one of this Nation's first Masons- 
a past master of Washington-Alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria.

THE MARRIAGE of John and Mary Black had clearly reached 
the breaking point after eight years.   John had a job in a small 
firm where the work was dull and monotonous. He would come home in 
the evening tired and discouraged- in no frame of mind to play with 
their three children, or spend much time chatting with his wife.

Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary complained often 
that he didn't help around the house, and that he didn't really 
care about the family. She accused him of ignoring her. He in turn told 
her she demanded too much. They were both discouraged, disgusted 
and miserable.   Mary decided she had had enough. Without any definite 
plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could be done. The 
judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations- 
then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from 
Family 
Service before going to a lawyer.   Family Service, sharing 
in ~UGF, has five agencies in the Washington area. They offer 
to the people of this community case work service and counseling on 
a wide variety of family problems.   Because neither of them really 
wanted their marriage to break up, Mr& and Mrs& Black agreed 
to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia, 
the agency nearest them. For nearly a year, they have been receiving 
counseling, separately and together, in an effort to understand and 
overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce. 
The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of 
the problems confronting the other. They are now working together toward 
solving their difficulties.   JOHN received a promotion 
in his firm. He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on 
life. Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings, 
and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session 
of happy, family rough-housing.   To outsiders, the Blacks seem 
to be an ordinary, happy family, and they are- but with a difference. 
They know the value of being just that- an ordinary, happy family.

Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this 
area. Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital. But 
to the families it serves, their help cannot be measured. Family Service 
could not open its doors to a single family without the financial 
support of the United Givers Fund.

Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to 
materialize yesterday, park rangers said, and those who made the trip 
got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze. 

#FOR CRUCIAL ENCOUNTER#

One of the initial questions put to President 
Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his 
attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev. Mr& Kennedy 
replied:   @ "I'm hopeful that from @ more traditional 
exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground".   The 
President knew that a confrontation with Mr& Khrushchev sooner or 
later probably was inevitable and even desirable. But he was convinced 
that the realities of power- military, economic and ideological- 
were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that 
these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting. He 
wanted to buy time to strengthen the U& S& and its allies and 
to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.   Last Friday 
the White House announced:   President Kennedy will 
meet 
with Soviet Premier Nikita S& Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 
4.   The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration 
in East-West relations. The heightened tension, in fact, had been 
a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency 
of a meeting with the Soviet leader. He was not going to Vienna 
to negotiate- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow 
last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned. But 
Mr& Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with 
Mr& Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.

That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting. 
Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance 
of the meeting, it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters 
of the cold war. @ 

#ROAD TO VIENNA#

The U& S& and 
Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston 
Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy 
with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace "at the 
summit of the nations".   The first time was in 1955 when a 
full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the "spirit of Geneva". 
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads 
into the Middle East.   In 1959 President Eisenhower 
and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U& S&. 
That meeting produced the "spirit of Camp David"- a spirit, it 
later turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress 
toward a Berlin settlement.   On the third occasion- another 
Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago- there was no problem 
of an illusory "spirit". Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference 
at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U& S& 
for the ~U-2 incident. The episode tended to confirm the U& 
S& belief that propaganda, the hope of one-sided concessions, and 
the chance to split the Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were 
the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry. 

#PRE-INAUGURAL POSITION# 

Thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration 
that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President, Mr& 
Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem. Shortly before his 
nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations 
with the Soviet leader in these words:   "As long 
as Mr& Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is 
shifting his way, no amount of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp 
David talks nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful 
negotiations".

The President had set for himself the task, which 
he believed vital, of awakening the U& S& and its allies to 
the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance. He did 
not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make 
it unnecessary. He wanted time, too, to review the United States' 
global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited 
and new ones he was formulating. Above all, he did not want to appear 
to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep. 

#ATTITUDE 
FLEXIBLE#

At the same time the President took pains not to 
rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader. Ideally, he knew, 
it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels. But Mr& 
Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting, provided that undue 
hopes were not raised in connection with it. It would give him an 
opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war, 
to try to probe Mr& Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear 
his own views. Moreover, an eventual meeting was desirable if for no 
other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U& S& was not 
inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.

Both elements- the caution about a meeting, the willingness 
eventually to hold one- were reflected in a letter from the President 
which Ambassador Llewellyn E& Thompson brought back to Russia 
late in February. The letter, dated Feb& 22, was delivered to 
Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9. It dealt 
mainly with a broad range of East-West issues. But it also briefly 
suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr& Khrushchev before 
the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and 
schedules permitted.   Developments over the next two months, however, 
caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing. 
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House 
about the advisability of an early meeting, not because the international 
climate was improving, but precisely because it was deteriorating 
alarmingly. 

#DEADLOCK ON TESTS#

The President was especially 
concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at 
Geneva. The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand 
for a three-man (East, West and neutral) directorate, and thus a veto, 
over the control machinery. In the U& S&, strong pressures 
have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians 
may be secretly testing.   Mr& Kennedy was less troubled 
by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown, 
or even continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear 
weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament. 
There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was
