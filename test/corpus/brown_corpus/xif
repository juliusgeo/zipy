me. That little spark is all the wealth I know, That little spark 
is my life's misery". A dominant motive is the poet's longing 
for his homeland and its boyhood associations: "Not men-folk, but 
the fields where I would stray, The stones where as a child I used 
to play". He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory 
life he has been leading. What he really wants is to find "a 
sacred cause" to which he can honestly devote himself. This restless 
individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all 
the rest of his life in Sweden. His cause was to commemorate the glory 
of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.

He did not, however, find himself at once. His next major 
work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic epic in prose, entitled 
<Hans Alienus,> which Professor Bo^o^k describes as a monument 
on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth. The hero, who is 
himself, is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East, 
a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from Professor Bo^o^k again, 
"even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from 
his painful search after the meaning of life. He is driven back by 
his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of 
Tiveden".   From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his 
deeper self. By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession 
of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions. He 
did not, however, settle back into acquiescence with things as they were. 
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little 
patience with collective mediocrity. He saw Sweden as a country of 
smug and narrow provincialism, indifferent to the heroic spirit of its 
former glory. Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear 
down the old structures and build anew from the ground up. Heidenstam's 
conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories 
of the past. ##

Whether in prose or poetry, all of Heidenstam's 
later work was concerned with Sweden. With the first of a group 
of historical novels, <The Charles Men (Karolinerna)>, published 
in 1897-8, he achieved the masterpiece of his career. In scope 
and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's <War and Peace>. 
About one-third as long, it is less intimate and detailed, but better 
coordinated, more concise and more dramatic. Though it centers around 
the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles /12,, the true hero 
is not finally the king himself. Hence the title of the book, referring 
to the soldiers and subjects of the king; on the fatal battlefield 
of Poltava, to quote from the novel, "the wreath he twined for 
himself slipped down upon his people".   <The Charles Men> 
consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories, 
each depicting a special phase of the general subject. Somewhat uneven 
in interest for an average reader, eight or ten of these are among 
the finest of their kind in literature. They comprise a great variety 
of scene and interest: grim episodes of war, idyllic interludes, superb 
canvases of world-shaking events, and delightfully humorous sketches 
of odd characters. The general effect is tragic. Almost nothing 
is said of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme being 
the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune 
and defeat.   To carry out this exalted conception the 
author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed 
in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale. His 
peculiar gift, as had been suggested before, is his intensity. George 
Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style. Of few authors 
is this more true than of Heidenstam. <The Charles Men> has a tremendous 
range of characters, of common folk even more than of major 
figures. The career of Charles /12, is obviously very similar to that 
of Napoleon. His ideal was Alexander of Macedon, as Napoleon's 
was Julius Caesar. His purpose, however, was not to establish an 
empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice. Each aspired 
to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god. 
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought 
ruin on the country that worshipped him. Each is still glorified 
as a national hero.   The first half of <The Charles Men,> 
ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709, is more dramatically 
coherent than the second. After the collapse of that desperate 
and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a 
time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous. 
Like Napoleon, he was the worst of losers. There are, however, some 
wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part, concerning 
the reactions of the Swedes in adversity. Then more than ever before 
did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness. This comes 
out in "When the Bells Ring", which describes the rallying of the 
peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.

In "The King's Ride", Charles breaks out of a long period 
of petulance and inertia, regains his old self, escapes from Turkey, 
and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years. 
He finds it in utter misery and desolation. All his people ask for 
is no more war. But he plunges into yet another, this time with Norway, 
and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall, being 
only thirty-six years of age when he died. He had become king at fifteen.

Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular 
feeling. From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol 
of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden. This is 
brought out in the next to last chapter of the book, "A Hero's 
Funeral", written in the form of an impassioned prose poem. Slowly 
the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside 
the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral, the shrine 
of so many precious memories. The guns are fired, the hymns are 
sung, and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside 
the tombs of his ancestors. As he had longed to be, he became the 
echo of a saga.   Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction 
about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory. Excellent in their 
way, they lack the wide appeal of <The Charles Men>, and need 
not detain us here. It is different with his volume <The Swedes 
and Their Chieftains (Svenskarna och deras ho^vdingar),> a history 
intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high 
school students. Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to Swedish 
history for readers of other countries. Some of the earlier episodes 
have touches of the supernatural, as suited to the legendary background. 
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlo^f. Especially touching 
is the chapter, "The Little Sister", about a king's daughter 
who became a nun in the convent of St& Birgitta. The record 
teems with romance and adventure. Gustaf Vasa is a superb example, 
and Charles /10,, the conqueror of Denmark, hardly less so. Of 
Gustavus Adolphus and Charles /12, it is unnecessary to speak. 
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or 
handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always 
been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with 
those who have not. It is from this unpromising background that the 
fictional private detective was recruited. ##

THE mythological 
private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential 
ways. On the one hand, he does not work for a large agency, but 
is almost always self-employed. As a free-lance investigator, the fictional 
detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client. 
For this reason, he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure, 
whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 
9 to 5 routine. On the other hand, the fictional detective does not 
break strikes or handle divorce cases; no client would ever think of 
asking him to do such things. Whatever his original assignment, the 
fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime, usually 
a murder. Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in 
name, he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police 
themselves. He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to 
do so (frequently he does not receive a fee at all), but because he enjoys 
his work, because he firmly believes that murder must be punished. 
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman. 
He is, first and foremost, a defender of public morals, a servant of 
society.   It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and 
public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological 
detective. By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and 
his freedom from external restraint, the private eye is a perfect embodiment 
of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing 
what you please and let the devil take the hindmost. At the same time, 
because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal 
dictates of his society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is 
in middle class eyes a virtuous man. In this way, the private detective 
gets the best of two possible worlds. He is an individualist but 
not an anarchist; he is a public servant but not a cop. In short, the 
fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's 
ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere 
promote the public welfare. In the mystery story, as in <The 
Wealth of Nations,> individualism and the social good are two sides 
of the same benevolent coin. ##

THERE is only one 
catch to this idyllic arrangement: Adam Smith was wrong. Not only 
did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest 
number, he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to monopoly 
capitalism. The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe 
and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900. Now, although 
the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far 
as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades 
of the 19th century that the private detective became an established 
figure in popular fiction. Sherlock Holmes, the ancestor of all private 
eyes, was born during the 1890s. Thus the transformation of Adam 
Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides 
closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life. Driven 
from the marketplace by the course of history, our hero disguises 
himself as a private detective. The birth of the myth compensates 
for the death of the ideal.   Even on the fictional level, however, 
the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully 
resolved. The individualism and public service of the private detective 
both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct: 
he enforces the law without being told to do so. The private eye is therefore 
a moral man; but his morality rests upon that of his society. 
The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between 
good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal. 
Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold good. As 
capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon 
force and violence for its survival, the private detective is placed 
in a serious dilemma. If he is good, he may not be legal; if he is 
legal, he may not be good. It is the gradual unfolding and deepening 
of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution 
of the mystery story. ##

WITH the advent of Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the development of the modern private 
detective begins. Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist; 
he is very close to being a mental case. A brief list of the great 
detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr& Freud with 
ample food for thought. Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and 
other refreshing stimulants; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances 
induced by the playing of the vioiln; he is a recluse, an incredible 
egotist, a confirmed misogynist. Holmes rebels against the social 
conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds. His 
eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom. It was in order 
to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became 
a detective in the first place. As he informs Watson, "My life is 
spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. 
These little problems help me to do so". Holmes is a public servant, 
to be sure; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.
