into the Inland Sea; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and 
boats in Osaka Bay. A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 
washed away an entire town (Ponoluu), leaving only two forlorn trees 
standing where the community had been. In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 
27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes.   The dimensions 
of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement. An ordinary 
sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to 
crest- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the 
Pacific. But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes 
as much as 600 miles from crest to crest. While a wind wave never 
travels at more than 60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in 
the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour. The greater 
the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave; 
Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of 
the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity. In 
the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles 
per hour.   Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length 
that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable. Their amplitude 
sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest. Usually it 
is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build 
up to their terrifying heights. On the fateful day in 1896 when the 
great waves approached Japan, fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells. 
Not until they sailed home at the end of the day, through a sea 
strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware of what 
had happened. The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water 
from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning 
thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.   The 
giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones. They 
usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into 
a ~V-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.

Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell, 
not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers. 
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore 
as the first great trough arrives. Reefs are left high and dry, and 
the beaches are covered with stranded fish. At Hilo large numbers 
of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach. 
Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for some 
minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore. After an earthquake 
in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified 
by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher 
ground. When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach, 
fearing that they might be buried under landslides. Just as they reached 
the shore, the first huge wave crashed upon them.   A tsunami 
is not a single wave but a series. The waves are separated by intervals 
of 15 minutes to an hour or more (because of their great length), 
and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great 
wave has crashed that it is all over. The waves may keep coming for many 
hours. Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the 
biggest.   Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was 
Francis P& Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 
one of the world's foremost marine geologists. He was able to make 
a detailed inspection of the waves. Their onrush and retreat, he reported, 
was accompanied by a great hissing, roaring and rattling. The 
third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest. On some of the islands' 
beaches the waves came in gently; they were steepest on the 
shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come. 
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high. The highest waves, 
55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.   Scientists and fishermen 
have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon. During 
a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night. The 
luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the 
stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism <Noctiluca miliaris> 
by the turbulence of the sea. Japanese fishermen have sometimes 
observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have 
enormously swollen stomachs; the fish have swallowed vast numbers 
of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance. The 
waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and 
battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth 
of 3,000 feet. Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.

The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in 
Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised 
by Commander C& K& Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff. 
It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber 
which record the rise and fall of the water surface. Ordinary water 
tides are disregarded. But when waves with a period of between 10 and 
40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding 
oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit. 
This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the 
station that a tsunami is in progress. Such equipment has been installed 
at Hilo, Midway, Attu and Dutch Harbor. The moment the alarm 
goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which 
is the center of the warning system.   This center also receives 
prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the 
Pacific which are equipped with seismographs. Its staff makes a preliminary 
determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide 
stations near the epicenter for a tsunami. By means of charts showing 
wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is 
possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival 
at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific. 
The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger, 
and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps. All 
of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system, 
and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work 
smoothly.   Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami 
in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence. On November 4, 
1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula. 
At 17:07 that afternoon (Greenwich time) the shock was recorded 
by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu. The warning system immediately 
went into action. Within about an hour with the help of reports 
from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and California, the quake's 
epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees 
East longitude. While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came 
in from various points in the Pacific (Midway reported it was covered 
with nine feet of water), the Hawaiian station made its calculations 
and notified the military services and the police that the first big 
wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.   It 
turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946. They hurled a 
cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone 
lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows. 
But not a single human life was lost, and property damage in the Hawaiian 
Islands did not exceed $800,000. There is little doubt that the 
warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.   But it is 
plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough. In the 
vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against 
building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they 
be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.

The key to the world of geology is change; nothing remains the 
same. Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the 
sea to complex combinations in man. The land, too, is changing, and 
earthquakes are daily reminders of this. Earthquakes result when movements 
in the earth twist rocks until they break. Sometimes this is accompanied 
by visible shifts of the ground surface; often the shifts 
cannot be seen, but they are there; and everywhere can be found scars 
of earlier breaks once deeply buried. Today's earthquakes are most 
numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated, 
but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth 
that has not had them.   The effects of earthquakes on civilization 
have been widely publicized, even overemphasized. The role of 
an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously 
frightening, but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular 
disaster. Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.

We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know 
about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth 
which emerge with information about the materials through which they 
have traveled. These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface 
a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.

Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface, 
but they do not occur at greater depths. Two unsolved mysteries are 
based on these facts. (1) As far down as 400 miles below the surface 
the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to 
twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface 
rocks do. (2) If earthquakes do occur at such depths, why not deeper?

Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been 
applied in various fields. In the search for oil and gas, we make 
similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from 
them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation 
of these resources. We have also developed techniques for recognizing 
and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the 
ground which they generate.   The following discussion of this subject 
has been adapted from the book {Causes of Catastrophe} by 
L& Don Leet. 

#THE RESTLESS EARTH AND ITS INTERIOR#

<At twelve 
minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday>, April 18, 1906, 
San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake. A sharp tremor 
was followed by a jerky roll.

{IN} Ireland's County Limerick, near the River 
Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which 
means "Garden of Owen". Undoubtedly none of the residents realize 
the influence their town has had on American military history, 
or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name. The cry "Garryowen"! 
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was 
the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes, 
Sioux and Apaches, Mexican <banditos> under Pancho Villa, Japanese 
in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists 
in Korea. Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U& S& Cavalry 
Regiment, "The Fighting Seventh".   Today a battle 
cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, <esprit de corps> 
has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables. But don't 
tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a 
saloon on Saturday night.   Of all the thousands of men who have 
served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than 
Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C& Chandler. Wiry and burr-headed, 
with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler 
is the epitome of the old-time trooper. The truth is, however, that 
when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he 
had ever ridden 
was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded 
was a pencil.   Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical 
Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas 
City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make 
the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it. Though 
he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other 
desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces. The 
next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer 
of Troop ~H, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.

Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher 
spot. First of all, no unit likes to have a new ~CO brought in from 
the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper. Second,
