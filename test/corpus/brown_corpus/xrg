as well wait here while I'm gone, so you can use my shower if you'd 
like".   "Oh, I'd love to". I showed her the shower 
and tub, and she said, smiling, "If you really don't mind, I think 
I'll get clean in the shower, then soak for a few minutes in your 
tub. That always relaxes me. Doesn't it you"?   "Only 
when I do it". I shook my head. One of my virtues or vices is 
a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and 
glorious living color. "Soak **h as long as you want, Joyce. It'll 
probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with 
you. So you'll have everything all to yourself, doggone **h"

I looked at my watch. Ten after nine. Time to go, I supposed. 
"Well, goodbye", I said.   "Goodbye. You'd better hurry".

"Oh, you can count on that".   She smiled slightly. 
Softly. Warmly. "Don't hurry <too> much. I'll be soaking 
for **h at least half an hour".   That was all she said. 
But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms 
of bees in them. However, when there's a job to be done, I'm 
a monstrosity of grim determination, I like to think. I spun about 
and clattered through the front room to the door. As I went out, I 
could hear water pouring in the shower. Hot water. She wouldn't be 
taking a cold shower. Hell, she couldn't.   Bryn Mawr Drive 
is only two or three miles from the Spartan, and it took me less than 
five minutes to get there. But the scene was not the quiet, calm scene 
I'd expected. Four cars were parked at the curb, and two of them 
were police radio cars. Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding 
grounds. I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the 
house to the pool. Two uniformed officers, a couple of plain-clothesmen 
I knew, and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the 
pool on my left. At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce 
had mentioned, and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender 
patches of limp-looking lather. A few yards beyond the group of men, 
a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra.

Lieutenant Rawlins, one of the plain-clothesmen, spotted 
me and said, "Hi, Shell", and walked toward me. "How'd you 
hear about this one"? I grinned, but ignored the question. He didn't 
push it; Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd 
been friends for years.   He filled me in. A call to the police 
had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine p&m&, 
and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that- 
10 minutes ago now. Present at the scene- in addition to the dead 
man, who was indeed Louis Thor- had been Thor's partner Bill 
Blake, and Antony Rose, an advertising agency executive who handled 
the ZING account. Neither of them, I understood, had been present 
at the filming session earlier.   "What were they doing here"? 
I asked Rawlins.   "They were supposed to meet Thor 
at nine p&m& for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their 
soap, a new angle based on this ~SX-21 stuff".   "Yeah, 
I've heard more about ~SX-21 than space exploration lately. 
What is the gunk"?   "How would I know? It's a secret. 
That was the new advertising angle- something about a Lloyd's 
of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient. Actually, 
only two men know what the formula is, Blake and"- He 
stopped and looked at Thor's body.   I said, "O&K&, 
so now only Blake knows. How's it strike you, foul or fair"?

"Can't say yet. Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked 
in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em. The ~PM 
might show he drowned instead, but that's what the once-over-lightly 
gives us. Accident, murder, suicide- take your pick". 
"I'll pick murder. Anything else"?   "According to Rose, 
he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in 
the water, got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started 
hauling him out.

Too many people think that the primary purpose of a higher education 
is to help you make a living; this is not so, for education offers 
all kinds of dividends, including how to pull the wool over a husband's 
eyes while you are having an affair with his wife. If it were 
not for an old professor who made me read the classics I would have 
been stymied on what to do, and now I understand why they are classics; 
those who wrote them knew people and what made people tick.

I worked for my Uncle (an Uncle by marriage so you will not think 
this has a mild undercurrent of incest) who ran one of those antique 
shops in New Orleans' Vieux Carre, the old French Quarter. The 
arrangement I had with him was to work four hours a day. The rest 
of the time I devoted to painting or to those other activities a young 
and healthy man just out of college finds interesting.   I had 
a one-room studio which overlooked an ancient courtyard filled with 
flowers and plants, blooming everlastingly in the southern sun. I had 
come to New Orleans two years earlier after graduating college, partly 
because I loved the city and partly because there was quite a noted 
art colony there. When my Uncle offered me a part-time job which 
would take care of my normal expenses and give me time to paint I accepted.

The arrangement turned out to be excellent. I loved the 
city and I particularly loved the gaiety and spirit of Mardi Gras. 
I had seen two of them and we would soon be in another city-wide, 
joyous celebration with romance in the air; and, when you took a walk 
you never knew what adventure or pair of sparkling eyes were waiting 
around the next corner. The very faces of the people bore this expectation 
of fun and pleasure. It was as if they could hardly wait to get 
into their costumes, cover their faces with masks and go adventuring.

My Uncle and I were not too close socially because 
of the difference in our ages. Sometimes I wondered vaguely what he 
did about women for my Aunt, by blood, had died some years ago, but neither 
of us said anything. One Monday morning I saw him approach the 
store with a woman and introduce me to her as my new Aunt. They were 
married over the week-end, though he was easily sixty and she could 
not have been even thirty. She looked more like twenty-five or six. 
It was really a May and December combination.   My new Aunt 
was perhaps three or four years older than I and it had been a long 
time since I had seen as gorgeous a woman who oozed sex. There was 
something about the contour of her face, her smile that was like New 
Orleans sunshine, the way she held her head, the way she walked- there 
was scarcely anything she did which did not fascinate me. Her legs 
were the full, sexy kind, full bodied like a rare wine and just as 
tantalizing to the appetite; the calf was magnificent, the ankle perfect.

You must forgive me if I seem to dwell too much on her 
physical aspects but I am an artist, accustomed to studying the physical 
body. The true artist is like one of those scientists who, from 
a single bone can reconstruct an animal's entire body. The artist looks 
at an ankle, a calf, a bosom and, in his mind's eye, the clothes 
drop away and he sees her as she really is. And that is the way I 
first saw her when my Uncle brought her into his antique store.

That she impressed me instantly was obvious; I was aware that when 
our eyes met we both quickly averted them. I thought I saw a faint 
surge of color rise to her neck and quickly suffuse her cheeks. True, 
she was my Aunt, married to an Uncle related to me only by marriage, 
but why she had married a man twice her age, and more, perhaps, I 
did not know or much care.   She was standing with her back to 
the glass door. Her form was silhouetted and with the strong light I 
could see the outlines of her body, a body that an artist or anyone 
else would have admired. As it is in so many affairs of the heart, a 
man and a woman meet and something clicks. Something clicked in this 
instance, but I treated her circumspectly and I felt that she knew 
it, for we both kept our distance.   When she appeared at the store 
to help out for a few hours even my looking at her was surreptitious 
lest my Uncle notice it. And then I became aware that she, too, 
glanced at me surreptitiously. I felt that her eyes were undressing me 
as if she were a painter and I a nude model. I dismissed these feelings 
as wishful thinking but I could not get it out of my head that 
we had a strong physical attraction for one another and we both feared 
to dwell on it because of our relationship. When our eyes met the air 
was filled with an unuttered message of "Me, too". You have probably 
experienced this. It is nothing you can put your fingers on but 
the air suddenly fills with a high charge of electricity.   Why 
she married him I do not know. I myself was fond of him but what a 
young woman half his age saw in him was a mystery to me. He already 
had that slow pace that comes over the elderly, while she herself had 
all the signs of one who appreciates the joys of living. Perhaps, with 
my Uncle, she found a measure of economic security that she needed; 
or maybe she liked men old enough to be her father; some women with 
father fixations do.   For several weeks we eyed one another 
almost like sparring partners, and then one day Uncle was slightly indisposed 
and stayed home; his bride opened the store. I was waiting 
in front of it when she showed up and told me of my Uncle's indisposition. 
Even as she was telling me about it I became aware of a give-away 
flush that suffused her neck and moved upwards to her cheeks, and 
subconsciously I realized that when she entered the store she did 
not switch on the lights. The cavernous depth, cluttered with antiques, 
echoed to her hard heels as she walked directly to the office in the 
rear and took the seat at his desk. She placed her palms, fingers 
outspread, on the desk in an odd gesture as if to say, "Now, what next"?

I was aware of a humid look in her eyes that told me 
the time was opportune. There was little likelihood of any customers 
walking in at that hour. I was standing beside her, watching the outspread 
palms and wondering about the old horsehair sofa against the wall 
on which he sometimes napped.   I bent and kissed the still pink 
neck and suddenly she jumped up, and her two arms encircled me in 
a bear-like crush. Her mouth, which had been so much in my thoughts, 
was warm and moist and tender. I heard her murmur, "We'd better 
lock the door".   It did not take me long to slip the bolt securely 
and return to the rear and its couch.   When we opened the 
door again for business and switched on the lights she said:

"He will not always be indisposed".   "I know. I was thinking 
about that. How will we work it out"?   "I don't 
know", she said. "You're the man. You figure it out. I've 
noticed the way you've been looking at me ever since we met".

"I guess we both felt it". I said.   "I guess so", 
she said.   "But now what"?   Even as I said it I 
realized that an education can be invaluable.   "I know what 
we can do", I said. "Tell him I made a pass at you".   She 
raised a protesting hand with a startled air.   "What are 
you trying to do? Get thrown out? If I even hint at it do you think 
it will matter that you are his nephew- and not even a blood nephew"?

"I don't want to be thrown out and I don't think 
I will. I think I have a way so we can carry on without his suspecting 
us".   "By telling him you are making passes at me"? 
she said incredulously.   "When I was in college", I 
grinned, "I remember a poem I had to read in my lit class. I don't 
even remember who wrote it but it was one of those 15th or 16th century 
poets. In those days poems often told a story in verse and those 
boys had some corkers to tell; and now I think we can use the knowledge 
they passed on to us. Tomorrow Mardi Gras opens officially. 
A lot of people will roam the streets in costumes and masks, and having 
a ball. There will be romance and flirtation. If you tell him I 
made a pass at you he might think you misunderstood something I said 
or did, so instead of just telling him I made a pass, say I tried to 
date you and that you agreed so you could prove to him what a louse
