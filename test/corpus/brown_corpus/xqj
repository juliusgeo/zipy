mind before he fell asleep.   The next day, Sunday, the hangover 
reminded Haney where he had been the night before. The hangover 
in turn reminded him of his conversation with the weirdy, and he 
groaned. He went for more aspirin later in the day, and passed the surly 
landlord on the way- he was still alive and scowling as usual, 
as if tenants were a burden in his life. Phil shrugged and ignored him.

He went back to work Monday. By Wednesday the landlord was 
still alive. Of course **h On Thursday, Haney mailed the monthly 
check for separate maintenance to his wife Lolly, and wished the stranger 
could do something about her **h   Coming home from work, 
he was startled to see a police car parked in front of the apartment 
building. Inside the lobby, people were standing around, talking excitedly. 
His spine crawled with a foreboding premonition as he asked one 
of his fellow tenants what had happened.   The landlord had died. 
Late that afternoon, it seemed, he had fallen off the roof while 
on some obscure errand or inspection. He had apparently been alone. Nobody 
witnessed the fall- just the sickening impact when his body smashed 
on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance.

Haney hoped that nobody noticed his sudden pallor, as he felt the 
blood drain from his cheeks. He muttered something about how terrible 
it was, and walked with deliberate slowness to the elevator. Once 
inside his apartment, he poured a drink with trembling hands and flopped 
limply in a chair.   After a while he began to feel better about 
it, especially when no one bothered to ask any questions. But after 
all, why should they? Still later, he finally convinced himself 
that it <was> an accident- just a coincidence. The stranger really 
had nothing to do with it, of course **h   Haney went to bed, 
happy that at least he was rid of that lousy landlord. After all, the 
man had no family, so no one suffered, and everybody was better off 
for it. Really, he said to himself, nobody kills a man just as a favor!

<So you thought I didn't mean what I said>. The stranger's 
eyes were large and sad, as if Phil Haney had hurt his feelings. 
It was like a recurrent, annoying dream, but now the dream was 
beginning to take on overtones of a nightmare.   However, Haney 
knew it was not a dream. He might be very tight, but he knew where 
he was. It was the same bar, and it was two weeks later- Saturday 
night, when he had an excuse to drink heavier than usual. ##

HE 
had been sitting in the usual corner at the little table, as far as possible 
from any talkative, friendly lushes. He was enjoying the weekly 
ritual of washing down his pet grievance with bourbon slightly moistened 
with water. This favorite grievance was not the landlord. He had 
already quite forgotten about him. In fact, he had only mentioned him 
on the spur of the moment. His real grievance was Lolly.   Toward 
the end of his fourth hairy highball, while he was moodily making 
wet rings on the table-top with the bottom of the glass, he became 
aware that he was not alone. He looked up with bloodshot eyes and beheld 
the stranger sitting across the table, smiling a secret smile at him, 
as if they were fellow conspirators. He hadn't even noticed- 
what was his name? Pete?- he hadn't seen him sit down. The man 
was uncanny, like a shadow, and made as much noise as a shadow.

Haney felt like shrinking out of sight, but he was already trapped 
in the corner with the wiry, dark little man. He began to wish that 
he hadn't shouted that other evening when the truck bore down through 
the crossing. Was he going to be saddled from now on with a creep 
for a bar-buddy? He'd have to start going to some of the other places 
again.   In a low voice, almost whispering, the man had asked 
Phil if he was happy with the way the landlord had been taken off 
his back. He made the mistake of answering in an offhand way, and instantly 
realized that his skepticism must have showed in his face or voice.

Pete frowned slightly, then became sad and moody. Haney 
didn't want to encourage his company, but felt he ought to buy him a 
drink anyhow, to prevent possible trouble. But there was no trouble. 
The guy sulked over his drink, obviously upset by Haney's lack of 
appreciation.   To break the uncomfortable silence, Haney began 
to talk. In time, and two drinks later, he was complaining bitterly 
about his wife, He was on the subject for ten minutes or so when he 
noticed the renewed interest in his listener- it showed in the alert 
face and the suddenly bright eyes.   When he paused to moisten 
his throat, the stranger broke in. "But why pay her bills? If she 
runs around with other men, and if you hate her as you say, why not 
just divorce her"?   Haney scowled. "That bitch would love 
a divorce", he growled. "Then she'd get half of everything I 
have. Community property deal- you know. I'd have to sell out 
my business to pay her off with her share. She can drop dead"!

Pete nodded understandingly. "Oh yes. Now I see. You must 
understand, I haven't been in this state too long. I came out here 
to retire. That's why I- why I do a free job now and then. You 
should have told me about her before".   Haney felt a twinge 
of annoyance when he heard the now familiar line again. Then a wild 
thought ran circles through his clouded brain. Suppose- just suppose 
this guy was really what he said he was! A retired professional killer 
**h If he was just a nut, no harm was done. But if he was the 
real thing, he could do something about Lolly. He felt very cunning, 
very proud of himself as he played on the other man's soft spot.

"No offense intended", he said gently. "But it's just that- 
well, you know. The cops didn't suspect a thing, and I thought 
it was a coincidence. After all, I didn't know you, Pete. It 
<could> have been an accident". He shrugged casually. "But if 
you say you managed it **h" The stranger was hooked. His eyes burned 
feverishly. "Yes, yes", he muttered impatiently. "Of course 
it looked like an accident. I always work it that way- and always 
at a time when the customer has an alibi. Let me prove it, Phil. I 
think I can manage one more favor for you". He waited eagerly.

Haney swished the liquor in the bottom of his glass. 
About halfway back Pops groped against a wall and stopped, pulled away 
two loosely nailed wide boards at one end, and went through. "C'mon", 
he whispered; "floor level's about three feet down, so 
don't fall". I went through and down, into pitch darkness. He said, 
"Jist stay still. I'll pull the boards back and then get us 
a light. Jist stay where you are". I jist stayed where I was while 
he fumbled around and then walked away. A moment later he struck a 
match and lighted a candle, and I could see.   It was a big room, 
empty except for a few things of Pop's at the far end- a wooden 
crate on which stood the candle, a spread out blanket, and an unrolled 
bindle. I looked back over my shoulder while I went to join him; 
he'd hung another half of a blanket over the boarded window so no 
light would show through.   I took the pint bottle from my pocket 
and handed it over as I sat down beside him on the spread blanket. 
"You first", I said.   He drank and handed it back. "Nice 
place", I told him. "Listen, I got a buddy I travel with, 
real nice guy named Larry. I know where he is, right near here. Could 
he join the party and sleep here tonight too? We'll both be blowing 
town tomorrow so we won't be moving in on you".   He hesitated 
a second, looking at the bottle, before he said "Sure-sure", 
and I reassured him. "He'll bring a bottle too, and I'll 
get another one or maybe two while I'm out. You can work on this 
one while I'm gone, kill it if you want". I took a short swallow 
from it myself and handed it to him.   His "sure-sure" was 
enthusiastic this time. He put the bottle down. "Git over by the window 
while there's light, an' I'll put th' candle out. When 
yuh come back I'll put it out agin till you're both inside".

Charlie was waiting, leaning against a building front. "Perfect 
set-up", I told him. "But we got to go back to Fifth and get 
another bottle or two. On the way I'll give you the scoop".

On the way I gave him the scoop. I bought another pint of sherry 
and when we got back Pops let us in in the dark, put back the blanket 
and then lighted the candle again. I introduced my friend Larry 
to Pops and we made ourselves comfortable. There was still a little, 
not much, left in the first bottle and we passed it around once and 
killed it, and Charlie opened his.   I was reminded, amusedly, 
by a poem of Kenneth Patchen's called <The Murder of Two Men 
by a Young Kid Wearing Lemon Colored Gloves>, which Patchen himself 
read on a record against jazz background. The poem consisted of 
only two words, the word "Wait", repeated over and over at irregular 
intervals and with different inflections, and then the word "Now"! 
and a blaring final chord from the jazz group.   This was 
the same, except that it was the murder of one man by two men and neither 
of us was wearing gloves. But we could wait all right; there 
was no hurry. I said, "Wait **h wait" to Charlie and he grinned, 
digging the reference. We'd heard the record together once.

The second bottle passed a few times. Pop was taking long ones, but 
not showing the effect yet. He seemed as drunk as when I'd first 
talked to him, but no drunker. He had a capacity; if we'd really 
been trying to get him dead drunk we'd have had to go out for more 
wine.   About halfway through the second bottle, Charlie looked 
at me across Pops, who was sitting between us and asked "Now"? 
I said, "Wait", and handed the bottle to Pops for his final 
drink. When he handed it back and I had hold of it safely, Pops was 
looking toward me and I said "Now", to Charlie and he swung 
the short length of lead pipe he'd meanwhile taken from his pocket, 
once. It was a lead pipe cinch.   There was a sound like the one 
you produce by flicking a watermelon with your finger, only louder, 
and Pops fell forward from the waist and then over sidewise. Out cold, 
if not dead; and he'd never known what hit him- he'd never 
known that <anything> had hit him.   I reached my hand toward 
him to put it inside his shirt to feel for a heartbeat, but Charlie 
said "Wait"!- and said it sharply, not as in the Patchen bit, 
but as an order- so I stopped my hand and looked at him. He was 
holding the piece of lead pipe out to me.   "We don't want to 
know whether he's dead, yet. I gauged that blow to be borderline. 
To kayo him and maybe or maybe not kill. You hit again about twice 
that hard before we know whether he's dead or not. That way we'll 
never know which of us really killed him and which was just the accomplice. 
Dig"?   I dug him, I saw his point; it made sense. 
I took the piece of pipe from Charlie's hand and used it, harder 
than he had. The <thunk> was louder, anyway, and I thought I heard 
bone crack.   Charlie said, "Good boy. That did it, if mine 
didn't. And we'll never know which. All right, now I'll give 
you a hand".   We straightened Pops up and I made sure there 
was no trace of a heartbeat.   I nodded to Charlie. "Let's 
put him down again the way he was. It's a more natural position". 
We did that.   "How do you feel"? Charlie asked me.

"Cool", I told him. "What do you feel"?   "Nothing. 
Well **h maybe I'm exaggerating. It was a kick, but not 
a big enough one for me to want to take the chance again, except for 
stakes. But let's not talk about it abstractly until we're out of 
here. Now, first question: the bottles. Shall we take them all with 
us, or leave one"?   "Take them", I said. "If we 
left one we'd have to wipe it for fingerprints. Here's the picture 
we want to leave for the fuzz- whenever the body gets found. This 
happened in the middle of a drinking bout with another bum. If they'd 
been working on a bottle or a jug he'd have taken it with him".

"Right. And he'd have taken the weapon with him too, so 
we take that. Now"- He looked around. "I've been careful 
about fingerprints. How about you"?   "Same. There are
