Eugene was in his pajamas and dressing gown, and on his large feet he 
wore yellow Turkish slippers that turned up at the toes.   "Ex-cuse 
me", he said in Berlitz English, and got up and left them, 
to bathe and dress.   The first shrill ring of the telephone brought 
Harold out into the hall. He realized that he had no idea where 
the telephone was. At that moment the bathroom door flew open and 
Eugene came out, with his face lathered for shaving, and strode down 
the hall, tying the sash of his dressing gown as he went. The telephone 
was in the study but the ringing came from the hall. Between the telephone 
and the wall plug there was sixty feet of cord, and when the 
conversation came to an end, Eugene carried the instrument with him the 
whole length of the apartment, to his bathroom, where it rang three 
more times while he was shaving and in the tub. Before he left the apartment 
he knocked on their door and asked if there was anything he could 
do for them. Harold shook his head.   "Sabine called a few 
minutes ago", Eugene said. "She wants you and Barbara to have 
dinner with her tomorrow night".   He handed Harold a key to 
the front door, and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while 
they were out of the apartment.   When enough time had elapsed so 
that there was little likelihood of his returning for something he had 
forgotten, Harold went out into the hall and stood looking into one 
room after another. In the room next to theirs was a huge cradle, of 
mahogany, ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf. It was the 
most important-looking cradle he had ever seen. Then came their bathroom, 
and then a bedroom that, judging by the photographs on the walls, 
must belong to ~Mme Cestre. A young woman who looked like Alix, 
with her two children. Alix and Eugene on their wedding day. Matching 
photographs in oval frames of ~Mme Bonenfant and an elderly man 
who must be Alix's grandfather. ~Mme Vienot, considerably younger 
and very different. The schoolboy. And a gray-haired man whose 
glance- direct, lifelike, and mildly accusing- was contradicted by 
the gilt and black frame. It was the kind of frame that is only put 
around the photograph of a dead person. Professor Cestre, could it 
be?   With the metal shutters closed, the dining room was so dark 
that it seemed still night in there. One of the drawing-room shutters 
was partly open and he made out the shapes of chairs and sofas, which 
seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet velvet. The curtains 
were of the same material, and there were some big oil paintings- portraits 
in the style of Lancret and Boucher.   Though, taken 
individually, the big rooms were, or seemed to be, square, the apartment 
as a whole formed a triangle. The apex, the study where Eugene slept, 
was light and bright and airy and cheerful. The window looked out 
on the Place Redoute- it was the only window of the apartment that 
did. Looking around slowly, he saw a marble fireplace, a desk, a low 
bookcase of mahogany with criss-crossed brass wire instead of glass 
panes in the doors. The daybed Eugene had slept in, made up now with 
its dark-brown velours cover and pillows. The portable record player 
with a pile of classical records beside it. Beethoven's Fifth was 
the one on top. Da-da-da-dum **h Music could not be Eugene's passion. 
Besides, the records were dusty. He tried the doors of the bookcase. 
Locked. The titles he could read easily through the criss-crossed 
wires: works on theology, astral physics, history, biology, political 
science. No poetry. No novels. He moved over to the desk and 
stood looking at the papers on it but not touching anything. The clock 
on the mantel piece was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced 
at it over his shoulder and then quickly left the room. #@# 

THE CONCIERGE CALLED OUT to them as they were passing through 
the foyer. 
Her quarters were on the right as you walked into the building, and 
her small front room was clogged with heavy furniture- a big, round, 
oak dining table and chairs, a buffet, with a row of unclaimed letters 
inserted between the mirror and its frame. The suitcases had come 
while they were out, and had been put in their room, the concierge said.

He waited until they were inside the elevator and then said: 
"Now what do we do"?   "Call the Vouillemont, I 
guess".   "I guess".   Rather than sit around waiting 
for the suitcases to be delivered, they had gone sight-seeing. They 
went to the Flea Market, expecting to find the treasures of Europe, 
and found instead a duplication of that long double row of booths in 
Tours. Cheap clothing and junk of every sort, as far as the eye could 
see. They looked, even so. Looked at everything. Barbara bought 
some cotton aprons, and Harold bought shoestrings. They had lunch 
at a sidewalk cafe overlooking the intersection of two broad, busy, 
unpicturesque streets, and coming home they got lost in the Metro; 
it took them over an hour to get back to the station where they should 
have changed, in order to take the line that went to the Place Redoute. 
It was the end of the afternoon when he took the huge key out of 
his pocket and inserted it into the keyhole. When he opened the door, 
there stood Eugene, on his way out of the apartment. He was wearing 
sneakers and shorts and an open-collared shirt, and in his hand he carried 
a little black bag. He did not explain where he was going, and 
they did not ask. Instead, they went on down the hall to their room.

"Do you think he could be having an affair"? Barbara asked, 
as they heard the front door close.   "Oh no", Harold 
said, shocked.   "Well, this is France, after all". 
"I know, but there must be some other explanation. He's probably 
spending the evening with friends".   "And for that he needs 
a little bag"?   They went shopping in the neighborhood, 
and bought two loaves of bread with the ration coupons they had been given 
in Blois, and some cheese, and a dozen eggs, and a bag of oranges 
from a peddler in the Place Redoute- the first oranges they had 
seen since they landed. They had Vermouth, sitting in front of a cafe. 
When they got home Harold was grateful for the stillness in the apartment, 
and thought how, under different circumstances, they might have 
stayed on here, in these old-fashioned, high-ceilinged rooms that 
reminded him of the Irelands' apartment in the East Eighties. They 
could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days.   He 
went down the hall to Eugene's bathroom, to turn on the hot-water 
heater, and on the side of the tub he saw a pair of blue wool swimming 
trunks. He felt them. They were damp. He reached out and felt the 
bath towel hanging on the towel rack over the tub. Damp also. He looked 
around the room and then called out: "Come here, quick"?

"What is it"? Barbara asked, standing in the doorway. "I've 
solved the mystery of the little bag. There it is **h and there 
is what was in it. But where do people go swimming in Paris? 
That boat in the river, maybe".   "What boat"?   "There's 
a big boat anchored near the Place de la Concorde, with 
a swimming pool in it- didn't you notice it? But if he has time 
to go swimming, he had time to be with us".   She looked at 
him in surprise.   "I know", he said, reading her mind.

"I don't know what I'm going to do with you".   "It's 
because we are in France", he said, "and know so few people. 
So something like this matters more than it would at home. Also, 
he was so nice when he <was> nice".   "All because I didn't 
feel like dancing".   "I don't think it was that, really".

"Then what was it"?   "I don't know. I 
wish I did. The tweed coat, maybe. The thing about Eugene is that 
he's very proud".   And the thing about hurt feelings, the 
wet bathing suit pointed out, is that the person who has them is not quite 
the innocent party he believes himself to be. For instance- what 
about all those people Harold Rhodes went toward unhesitatingly, 
as if this were the one moment they would ever have together, their one 
chance of knowing each other?   Fortunately, the embarrassing 
questions raised by objects do not need to be answered, or we would 
all have to go sleep in the open fields. And in any case, answers may 
clarify but they do not change anything. 
**h he brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes, of about a hundred 
pounds' weight. They took Jesus's body, then, and wrapped it 
in winding-clothes with the spices; that is how the Jews prepare a 
body for burial.   Listed as present at the Descent were Mary, 
Mary's sister, Mary Magdalene, John, Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus. 
Search as he might, he could find no place where the Bible 
spoke of a moment when Mary could have been alone with Jesus. Mostly 
the scene was crowded with mourners, such as the dramatic Dell'Arca 
Lamentation in Bologna, where the grief-stricken spectators had 
usurped Mary's last poignant moment.   In his concept there could 
be no one else present.   His first desire was to create a 
mother and son alone in the universe. When might Mary have had that 
moment to hold her child on her lap? Perhaps after the soldiers had 
laid him on the ground, while Joseph of Arimathea was at Pontius Pilate's 
asking for Christ's body, Nicodemus was gathering his mixture 
of myrrh and aloes, and the others had gone home to mourn. Those 
who saw his finished Pieta would take the place of the biblical witnesses. 
They would feel what Mary was undergoing. There would be no 
halos, no angels. These would be two human beings, whom God had chosen.

He felt close to Mary, having spent so long concentrating 
on the beginning of her journey. Now she was intensely alive, anguished; 
her son was dead. Even though he would later be resurrected, 
he was at this moment dead indeed, the expression on his face reflecting 
what he had gone through on the cross. In his sculpture therefore 
it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus felt 
for his mother; only what Mary felt for her son. Jesus' inert 
body would be passive, his eyes closed. Mary would have to carry the 
human communication. This seemed right to him.   It was a relief 
to shift in his mind to technical problems. Since his Christ was 
to be life size, how was Mary to hold him on her lap without the relationship 
seeming ungainly? His Mary would be slender of limb and 
delicate of proportion, yet she must hold this full-grown man as securely 
and convincingly as she would a child.   There was only one 
way to accomplish this: by design, by drawing diagrams and sketches 
in which he probed the remotest corner of his mind for creative ideas 
to carry his concept.   He started by making free sketches to loosen 
up his thinking so that images would appear on paper. Visually, 
these approximated what he was feeling within himself. At the same time 
he started walking the streets, peering at the people passing or shopping 
at the stalls, storing up fresh impressions of what they looked 
like, how they moved. In particular he sought the gentle, sweet-faced 
nuns, with head coverings and veils coming to the middle of their foreheads, 
remembering their expressions until he reached home and set them 
down on paper.   Discovering that draperies could be designed 
to serve structural purposes, he began a study of the anatomy of folds. 
He improvised as he went along, completing a life-size clay figure, 
then bought yards of an inexpensive material from a draper, wet the 
lightweight cloth in a basin and covered it over with clay that Argiento 
brought from the bank of the Tiber, to the consistency of thick 
mud. No fold could be accidental, each turn of the drapery had to serve 
organically, to cover the Madonna's slender legs and feet so that 
they would give substantive support to Christ's body, to intensify 
her inner turmoil. When the cloth dried and stiffened, he saw what 
adjustments had to be made.   "So that's sculpture", commented 
Argiento wryly, when he had sluiced down the floor for a week, "making 
mud pies".   Michelangelo grinned. "See, Argiento, 
if you control the way these folds are bunched, like this, or made to 
flow, you can enrich the body attitudes. They can have as much tactile 
appeal as flesh and bone".   He went into the Jewish quarter, 
wanting to draw Hebraic faces so that he could reach a visual understanding 
of how Christ might have looked. The Jewish section was 
in Trastevere, near the Tiber at the church of San Francesco a Ripa. 
The colony had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 
drove many Jews into Rome. Here, for the most part, they were well 
treated, as a "reminder of the Old Testament heritage of Christianity"; 
many of their gifted members were prominent in the Vatican 
as physicians, musicians, bankers.   The men did not object to
