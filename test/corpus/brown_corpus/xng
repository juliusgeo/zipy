too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter 
hanging in midair. The ramifications of the issue are enormous. A 
decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have 
to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations, and might in 
effect place the public employment services in the position of acting 
as strikebreakers. The public interest is so dominant in such an issue 
that I cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative 
order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action 
in one or two Superior Courts in the State. It is an issue which 
may well reach the Supreme Court of the United States before judicial 
finality is achieved.   As an administrator, I cannot place 
the Employment Service in California in jeopardy of being out of compliance 
with the Federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of 
appeal open to me. To have applied statewide the decisions of the two 
cases heard in Superior Court, in my opinion, would have placed us 
clearly out of compliance with the Wagner-Peyser Act and would have 
immediately opened the way for the Secretary of Labor, were he so 
inclined, to notify the Governor of such noncompliance, set a date for 
hearing, and issue his finding. The impact of noncompliance under 
the Wagner-Peyser Act is clear: the withdrawal of some $11 million 
a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service 
program or, as a corollary, the taking over by the Federal Government 
of its operation.   Thus far, the cases which have come before 
the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is 
vacant due to a strike- condition (1) in the Regulation of the Secretary. 
None has yet arisen under condition (2), relating to referral 
to jobs "the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute".

Here the problem is essentially one of defining the word "filling". 
Should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements 
as job specifications, union membership, union jurisdiction, and 
the like? Or should it have a broader connotation of including wage 
demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the 
mechanics of "filling" the job.   Because of the uncertainty 
of this definition, I solicited the interpretation of the Secretary 
of Labor. He has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the 
proper one; that is, that if wages, for example, is the only issue 
in a labor dispute, and no workers have left their jobs because of the 
dispute, we may continue to make referrals. 
_9._ Martin and Stendler present evidence that infants and young 
children can and do solve many problems at a relatively simple perceptual 
level simply by combining objects and counting them. After they 
have developed concepts, they are free from the necessity of manipulating 
objects; they do symbolically what they once had to do concretely. 
The ability to think seems to increase consistently with age. One 
experiment showed the greatest one-year difference occurring between 
the eleventh and twelfth years. _10._ Many studies indicate that 
elementary-school children's interests cover the whole field of science; 
that their questions indicate a genuine interest in social processes 
and events; and that as they mature their interests and capabilities 
change and broaden. _EMOTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS_ How a child 
feels about himself, about other people, and about the tasks confronting 
him in school may have as much influence on his success in school 
as his physical and intellectual characteristics. A considerable amount 
of evidence exists to show that an unhappy and insecure child is not 
likely to do well in school subjects. Emotional maturity is the result 
of many factors, the principal ones being the experiences of the 
first few years of the child's life. However, the teacher who understands 
the influence of emotions on behavior may be highly influential 
in helping pupils gain confidence, security, and satisfaction. 
Concerning this responsibility of the teacher, suggestions for helping 
children gain better control of the emotions are presented in Chapter 
11. The following generalizations about the emotional characteristics 
of elementary-school children may be helpful. _1._ Typically, 
the young child's emotional reactions last for a relatively short 
time, as contrasted to those of an adult. _2._ As the child grows 
older, his emotional reactions lead to "moods", or emotional states 
drawn out over a period of time and expressed slowly, rather than in 
short, abrupt outbursts. _3._ Studies of the growth and decline 
of children's fears indicate that fears due to strange objects, noises, 
falling, and unexpected movement decline during the preschool years, 
but that fears of the dark, of being alone, and of imaginary creatures 
or robbers increase. _4._ Ridiculing a child for being afraid 
or forcing him to meet the feared situation alone are poor ways of dealing 
with the problem; more effective solutions include explanations, 
the example of another child, or conditioning by associating the feared 
object, place, or person with something pleasant. _5._ Children 
need help in learning to control their emotions. The young child 
learns from parents and teachers that temper tantrums, screaming, kicking, 
and hitting will not get him what he wants; the older child learns 
that intense emotional outbursts will not win approval by his peers, 
and, therefore, makes a real effort to control his emotions. _6._ 
Children differ widely in their emotional responses. Among infants 
the patterns of emotional responses are similar; as the influence 
of learning and environment are felt, emotional behavior becomes individualized. 
_SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS_ Although no national norms exist 
for the social development of children, the teacher can find a great 
deal of information concerning types of social behavior normally displayed 
by children at various age levels. The following summary will 
give the student some idea about the social characteristics of elementary-school 
children; the student will certainly want to explore more 
deeply into the fascinating study of immature individuals, struggling 
to meet their developmental needs, and at the same time trying to learn 
the rules of the game in the ever-expanding number of groups in which 
they hold membership. _1._ During early childhood, children 
are more interested in the approval of their parents and teachers than 
they are in the approval of other children; after they have been in 
school a few years, their interest in playmates of their own age increases, 
and their interest in adults decreases; the child who had once 
considered it a treat to accompany his parents on picnics and family 
gatherings now considers it a bore. In late childhood the influence 
of the group on the social behavior of the child continues to increase; 
the group sets the styles in clothing, the kind of play engaged in, 
and the ideals of right and wrong behavior. _2._ In early childhood 
the choice of a companion is likely to be for another child of his 
own age or a year or two older, who can do the things he likes to do; 
such factors as sex, intelligence, and status in the group do not 
influence his choice much at this time. _3._ In later childhood, 
an interest in team games replaces individual play; loyalty to the group, 
a feeling of superiority over those who are not members, and unwillingness 
to play with members of the opposite sex become dominant traits. 
_4._ During early childhood boys tease and bully, on the average, 
more than girls; those who feel inferior or insecure engage in 
these activities more than do well-adjusted children. _5._ During 
late childhood boys like to tease, jostle, and talk smart to girls; 
girls, who are more mature than boys, frown upon the youthful antics 
of boys of their own age. _6._ By the time pupils reach the sixth 
grade, their ethical and moral standards are fairly well developed; 
they exhibit a keen interest in social, political, and economic problems, 
but they frequently have vague and incorrect notions about the 
terms they use rather glibly in their routine school work. _7._ Between 
the ages of two and four years, negativism or resistance to adult 
authority is noticeable; after the fourth year it begins to decline. 
However, as we have seen, in later childhood the child begins to 
substitute the standards of the peer group for those of parents and teachers. 
_8._ The elementary-school child grows gradually in his ability 
to work in groups. The child in the primary grades can play harmoniously 
with one companion, but his desire to be first in everything 
gets him into trouble when the group gets larger; he wants to be with 
people, but he hasn't yet learned to cooperate. In the middle grades, 
however, he begins to participate more effectively in group activities 
such as selecting a leader, helping to make plans and carry on 
group activities, and setting up rules governing the enterprise. 

#WHY 
THE TEACHER SHOULD STUDY THE INDIVIDUAL PUPIL#

Much progress has 
been made in the last two decades in developing techniques for understanding 
children, yet in almost any classroom today can be found children 
whose needs are not being met by the school program. Some are failing 
to achieve as much as their ability would permit; others never 
seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom. These children 
have been described as those who were trying to say something to adults 
who did not understand.   Many school systems now employ school 
psychologists and child guidance specialists. These specialists 
perform valuable services by helping teachers learn to identify children 
who need special attention, by suggesting ways of meeting the needs 
of individual children in the regular classroom, and by providing clinical 
services for severely maladjusted children. It is the classroom 
teacher, however, who has daily contacts with pupils, and who is in a 
unique position to put sound psychological principles into practice. 
Indeed, a study of the individual child is an integral part of the work 
of the elementary-school teacher, rather than merely an additional 
chore.   Teachers and administrators in many elementary schools 
have assumed that dividing the pupils in any grade into groups on the 
basis of test scores solves the problem of meeting the needs of individuals. 
What they should recognize is that children who have been placed 
in one of these groups on a narrow academic basis still differ widely 
in attributes that influence success, and that they still must be 
treated as individuals. Although the teacher must be concerned with 
maintaining standards, he must also be concerned about understanding 
differences in ability, background, and experience. _FACTORS THAT INHIBIT 
LEARNING AND LEAD TO MALADJUSTMENT_ Studies conducted in various 
sections of the United States indicate that many children in elementary 
schools are maladjusted emotionally, and that many of them are 
failing to make satisfactory progress in school subjects. One study, 
which involved 1,524 pupils in grades one to six, found that 12 percent 
of the pupils were seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent were reading 
a year below capacity. It is apparent, therefore, that the teacher 
needs to know what factors have a vital bearing on the learning and 
adjustment of children. When a child fails to meet the standards of 
the school in his rate of learning, insecurity, unhappiness, and other 
forms of maladjustment frequently follow. These maladjustments in 
turn inhibit learning, and a vicious cycle is completed.   It is 
easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who is not achieving 
in accordance with his known ability is just plain lazy, or that the 
child who lacks interest in school, who dislikes the teacher, or who 
is overaggressive is a hopeless delinquent. The causes of retardation 
and maladjustment may be found in physical factors, such as defective 
speech or hearing, impaired vision, faulty motor coordination, a frail 
constitution, chronic disease, malnutrition, and glandular malfunctioning. 
They may be caused by poor health habits, such as faulty eating 
and sleeping habits. They may be related to mental immaturity or lack 
of aptitude for certain types of school work. The curriculum may 
be too difficult for some and too easy for others. Teaching methods, 
learning materials, and promotion policies may inhibit learning and lead 
to maladjustments for some children. Unwholesome family relations, 
broken homes, and undesirable community influences may also be contributing 
factors. This is only a minimum list of the factors that inhibit 
learning and contribute to maladjustment among children. Moreover, 
these conditions do not influence all children in the same manner. A 
vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and reading 
disability 
for one child may spur another child on to even greater achievement 
in reading. An impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute 
the motivation causing another to work harder for successful 
achievement in school. At any rate, the teacher who recognizes common 
causes of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal 
to eliminate the causes of pupil discouragement, failure, and maladjustment.
