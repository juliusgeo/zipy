enough to toss 'em through the window".   He slipped outside, 
hugging the walls of buildings and dodging into doorways. Blue Throat's 
men spotted him and a hail of bullets splintered the store fronts 
and board walk as he passed.   Fifty yards away from the barn 
he dodged inside a barber's shop and came out at the back. Here he 
couldn't be seen by Blue Throat and his gang. All he had to do 
was light the fuses of the dynamite sticks, run to within ten yards of 
an open window in the barn and hurl the sticks through.   Billy 
Tilghman did just that. Within seconds the big barn was blasted into 
smoking splinters, with every outlaw either dead or injured inside. 
It was the abrupt end of Blue Throat's dictatorship in Petrie. Though 
only slightly injured himself the big hoodlum never returned to 
those parts.   To Tilghman the incident was just one of a long 
list of hair-raising, smash-'em-down adventures on the side of the 
law which started in 1872 when he was only eighteen years old, and did 
not end till fifty years later when he was shot dead after warning 
a drunk to be quiet.   Of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boys 
of the Old West, "Uncle Billy Tilghman" stands out head and 
shoulders. He was the lawman who survived more gunfights than any 
other famous gun-slinging character in the book. He saw the most action, 
beat up more badmen with his bare fists, broke up the most gangs and 
sent more murderers to the gallows than any other U&S& marshal 
who lived before or after him.   For fifty years his guns and 
ham-like fists shot holes through and battered the daylights out of the 
enemies of law and order in the frontier towns of the West. 
The deeds of countless western bandits and outlaws have been glorified 
almost to the point of hero-worship, but because Billy Tilghman remained 
strictly on the side of the law throughout his action-packed career, 
his achievements and the appalling risks he took while taming the 
West have remained almost unsung.   Citizens took the view that 
a lawman was expected to risk his life on the odd occasion anyway, 
but this fighting fury of a man risked it regularly over a period of 
half a century.   He came within an ace of being riddled with bullets 
during his long fight with the Doolin gang which terrorized Oklahoma 
in the 1890's. Led by Bill Doolin, these mobsters specialized 
in train robberies but as a sideline they looted stores and robbed 
banks, making liberal use of their guns. Bill Doolin's ambition, 
it appeared, was to carve out his name with bullets alongside those of 
Jesse James and Billy the Kid, and Bill Tilghman had sworn he would 
stop him.   Tilghman knew that some ranchers were hand-in-glove 
with the Doolin gang. They bought rustled cattle from the outlaw, 
kept him supplied with guns and ammunition, harbored his men in their 
houses. Billy decided to set an example by arresting one of the ranchers, 
named Ed Dunn, who lived at Rock Fort.   On a bitterly 
cold day in January, 1895, accompanied only by Neal Brown as his 
deputy, Tilghman left the township of Guthrie and headed for Rock Fort 
and Dunn's ranch. It was snowing hard when they got there and 
they saw no horses outside. The only evidence of occupation came from 
the chimney, which was belching out thick smoke.   The two lawmen 
halted their wagon about twenty yards from the door. "Wait here, 
Neal", said Tilghman. "If I don't come out within half an 
hour ride back to town and bring out a posse".   Leaving his rifle 
in the wagon, Tilghman walked up to the door and hammered on it. 
There was no reply so he shoved it open with his foot and stepped inside. 
Directly opposite the door was a roaring log fire, a welcome sight 
on that bitterly cold day. Seated near it with his back to the door 
was the rancher, Ed Dunn.   "Hello, Ed", said Tilghman. 
The rancher grunted an acknowledgement but didn't move.   Tilghman 
closed the door behind him and walked towards the fire. Suddenly 
he saw something which made his big heart give a sickening lurch 
and caused the hairs to bristle on the back of his neck. Along each side 
of the room were six tiered bunks, each one screened off with a curtain.

And projecting wickedly through these curtains were the 
gleaming muzzles of six rifles, all trained on Billy Tilghman. The 
fighting marshal had walked right into a trap and at any moment six slugs 
might slam into his hide.   Thinking fast, Tilghman never 
hesitated for one instant. He walked right up to the fire as though blissfully 
unaware of the guns covering him. The men behind them were 
Bill Doolin and five of his gang- every man a killer.   "Cold 
day", said Tilghman, placing his hands behind him and casually 
presenting his backside to the fire. "Just dropped in to ask where 
Jed Hawkins lives. Can't seem to locate landmarks in this snow".

The rancher was trembling. He wouldn't look Tilghman in 
the face. "Follow the river for five miles", he said hoarsely. "Jed's 
homestead is on the south bank".   Resisting the overwhelming 
temptation to flng himself out of that bristling death-trap, 
Tilghman deliberately engaged the nervous rancher in trivial conversation 
for a good ten minutes. All that time rifle barrels were pointing 
unwaveringly at his head and body. One false move on his part and 
he would be a dead man.   "Well", he announced, "Guess I'll 
be going now, Ed, and thanks for the warmup". He strolled back 
to the door, whistling softly, hands still clasped behind him. He 
left the house and almost certain death without even increasing his pace 
and wondered by what remarkable stroke of Providence he had been 
allowed to come out alive.   But he knew well enough that those 
guns would still be trained on his back as he walked towards the wagon. 
If he showed signs of collecting his rifle and going back with his 
deputy to the ranch he would be shot down instantly.   Leisurely 
he climbed on to the wagon next to Neal Brown. "Don't say or 
do anything", he said softly. "Just get out of here without it looking 
as though we're in a hurry. That place is crawling with Bill 
Doolin and his gang".   Even as he spoke those words Billy 
Tilghman's life hung on a thread. Back in the house a hoodlum named 
Red Buck, sore because Billy had been allowed to leave unscathed, 
jumped from a bunk and swore he was going after him to kill him right 
then.   "You'll stay right here", commanded Bill Doolin, 
covering Red with his rifle. "Billy Tilghman is too good a man 
to shoot in the back. We'll let him go".   But the fighting 
marshal's fifty-year run of immunity from violent death came to a 
full and final stop one night in a street at Cromwell, Oklahoma, where 
he had been sent to clean up the gambling and vice rackets. 
Wiley Lynn, a self-styled prohibition officer, had hit town the previous 
day and had been drinking ever since. That night he reeled out 
of Ma Murphy's dance hall and proceeded to disturb the peace by shooting 
off his revolver. 
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS now, Jack Carter, a big overgrown boy of fifteen 
with a fuzzy, pimpled face and greenish catlike eyes with a lot 
of red in them, had been haunted by a dream, a vision, of a Woman. This 
Woman had no distinct shape or size and no particular face, but she 
radiated warmth, a sweet warmth; she would talk to him in a soothing 
voice about things his mother would have said were not nice and put 
her hands on him and kiss him passionately. When she would do these 
things, he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at his stomach. 
Then he would run to the toilet behind the house. Sometimes he 
did this three or four times a day, for this Woman was almost always 
with him. He would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether his mother 
and father knew- thinking they might see it in his eyes or smell 
it on him. But they never said anything, so he figured it was all right.

And so when Miss Langford came to teach at the one-room 
Chestnut school, where Jack was a pupil in the eighth grade, the Woman 
of Jack's mind assumed the teacher's face and figure. He could 
not keep his eyes off her when at school; when he went home at 
night, he took her with him in his mind, and she did the things the anonymous 
Woman used to do, and he did the thing afterwards each time as 
he used to do. When he awoke in the mornings, she was in his mind and 
he could hardly wait to get to school to be near her in the flesh.

Miss Langford (her first name was Evelyn) was an attractive 
girl. Tall, blonde, blue-eyes, fair, buxom without being heavy, she cut 
a fine figure of budding womanhood as she swished among the pupils 
in her fresh, starched summer dress. Something was beginning to stir 
and come alive in her, too (it may have been there for a good while, since 
she was twenty now; but if it had been, it had been smothered until 
now by fear): you could tell it by the way she watched the older, 
bigger boys, like Jack. She would look at Jack, with that hidden 
something in her eyes, and Jack would see the Woman and become breathless 
and a little sick.   School began in August, the hottest 
part of the year, and for the first few days Miss Langford was very 
lenient with the children, letting them play a lot and the new ones sort 
of get acquainted with one another. The first two or three days they 
went home early.   All, that is, except Jack. He hung around 
the schoolhouse, watching through a window from outside while Miss 
Langford straightened desks and put the room in order. Once (this was 
on the third day of school) she kneeled down to pick up some books 
where they'd dropped on the floor and Jack looked up her dress- 
at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg. He thought for a moment 
his heart had stopped beating. About that time Miss Langford straightened 
up and looked out the window directly at him, he thought, although 
probably she didn't even see him. He jumped back, ducked and ran, 
crouching, down the hill away from the school.   He didn't 
look back and he ran until he was out of sight of the schoolhouse and 
out of breath; then he slowed to a walk. The vision became even stronger 
now. "I'll get her yet", 
he muttered to himself. "I've got to get her". That night he dreamed 
a dream violent with passion, in which he and the Woman, now the 
teacher, did everything except engage in the act (and this probably 
only because he had never engaged in the act in reality), and when he 
awoke the next morning his heart was afire.   He ate litle that 
morning, and his mother became concerned, inasmuch as he usually ate 
heartily.   "What's the matter, honey"? she said, with the 
solicitude of a middle-aged woman for her only child. "Aren't 
you hungry"?   "No, I'm not hungry", he said, pushing 
back the bacon and eggs. Outside it was already hot at 7:30 A&M&, 
and it was getting hot in the kitchen. He felt a little sick at 
his stomach.   "Are you sick"?   "No", he said. 
"I'll be all right. I guess it's this hot weather". 
"Don't you play hard today then. And if you get sick, ask the teacher 
to let you come home early. Daddy left the car for me, and I'm 
going to town this afternoon".   "O& K&, I won't 
play hard", he promised.   Just then Charles Lever yelled, "Hey, 
Jack", from the quarry road which ran behind the Carter house, 
and Jack grabbed the lunch from the table and darted out the kitchen 
door, yelling "Good-bye, Mom" over his shoulder.   "Whaddya 
say, boy"? Charles said, grinning, showing his huge yellow 
teeth. Charles, also fifteen, was tall and skinny, scraggly, with 
straight black hair like an Indian's and sharp brown eyes. He considered 
himself handsome and seemed to think all the girls were after him.

"You know what I done last night"? Charles said as 
they picked their way over the rocky road which led up the hill away 
from the Dixie Highway, through a corn field and a patch of woods to 
the school.   Jack knew of course that the tale to be unfolded 
would involve a girl and probably be dirty, because girls were Charles' 
only apparent interest. But Jack always derived vicarious sensual 
thrills from Charles' revelations (even when he suspected his friend 
of exaggeration or invention), so he usually invited them, as he 
did now. "No. What"?   "I got Margaret Rider in one 
of them old box cars down there by the quarry".   A nude imaginary 
picture of Miss Langford flashed across Jack's mind. His heart 
beat faster. "Hell you say"? he said, lapsing into the profanity 
he often used when away from his parents and especially when he 
was with Charles. "How'd you do it"?   "Hell, I jist 
got on top of-"   "No, I mean how'd you get <her> to 
do it"?   "Hell, I jist ask her".   "Jist like 
that"?   "Hell, yes. She's been hangin' around me 
a lot here lately, and I figgered I might as well's try it. Besides 
I heard her old uncle that stays there has been doin' it".
