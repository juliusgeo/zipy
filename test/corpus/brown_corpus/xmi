the governments to develop their own technical assistance to communities, 
state and provincial governments, rural communities, and other smaller 
groups, making certain that no important segment of the economy is 
neglected. Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships 
of technical progress in various fields, showing how agricultural 
training can be introduced into education, how health affects labor 
productivity, how small business can benefit the rural farm community, 
and, above all, how progress in each field relates to national progress. 
Efforts such as the Community Development Program in the Philippines 
have demonstrated that transitional societies can work toward 
balanced national development. To achieve this goal of balanced development, 
communications between the central government and the local communities 
must be such that the needs and aspirations of the people themselves 
are effectively taken into account. If modernization programs 
are imposed from above, without the understanding and cooperation of 
the people, they will encounter grave difficulties.   Land reform 
is likely to be a pressing issue in many of these countries. It should 
be American policy not only to encourage effective land reform 
programs but also to underline the relation of such reforms to the economic 
growth and modernization of the society. As an isolated policy, 
land reform is likely to be politically disruptive; as part of a larger 
development effort, however, it may gain wide acceptance. It should 
also be recognized that the problem of rural tenancy cannot be solved 
by administrative decrees alone. Land reform programs need to be 
supplemented with programs for promoting rural credits and technical assistance 
in agriculture.   Lastly, governmental and private planners 
will at this stage begin to see large capital requirements looming 
ahead. By holding out prospects for external capital assistance, the 
United States can provide strong incentives to prepare for the concerted 
economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth. 

#ACTIVELY 
MODERNIZING SOCIETIES#

At a third stage in the modernization 
process are such countries as India, Brazil, the Philippines, and 
Taiwan, which are ready and committed to move into the stage of self-sustaining 
growth. They must continue to satisfy basic capital needs; 
and there persists the dual problem of maintaining operational unity 
around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralizing 
participation in the program to wider and wider groups. 
But these countries have made big strides toward developing the necessary 
human and social overhead capital; they have established reasonably 
stable and effective governmental institutions at national and local 
levels; and they have begun to develop a capacity to deal realistically 
and simultaneously with all the major sectors of their economies.

On the economic front, the first priority of these countries 
is to mobilize a vastly increased volume of resources. Several related 
tasks must be carried out if self-sustaining growth is to be achieved. 
These countries must formulate a comprehensive, long-term program 
covering the objectives of both the private and the public sectors 
of the economy. They must in their planning be able to count on at least 
tentative commitments of foreign capital assistance over periods 
of several years. Capital imports drawn from a number of sources must 
be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment 
programming to go forward. Capital flows must be coordinated with 
national needs and planning. Finally, a balance must be effected among 
project finance, utilization of agricultural surpluses, and general 
balance of payments support.   Thus, although the agenda of external 
assistance in the economic sphere are cumulative, and many of the 
policies suggested for nations in the earlier stages remain relevant, 
the basic purpose of American economic policy during the later stages 
of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining 
growth is not prevented by lack of foreign exchange.

There remain many political and administrative problems to be solved. 
For one thing, although considerable numbers of men have been trained, 
bureaucracies are still deficient in many respects; even the 
famed Indian Civil Service is not fully adequate to the tremendous 
range of tasks it has undertaken. Technical assistance in training middle- 
and upper-level management personnel is still needed in many cases. 
There are also more basic problems. This is the stage at which democratic 
developments must take place if the society is to become an 
open community of creative people. Nevertheless, impulses still exist 
among the ruling elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need 
for centralized and authoritarian practices. Another great danger is 
that the emerging middle class will feel itself increasingly alienated 
from the political leaders who still justify their dominance by reference 
to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism. 
The capacity of intellectuals and members of the new professional 
classes to contribute creatively to national development is likely to 
be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority toward both their 
own political class and their colleagues and professional counterparts 
in the West. Particularly when based upon a single dominant party, 
governments may respond to such a situation by claiming a monopoly of 
understanding about the national interest. Convinced of the wisdom of 
their own actions, and reassured by the promises of their economic development 
programs, governments may fail to push outward to win more 
and more people to the national effort, becoming instead more rigid and 
inflexible in their policies.   American policy toward such societies 
should stress our sympathy for the emerging social and professional 
classes. It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation 
of professional standards and an understanding of the tremendous powers 
and potentialities of genuinely open and pluralistic societies. We 
have every obligation to take seriously their claims to being democratic 
and free countries; we also have, in consequence, the duty to appraise 
realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate 
our judgments to their leaders in frank but friendly ways. 

#THE TIME 
FACTOR#

We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society 
will take a considerable period of time. With the exception of 
treaty-making, foreign relations were historically concerned for the 
most part with conditions of short or at least measurable duration. Foreign 
policy now takes on a different perspective and must become skilled 
not merely at response but also at projection. American and free-world 
policies can marginally affect the pace of transition; but basically 
that pace depends on changes in the supply of resources and in 
the human attitudes, political institutions, and social structure which 
each society must generate. It follows that any effective policy toward 
the underdeveloped countries must have a realistically long working 
horizon. It must be marked by a patience and persistence which have 
not always been its trademark.   This condition affects not only 
the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign 
policy, especially in the context of economic aid. 
#/2,: SOME OF THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS OF RELIGION#

The place of 
religion in the simple, preliterate societies is quite definite; as 
a complex it fits into the whole social organization and functions dominantly 
in every part of it. In societies like ours, however, its place 
is less clear and more complex. With the diversity of religious viewpoints, 
there are differences of opinion as to the essential features 
of religion; and there are different opinions as to the essential 
functions of religion. Nevertheless, for most of the population of heterogeneous 
advanced societies, though less for the less religious portion, 
religion does perform certain modal individual and social functions.

Although the inner functions of religion are not of direct 
significance in social organization, they have important indirect consequences. 
If the inner functions of religion are performed, the individual 
is a composed, ordered, motivated, and emotionally secure associate; 
he is not greatly frustrated, and he is not anomic; he is 
better fitted to perform his social life among his fellows. There are 
several closely related inner functions.   In the last analysis, 
religion is the means of inducing, formulating, expressing, enhancing, 
implementing, and perpetuating man's deepest experience- the religious. 
Man is first religious; the instrumentalities follow. Religion 
seeks to satisfy human needs of great pertinence. The significant 
things in it, at the higher religious levels, are the inner emotional, 
mental, and spiritual occurrences that fill the pressing human needs 
of self-preservation, self-pacification, and self-completion. The chief 
experience is the sensing of communion, and in the higher religions, 
of a harmonious relationship with the supernatural power. Related to 
this is the fact that most of the higher religions define for the individual 
his place in the universe and give him a feeling that he is relatively 
secure in an ordered, dependable universe. Man has the experience 
of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand; 
he is a coordinate part of all of the mysterious energy and being and 
movement. The universe is a safe and permanent home.   A number 
of religions also satisfy for many the need of being linked with the 
ultimate and eternal. Death is not permanent defeat and disappearance; 
man has a second chance. He is not lost in the abyss of endless 
time; he has endless being. Religion at its best also offers the 
experience of spiritual fulfillment by inviting man into the highest realm 
of the spirit. Religion can summate, epitomize, relate, and conserve 
all the highest ideals and values- ethical, aesthetic, and religious- 
of man formed in his culture.   There is also the possibility, 
among higher religions, of experiencing consistent meaning in life 
and enjoying guidance and expansiveness. The kind of religious experience 
that most moderns seek not only provides, clarifies, and relates 
human yearnings, values, ideals, and purposes; it also provides facilities 
and incitements for the development of personality, sociality, 
and creativeness. Under the religious impulse, whether theistic or 
humanistic, men have joy in living; life leads somewhere. Religion 
at its best is out in front, ever beckoning and leading on, and, as Lippman 
put it, "mobilizing all man's scattered energies in one triumphant 
sense of his own infinite importance".   At the same 
time 
that religion binds the individual helpfully to the supernatural and 
gives him cosmic peace and a sense of supreme fulfillment, it also has 
great therapeutic value for him. It gives him aid, comfort, even solace, 
in meeting mundane life situations where his own unassisted practical 
knowledge and skill are felt by him to be inadequate. He is confronted 
with the recurrent crises, such as great natural catastrophes and 
the great transitions of life- marriage, incurable disease, widowhood, 
old age, the certainty of death. He has to cope with frustration 
and other emotional disturbance and anomie. His religious beliefs provide 
him with plausible explanations for many conditions which cause 
him great concern, and his religious faith makes possible fortitude, equanimity, 
and consolation, enabling him to endure colossal misfortune, 
fear, frustration, uncertainty, suffering, evil, and danger. Religion 
usually also includes a principle of compensation, mainly in a promised 
perfect future state.   The belief in immortality, where held, 
functions as a redress for the ills and disappointments of the here 
and now. The tensions accompanying a repressive consciousness of wrongdoing 
or sinning or some tormenting secret are relieved for the less 
self-contained or self-sufficient by confession, repentance, and penance. 
The feeling of individual inferiority, defeat, or humilation growing 
out of various social situations or individual deficiencies or failures 
is compensated for by communion in worship or prayer with a friendly, 
but all-victorious Father-God, as well as by sympathetic fellowship 
with others who share this faith, and by opportunities in religious 
acts for giving vent to emotions and energies.   In providing 
for these inner individual functions, religion undertakes in behalf 
of individual peace of mind and well-being services for which there is 
no other institution.   In addition to the functions of religion
