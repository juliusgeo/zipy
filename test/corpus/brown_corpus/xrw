come into the Navy too young, with the image of the fun-loving Guns 
Appleby before him. The war found him much too early, and its perils- 
and especially its awful boredom- were best forgotten in horseplay 
and elaborate practical jokes, and even now Doc had never found 
any stabilizing, sobering influence. He remained young at heart, with 
an overdeveloped sense of humor. He wisecracked about the captain's 
indoctrination of new men, took great delight in slaughtering cockroaches 
with ethyl chloride, and gave no thought for tomorrow. He was doing 
thirty years, and the Navy would take care of him. The job security 
enjoyed by Doc Doolittle, and nearly all members of the Armed 
Forces, is a wonderful thing. Actually, all a man in uniform has to 
do is to get by. He may not rise to the heights, but he can get by, and 
eventually be retired.   Doc had been under restriction to the 
ship since the <Bustard> left Subic. This deprived him of liberty 
in Hong Kong, but he told Boats McCafferty that Hong Kong was 
a book he had read before, and the Navy would always bring him there 
again, some day. At Yokosuka he was restricted to the confines of 
the Base because Walt Perry, being thoughtful, knew that Doc might 
have to draw some medical supplies from the hospital or the Supply 
Base. This gave Doc the whole range of the naval establishment, and 
suited him quite well. There were two things he wanted to do: inspect 
one of the many caves that had been dug into the hills on the Naval 
Base, and visit an old shipmate.   A telephone line had been 
hooked up to connect the ship with the Base exchange. After supper, 
Doc called Whitey Gresham, who was now a lieutenant and had a family.

"Well, Doc, you old sonofabitch"! Whitey exclaimed, 
with true affection. "Come over and have a drink. We live down by 
the Base commissary. Grab a taxi".   "I'll be there, but 
I'll walk", Doc said. "I've got to run an errand on the 
way. See you in about an hour".   He threw a smart salute at 
the gangway, went up the dock, and turned down the wide street in front 
of the Petty Officers' Club.

How, he wondered, does one enjoy one's spare time? He considered 
some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from 
dawn to dusk. Then there was exercise, boating and hiking, which was 
not only good for you but also made you more virile: the thought 
of strenuous activity left him exhausted. Perhaps golf, with a fashionable 
companion- but he'd lost his clubs, hadn't played in years. 
There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel, but his skin was 
so white he looked like the bottom of a frog. Perhaps a packing trip 
into the Sierras, let his beard grow- but that was too stark. I could, 
he thought, take a long walk- but where?   The telephone 
rang.   "You missed it", Buzz's voice said, "You should 
have gone over to the Pagan Room with us. Wow. Strippers, but 
scrumptious, and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band".

"Hi, Buzz", Owen said. "I went over to the Willows and dropped 
two notes".   "Tough", Buzz said, "Listen, we're 
having a stag dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday. Imagine 
a stag dinner with Toodle Williams". He laughed and laughed.

Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next 
to his, but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners. "Thanks", 
Owen said, "but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen".

Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims 
rest. When Owen was finally rid of him, there was a timid rap at the 
door.   "Yes", Owen called out. "Yes"?   "I'm 
Mrs& Gertrude Parker", a soft voice explained, "And I'd 
like to talk to you for a few minutes, please".   Ahah, he 
thought, a lush divorcee at last. Probably saw me in the lobby. He 
was disappointed to find a nervous, scrawny woman with a big hat standing 
at the door. She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons.

"How do you do"? she said, semi-professionally. "Our 
church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska. 
We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends 
and bringing the light. They're up there in that freezing climate 
and all of us have to try and help them".   "Oh"?

"You see", she said, looking past him into the room, where 
the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light, "you and I 
can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo". 
"Why is that"?   She apparently wasn't satisfied with 
his reaction. Smug, Owen thought, smug and sappy. There was a slight 
nervous twitch in the region of her left eye. It gave her a lewd, winking 
effect.   "Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo"? 
she asked, winking wildly. "They are a very difficult group 
of people".   "I don't know much about them", Owen admitted, 
"but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably 
resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not 
to do".   She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion. "You know, 
that's very interesting. People don't know how much they give 
away about themselves by remarks like that. The more canvassing I do, 
the more I note how far most people are from their personal God".

Forebearing, Owen kept his peace. What would happen next? 
That she was out for a touch was certain, but when did she get to the 
pitch? Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly 
retreated, trying to close the door a little, and she slowly leaned toward 
him and raised her voice.   "How did you get by the desk"? 
he asked curiously. "I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're 
wandering around the corridors, knocking on strangers' doors and 
talking down Eskimos".   "Oh, I just come once a week. 
Every day I visit a different hotel. I feel it's my duty. I do this 
work all on my own, because I understand the difficulties and I 
want to help these lay-sisters. Do you know these women go all through 
Alaska, and they don't have the proper facilities? They travel 
in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day".   "Do 
you have any idea how far I travel every day? I have the whole Pacific 
Northwest". Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he 
couldn't help himself.   Mrs& gertrude Parker drew back. 
"That's hardly a Christian approach", she remonstrated. "You're 
in the secular world".   "I didn't say it was Christian. 
I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen. 
Not that religion isn't big business; those bibles and prayer books 
make a lot of money for publishing houses, but they don't get top 
personnel. Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics".

"God, I take it, plays no part in this", she said waspishly.

"God doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics", he said 
heatedly before he caught himself. It sounded silly; why go on? 
More people were passing; he had to find some way to close this impossible 
conversation.   "And whiskey", she said, smiling and 
blinking at the highball glasses. "Don't forget whiskey; it's 
such a big seller".   "You know", he said, getting a grip 
on himself, "I think you're going to have to excuse me. I have 
an appointment".   "I can imagine", she said. "Probably 
down at the bar. But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters? 
They must be freezing up there now. Can't you help them"?

"Leave a card or something. I'll think it over".   "I 
have no card", she said bitterly. "You haven't been listening 
to what I've been telling you. I only hope my talking to you has 
helped you a little, anyway, because you need spiritual bucking-up". 
She looked crestfallen, as if he had somehow disappointed the whole 
human race. She stood indecisively for a moment, then walked down 
the hall; he heard her knocking on another door.   It took him 
about fifteen minutes to calm himself; then he realized he was hungry. 
He showered, shaved, dressed and went down to the dining room for 
breakfast. On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail. There 
was a check from his company, and the usual enthusiastic bulletins 
on new lines they always issued. His lawyer had sent him a statement 
on his overdue alimony, and there was a letter from the Collector 
of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last 
year's exemptions.   He ate breakfast in a sullen mood, but 
afterwards, when he walked out onto Virginia Street, he felt braced. 
He looked off to the crest of the Sierras, still white-topped; the 
glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle. He felt suddenly 
elated, adventurous. With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot.

Although it was only three o'clock, he stopped in 
at the Golden Calf. The tables were all spinning, the dice rattling, 
the bar crowded. Just to test himself, he played roulette for quarters 
on his old combination, five and seventeen, and within an hour, he 
had won, surprisingly, twenty dollars. The way was opening up; when 
the management brought around champagne, the breakfast settled its 
whirling around in his stomach.   The Golden Calf was dimly lit 
with shaded neon. There were more women than men in the place, but 
he couldn't find a flowerpot. They all had the hard look of gamblers 
who had stopped dreaming, who automatically turned the cards, hardly 
caring what showed up. The mural around the wall depicted early settlers 
in covered wagons, who appeared much more animated than the gamblers. 
The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from 
the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance, while the men were 
stern but hopeful. All, of course, except the Donner party who were 
bent on starving to death.   "I wonder if they did eat each 
other at the end", Owen mused.   He sat down next to a heavily-upholstered 
blonde, but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes. She 
sighed a dirty word and left. Owen was surprised to see Mrs& Gertrude 
Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged 
by the entrance. She sat down and played two slots at once, looking grim, 
as if bested by mechanical devices, and Owen felt sorry for the 
lay-sisters depending on her support.   A dried-up cowboy sat down 
next to him in the blonde's place. He was a little more authentic 
than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables. "What you 
need is a steady martingale", the cowboy announced after watching Owen 
play. "You can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen".

"What are you playing"? Owen asked.   "I'm 
just logging", the cowboy explained. "I keep all these plays in this 
little black book, and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find 
out what numbers are repeating. But roulette's not my game. I'm 
always 
trying to find a breaking table in blackjack. Incidentally, I'm 
pretty famous in these parts: I'm called The Wrangler".

"Nice to know you. Don't you have to spend any time on your 
ranch"?   "Well, of course I do. I'm with the 
Bar-~H, 
pushing a horse called Sparky. He's my own horse, and what 
I collect from him I use on blackjack. This Sparky can rack and single-foot 
and he's the fastest thing in Washoe County. I figure if 
I can get any kind of publicity campaign going, I'll land him on 
~TV- you know, one of those favorite horses for some Western hero. 
I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson, but nothing like Sparky. 
He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully".   Five came 
up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to 
play, a loss of ten dollars. This proved conclusively that The Wrangler 
was a jinx, so he walked on down to Hurrays, an even more glorified 
gambling den than the Golden Calf. When he looked in the back, 
Mrs& Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards.   His adventurous 
spirit had waned; he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays 
featured as an added attraction. He ogled a long redhead with green 
eyes, but she was a shill with her money in front of her. He had no 
great 
prejudice against shills; it just seemed such a dry run.
