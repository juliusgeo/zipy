Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption 
and social imbalances. In such conditions all freedoms are lost. 
This, in more diplomatic language, is what Adlai Stevenson told the 
newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States 
Government. He felt able to end on a note of hope. He sees evidence 
of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with 
its emphasis on social reforms. No group can contribute more to the 
success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-American 
Press Association. 

#MEETING IN MOSCOW#

The Twenty-second 
Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a 
situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago 
when this meeting was first announced. According to the original program, 
Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin 
this morning to be filled with admiration or rage- depending 
upon individual or national politics- because of the "bold program 
for building communism in our time" which the Congress will adopt. 
But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have 
achieved Utopia by 1980, the world is watching Moscow today primarily 
for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in 
the immediate future.   The evident contradiction between the rosy 
picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's 
program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier 
Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that 
the program may be severely altered. Whether it is or not, the propaganda 
impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted 
at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated. 
And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on 
and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised 
for 1980 they and their children must first survive.   This 
Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and 
laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness 
remove him from the scene in the next few years. The widespread purge 
that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist 
leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who 
will dominate the Congress, and the Central Committee it will elect, 
will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening, both 
for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job. 

#DR& CONANT'S CALL TO ACTION#

Dr& James B& Conant has 
earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer. 
His earlier reports considered the American public schools 
basically sound and not in need of drastic change. Now, a close look 
at the schools in and around the ten largest cities, including New York, 
has shattered this optimism. Dr& Conant has come away shocked 
and angry. His new book, entitled "Slums and Suburbs", calls for 
fast and drastic action to avert disaster.   There is room for 
disagreement concerning some of Dr& Conant's specific views. His 
strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside 
their own neighborhood, in the interest of integration, will be 
attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for, and achieved, this open 
or permissive enrollment. Dr& Conant may underestimate the psychological 
importance of even token equality.   His suggestion that 
the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical, 
law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges 
themselves- even though what he is recommending is already taking 
shape as a trend.   But these are side issues to a powerful 
central theme. That theme cuts through hypocrisies, complacency and 
double-talk. It labels the slums, especially the Negro slums, as dead-end 
streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters. The villains 
of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters, 
and Dr& Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike. The facts, 
he adds, are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling 
bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration 
rather than on real improvement of the schools, regardless of 
the color of their students.   A call for action "before it 
is too late" has alarming implications when it comes from a man who, 
in his 
previous reports on the schools, cautioned so strongly against extreme 
measures. These warnings must not be treated lightly. Dr& Conant's 
conscientious, selfless efforts deserve the nation's 
gratitude. 
He has served in positions of greater glamour, both at home and abroad; 
but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward 
report on the state of the public schools. 

#AND NOW- MORE JUNK MAIL#

A fascinating letter has just reached 
this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail. 
He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now 
going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives 
in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps, names, addresses 
or even zone numbers. In accordance with legislation passed 
at the last session of Congress, each Representative is authorized to 
deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters, speeches and other 
literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district. This means 
an added burden to innumerable postmen, who already are complaining 
of heavy loads and low pay, and it presumably means an increased postal 
deficit, but, our correspondent writes, think of the additional junk 
mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.

#OUR CREDITORS DO NOT FORGET US#

Letter writing is a dying 
art. Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and 
many are written by companies to one another, but these are mostly 
typewritten. Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly 
be called a letter.

Old, tired, trembling the woman came to the cannery. She had, 
she said, heard that the plant was closing. It couldn't close, she 
said. She had raised a calf, grown it beef-fat. She had, with her own 
work-weary hands, put seeds in the ground, watched them sprout, bud, 
blossom, and get ready to bear. She was ready to kill the beef, dress 
it out, and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup, broth, 
hash, and stew against the winter. She had done it last year, and 
the year before, and the year before that, and she, and her people 
were dependent upon these cans for food.   This did not happen in 
counties of North Georgia, where the rivers run and make rich the 
bottom land. Nor in South Georgia, where the summer sun shines warmly 
and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.

This happened in Decatur, DeKalb County, not 10 miles from the 
heart of metropolitian Atlanta.   And now, the woman, tired and 
trembling, came here to the DeKalb County cannery. "Is it so the 
cannery is going to close"?   O& N& Moss, 61, tall, 
grey as a possum, canning plant chief since 1946, didn't know what 
to say. He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this 
summer. He did say he was out of cans, the No& 3's, but "I requisitioned 
22,000". He said he had No& 2's enough to last two 
weeks more.   Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one. A 
three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles 
O& Emmerich that the DeKalb County cannery be closed. Reason: 
the cannery loses $3,000 yearly.   But DeKalb citizens, those 
who use the facilities of the cannery, say the cannery is not supposed 
to make any money.   "The cannery", said Mrs& Lewellyn 
Lundeen, an active booster of the cannery since its opening during 
the war and rationing years of 1941, to handle the "victory garden" 
produce, "is a service to the taxpayer. And one of the best services 
available to the people who try to raise and can meat, to plant, 
grow vegetables and put them up. It helps those people who help themselves.

"The county, though, seems more interested in those 
people who don't even try, those who sit and draw welfare checks and 
line up for surplus food".   A driver of a dairy truck, who 
begins work at 1 a&m& finishes before breakfast, then goes out and 
grows a garden, and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family 
of five, asked, "What in the world will we do"?   "What 
in the world", echoed others, those come with the beans, potatoes, 
the tomatoes, "will any of us do"?   Moss, a man who knows 
how much the cannery helps the county, doesn't believe it will close. 
But he is in the middle, an employe of DeKalb, but on the side 
of the people.   The young married people; the old couples. The 
dairy truck driver; the old woman with the stew.   "Don't 
ask me if I think the cannery helps", he said. "Sir, I know 
the cannery helps".

Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard. 
When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or 
hardship it is not always easy to say, "Just forget it". There 
is one thing I know; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner 
peace as long as the heart holds a grudge. I know a man who held 
resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades. Several years 
ago I was his pastor. One night, at the close of the evening service, 
he came forward, left his resentment at the altar and gave his 
heart to God. After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story 
of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on 
his land.   "We tried to settle this dispute", he said, "but 
could never come to an agreement. I settled it tonight", he continued. 
"I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has 
been lifted off my heart, I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven 
my neighbor".   Forgiveness is the door through which a 
person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God. You cannot wear the banner 
of God and at the same time harbor envy, jealousy and grudges in 
your heart. Henry van Dyke said, "Forgive and forget if you can; 
but forgive anyway".   Jesus made three things clear about 
forgiveness. We must, first of all, be willing to forgive others before 
we can secure God's forgiveness. "For if ye forgive men their 
trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if ye 
forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive 
your trespasses". Matthew 6:14-15. It will do no good to seek 
God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.

Then, Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited. 
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these 
words, "Forgive us our debts". When a person meets God's requirements 
for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven. God's mercy 
and patience will last forever. Forgiveness implies more than a person 
wanting his past sins covered by God's love. It also implies 
that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past. 
We want the past forgiven, but at the same time we must be willing for 
God to direct the future.   Finally, we must be willing to forgive 
others as many times as they sin against us. Once Peter asked, 
"How oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Till 
seven times? Jesus saith unto him, until seventy times seven". 
Matthew 18:21-22.   Jesus not only taught forgiveness, He 
gave us an example of it on the cross. With all the energy of his broken 
body he prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what 
they do". Luke 23:34.
