he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in 
any religious life at home. They have five daughters- Coral Lee, 
5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and Shari, five months.

But after that service, they decided to try to let the girls say 
grace at the table, have bedtime prayers, and Bible stories. To their 
surprise, the children all were eager and quite able to take part. 
Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without 
her. #@#

Enrique Jorda, conductor and musical director of the San Francisco 
Symphony, will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements 
in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary 
season, it was announced.   The guest assignments are 
scheduled 
for November 14 and 18, with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana 
in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne. The season in San 
Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22.

During his five-month visit abroad, Jorda recently conducted 
the Orchestre Philharmonique de Bordeau in France, and the Santa 
Cecilia Orchestra in Rome.   In announcing Jorda's return, 
the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 
50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on 
Wednesday.   Guest performers and conductors during the coming 
season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing 
with the orchestra, including violinists Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac 
Stern, Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel; pianists Leon Fleisher, 
Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard 
Murray.

The Leningrad Kirov Ballet, which opened a series of performances 
Friday night at the Opera House, is, I think, the finest "classical" 
ballet company I have ever seen, and the production of 
the Petipa-Tschaikowsky "Sleeping Beauty" with which it began 
the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of 
witnessing.   This work is no favorite of mine. I am prepared 
to demonstrate at an ytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial 
Russia in its most vulgar, infantile, and reactionary aspect; that 
its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates 
that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was; 
that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot 
to boobify the American people; that its choreography is undistinguished 
and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms. All 
of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of 
the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation. 

#PRECISE#

The reasons 
for this enchantment are numerous, but most of them end in "ova", 
"eva", or "aya". In other words, no merely male creature 
can resist that corps de ballet. It seems to have been chosen exclusively 
from the winners of beauty contests- Miss Omsk, Miss Pinsk, 
Miss Stalingr **h oops, skip it.   These qualities alone, 
however, would not account for their success, and it took me a while to 
discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective 
personality. It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address 
toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to 
the American ballet. Oh-the-pain-of-it, that convention of Russian 
ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters 
of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to thestage out of filial piety, 
is totally absent from the Kirov. This is all the more remarkable 
because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American 
politics. But, obviously, at least some things have changed for 
the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned.   Irina 
Kolpakova, the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance, would 
be a change for the better anywhere, at any time, no matter who had had 
the role before. She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes 
on, and her dancing has a feminine suavity, lightness, sparkle, and refinement 
which are simply incomparable.

Alla Sizova, who 
seems to have made a special hit in the East, was delightful as the lady 
Bluebird and her partner, Yuri Soloviev, was wonderfully 
virile, 
acrobatic, and poetic all at the same time, in a tradition not unlike 
that of Nijinsky. Vladilen Semenov, a fine "danseur noble"; 
Konstantin Shatilov, a great character dancer; and Inna Zubkovskaya, 
an excellent Lilac Fairy, were other outstanding members of the 
cast, but every member of the cast was magnificent.   The production, 
designed by Simon Virsaladze, was completely traditional but 
traditional in the right way. It was done with great taste, was big and 
spacious, sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes, 
but sumptuous in a muted, pastel-like style, with rich, quiet harmonies 
of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes 
and the scenery.   Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally 
large orchestra, one containing excellent soloists- the violin 
solos by the concertmaster, Guy Lumia, were especially fine- but one 
in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally 
had not had time to achieve much unity.

Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts 
to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber 
Music Society.   The season will open at the new Hall of 
Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p& m& with 
a concert by the Mills Chamber Players.   Sustaining members 
may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season; annual members 
may 
attend for $16. Participating members may attend five of the concerts 
for $9 (not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The 
Chronicle).   Mail orders for the season and orders for single 
tickets at $2, may be addressed to the society, 1044 Chestnut street, 
San Francisco 9.

San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their 
annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children.

Fire Fighters Local 798, which is sponsoring the toy program 
for the 12th straight year, issued a call for San Franciscans 
to turn in discarded toys, which will be repaired by off-duty firemen.

Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year. They will 
be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and 
Loan Association, at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown 
mall, and at the Junior Museum, 16th street and Roosevelt way.

From the collection centers, toys will be taken to a warehouse 
at 198 Second street, where they will be repaired and made ready 
for distribution.   Any needy family living in San Francisco can 
obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys, 676 Howard street, San 
Francisco 5, and listing the parent's name and address and the age 
and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12. Requests 
must be mailed in by December 5. 
Famed cellist Pablo Casals took his instrument to the East Room of 
the White House yesterday and charmed the staff with a two-hour rehearsal. 
He was getting the feel of the room for a concert tomorrow night 
for Puerto Rico Governor Luis Munoz Marin. President Kennedy's 
invitation to the Spanish-born master said, "We feel your 
performance as one of the world's greatest artists would lend distinction 
to the entertainment of our guests".

FOR A GOOD MANY SEASONS I've been looking at the naughty 
stuff on television, so the other night I thought I ought to see 
how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies. After 
all, this year's movies are next year's television shows.

So I went to see "La Dolce Vita".   <It has been billed 
as a towering monument to immorality. All the sins of ancient Rome 
are said to be collected into this three-hour film. If that's 
all the Romans did, it's a surprise to me that Rome fell>. 
After television, "La Dolce Vita" seems as harmless as a Gray 
Line tour of North Beach at night. I cannot imagine a single scene 
that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on ~TV every week.

I believe ~TV watchers will be bored.   <"La Dolce 
Vita" has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average 
~TV Western. Week in, week out, there is more sex to be seen 
in "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet". There is more decadence 
on "77 Sunset Strip". There are more obvious nymphomaniacs 
on any private-eye series>. #@#

{IN ANOTHER RESPECT}, 
television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors 
are unknowns. With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg, 
the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge 
Theater.   Most of the emphasis has been placed on a "wild 
party" at a seaside villa. Producer Fellini should have looked at 
some of the old silent films where they really had {PARTIES}! 
The Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease (carried as 
far as a black slip); a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries 
the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her 
face; a frigid beauty, and three silly fairies.   Put them all
