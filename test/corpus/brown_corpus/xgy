suspect in his trial-book essay? He wrote:   "The 
police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr& Morse as in 
possession of guilty knowledge. Neither had any interest in the deaths; 
indeed, it was probably to Mr& Morse's advantage to have 
Mr& and Mrs& Borden alive. Both he and Bridget were exonerated 
by Lizzie herself". That was his complete discussion of Bridget 
Sullivan as a possible suspect.   Although Pearson disbelieved 
almost everything Lizzie said, and read a sinister purpose into almost 
everything she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget 
as the whole truth. He felt nothing further need be said about the 
servant girl.   The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration, 
but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported in the 
testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet. This officer had asked Lizzie 
if she suspected her Uncle Morse, and she replied she didn't 
think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned 
after them. Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie 
pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her 
room 
before her father's murder and came down when she called her.

Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect. She told police about 
the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some 
weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of 
town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner. 
And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington, she also did not 
accuse him. At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew 
anybody her father had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings 
toward 
her father. She replied, "I know of one man that has not been 
friendly with him. They have not been friendly for years". Asked 
who this was, she named Harrington. Her statement certainly was true; 
the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview, 
but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the 
killer.   When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up pears 
in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in the household besides 
Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the 
murders. He said he had not heard of anybody else. "How about Bridget 
Sullivan"? I inquired. "Oh, she was just the maid there", 
he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant 
she was. Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed 
at the time of the murders.   Everyone somehow manages to overlook 
completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two 
people in and about the house at the time of both murders: Lizzie 
Borden and Bridget Sullivan.   All the officials on the case 
seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was 
concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of 
servants who have murdered their employers. True, it is no longer cricket 
for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing 
here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters 
and situations.   The actions of Bridget should be examined, 
since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her 
innocence. There are also other factors that require closer examination.

The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes 
the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the 
trial with a "big bundle" of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping 
her mouth shut. The people who believe and retell the legend have 
apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know 
that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to 
the detriment of Lizzie. If Bridget did get any bundles of cash, 
the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would 
have been Lizzie Borden.   Bridget was born in Ireland, one 
of fourteen children. She was apparently the pioneer in her family because 
she had no close relatives in this country at that time. She worked 
as a domestic, first in Newport for a year, and then in South 
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for another year. She finally settled in Fall 
River and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs& Reed, was 
hired by the Bordens.   I have previously described how, during 
the week of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing 
and ironing clothes. 
Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in 
the famous introduction to the <Scarlet Letter> as one of those who 
came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor 
of the port. A gentleman of the old school, Mr& Upton possessed 
intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a devoted Christian. 
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical 
subjects. Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad 
interests.   There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood 
had an unusual mind. She possessed an observant eye, a retentive memory, 
and a critical faculty. When she was nine years old, she wrote 
a description of a store she had visited. She named 48 items, and said 
there were "many more things which it would take too long to write". 
An essay on "Freedom" written at 10 years of age quoted the 
Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada, 
and the views of George Washington.   Lucy Upton was graduated 
from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and 
Elmira, were open to women; and she had an appetite for learning 
that could not be denied.   A picture of her in high school comes 
from a younger schoolmate, Albert S& Flint, friend of her brother 
Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer. He recalled 
Lucy, as "a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly 
through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little 
recitation room beyond". The study of Greek was the distinctive 
mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected 
to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men. 
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this. With four younger 
children at home, Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after 
the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's comfort 
and stay until he died in 1879. But even so Lucy could not give up 
her intellectual pursuits. When her brother Winslow became a student 
at Brown University in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history 
he was taking under Professor Diman: "What is Prof& Diman's 
definition of civilization, and take the world through, is its progress 
ever onward, or does it retrograde at times? Do you think I 
might profitably study some of the history you do, perhaps two weeks 
behind you **h". And that she proceeded to do.   Many years later 
(on August 3, 1915), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon 
to be graduated from Smith College: "While I love botany which, 
after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods 
of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating 
to take up zoology in the way you are doing. Whatever was the 
science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite 
study. Mathematics came next".   Her study of history 
was persistently pursued. She read Maitland's <Dark Ages>, "which 
I enjoyed very much"; La Croix on the <Customs of the Middle 
Ages>; 16 chapters of Bryce "and liked it more and more"; 
more chapters of Guizot; Lecky and Stanley's <Eastern Church>. 
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions 
that came to her as she studied alone.   Lucy's correspondence 
with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken 
up with academic studies. She played chess with him by postcard. 
Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could 
make the most words from the letters in "importunately". Who won 
is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 
1,212 words.   There was another family interest also. Winslow 
had musical talents, as had his father before him. At different times 
he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist. And it was 
Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music 
at Spelman College.   Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown 
University and two years of graduate study, accepted a position 
at the Harvard Observatory. For three years he was connected with 
the U&S& Naval Observatory and with the U&S& Signal Corps; 
and after 1883, was professor of astronomy at Brown University. 
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was 
a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as 
to the South Pacific and to Russia. After her father's death, Lucy 
and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington, 
D&C&. "Their house", writes Albert S& Flint, 
"was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful 
to one like myself far from home". Lucy was a lively part of the 
household. Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor. Winslow, 
as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize 
her as "our iron sister". There is reason to suppose that Lucy 
would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother 
had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about 
to enter college. As a matter of fact, Albert S& Flint expressed 
his conviction that "her physical strength, her mental power, her 
lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve 
her fellow beings" would have led her "to a distinguished career 
amongst the noted women of this country".   While in Washington, 
D&C&, Lucy Upton held positions in the U&S& Census 
Office, and in the Pension Bureau. They were not sufficiently challenging 
however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her 
brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study. After the 
months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church 
and community life.   What was called an "accidental meeting" 
with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman. 
Here was a cause she believed in. After correspondence with Miss 
Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came 
to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although 
there was then no money available to pay her a salary. She served for 
a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.

Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship 
and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students; 
of her "great power of discernment"; of "her exquisiteness 
of dress", "her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts 
of the hearers"; her great love of flowers and plants and birds; 
and her close knowledge of individual students.   She drew 
on all her resources of mind and heart to help them- to make them 
at home in the world; and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on 
her purse as well. Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only 
because of her unobtrusive help.   Under Miss Upton, the work 
of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption. After all, 
she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except 
for one year, Associate Principal or Dean. She had taught classes 
in botany, astronomy (with the aid of a telescope), geometry, 
and 
psychology.   Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact, 
had many tastes in common. Both had eager and inquiring minds; and 
both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the 
development of sturdy character and Christian zeal. Both loved the 
out-of-doors, including mountain climbing and horseback riding. In 1890 
when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss 
Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and "with rare 
executive ability" bore the brunt of "the entire pilgrimage from 
beginning to end". So strenuous it was physically, with its days of 
horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance 
for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton. Yet they thrived on 
it.   At the Fifteenth 
Anniversary (1896) as already quoted, Miss 
Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future 
as a college of first rank, with expanding and unlimited horizons. 
When Dr& Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined 
to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley 
(April 7, 1923) "**h If you had asked me, I think I would have 
suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton. Her services 
to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I 
have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her".
