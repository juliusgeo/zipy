with celerity".   This has always been Carl's attitude. 
Lloyd Lewis wrote that when he first knew Carl in 1916, Sandburg was 
making $27.50 a week writing features for the <Day Book> and eating 
sparse luncheons in one-arm restaurants. He walked home at night 
for two miles beyond the end of a suburban trolley.   When fame 
came it changed Sandburg only slightly. Lewis remembered another newspaperman 
asking, "Carl, have your ideas changed any since you got 
all these comforts"?   Carl thought the question over slowly 
and answered: "I know a starving man who is fed never remembers 
all the pangs of his starvation, I know that".   That was all 
he said, Lewis reports. That was all he had to say.   In answer 
to a <New York Times> query on what is fame ("Thoughts on 
Fame", October 23, 1960), Carl said: "Fame is a figment of a 
pigment. It comes and goes. It changes with every generation. There 
never were two fames alike. One fame is precious and luminous; another 
is a bubble of a bauble". #"AH, DID YOU ONCE SEE SHELLEY 
PLAIN"?#

The impression you get from Carl Sandburg's home is 
one of laughter and happiness; and the laughter and the happiness are 
even more pronounced when no company is present.   Carl has been 
married to Paula for fifty-three years, and he has not made a single 
major decision without careful consideration and thorough discussion 
with his wife. Through all these years, Mrs& Sandburg has pointedly 
avoided the limelight. She has shared her husband's greatness, 
but only within the confines of their home; it is a dedication which 
began the moment she met Carl.   Mrs& Sandburg received a 
Phi Beta Kappa key from the University of Chicago and she was busy 
writing and teaching when she met Sandburg. "You are the 'Peoples' 
Poet'" was her appraisal in 1908, and she stopped teaching 
and writing to devote herself to the fulfillment of her husband's 
career.   She has rarely been photographed with him and, except 
for Carl's seventy-fifth anniversary celebration in Chicago in 1953, 
she has not attended the dozens of banquets, functions, public appearances, 
and dinners honoring him- all of this upon her insistence. 
Even now I will not intrude upon her except to state a few bare facts.

The only way to describe Paula Sandburg is to say she is 
beautiful in a Grecian sense. Her clothes, her hair, everything about 
her is both graceful and simple. She has small, broad, capable hands 
and an enormous energy.   She is not only a trained mathematician 
and Classicist, but a good architect. She designed and supervised 
the building of the Harbert, Michigan, house, most of which was constructed 
by one local carpenter who carried the heavy beams singly upon 
his shoulder. As the Sandburg goat herd increased, she also designed 
the barn alterations to accommodate them. When erosion threatened 
the foundation of their home in Harbert, Paula Sandburg planted grapevines 
and arranged the snow fences which helped hold the sands away.

She was born Lilian Steichen, her parents immigrants from 
Luxemburg. Her mother called her Paus'l, a Luxemburg endearment 
meaning "pussycat". Some of the children of the family could not 
pronounce this name and called her Paula, a soubriquet Carl liked so 
much she has been Paula ever since.   But neither was Lilian 
her baptismal name. Her parents, pious Roman Catholics, christened 
her Mary Anne Elizabeth Magdalene Steichen. "My mother read a 
book right after I was born and there was a Lilian in the book she 
loved and I became Lilian- and eventually I became Paula".

Lilian Steichen was an exceptional student. This family of Luxemburg 
immigrants, in fact, produced two exceptional children. Paula's 
older brother is Edward Steichen, a talented artist and, for the 
past half-century, one of the world's eminent photographers. (Two 
years ago the photography editor of <Vogue> magazine titled his article 
about Steichen, "The World's Greatest Photographer".)

By the time Lilian had been graduated from public school, her 
parents were doing quite well. Her mother was a good manager and established 
a millinery business in Milwaukee. But her father was not enthusiastic 
about sending young Paula to high school. "This is no 
place for a young girl", he said. The parents compromised, however, 
on a convent school and Paula went to Ursuline Academy in London, 
Ontario.   She was pious, too, once kneeling through the night 
from Holy Thursday to Good Friday, despite the protest of the nuns 
that this was too much for a young girl. She knelt out of reverence 
for having read the <Meditations> of St& Augustine.   She 
read everything else she could get her hands on, including an article 
(she thinks it was in the <Atlantic Monthly>) by Mark Twain on 
"White Slavery". Paula was saddened about what was happening to 
little girls and vowed to kneel no more in Chapel. She had come to 
a decision. If there was ever a thought in her mind she might devote 
her life to religion, it was now dispelled. "I felt that I must devote 
myself to the 'outside' world".   She passed the entrance 
examinations to the University of Illinois, but during the year 
at Urbana felt more important events transpired at the University 
of Chicago.   "And besides, Thorstein Veblen was one of the 
Chicago professors".   At the University of Chicago she studied 
Whitman and Shelley, and became a Socialist. Socialist leaders 
in Milwaukee recognized her worth, not only because of her dedication 
but because of her fluency in German, French, and Luxemburg. She 
once gave a German recitation before a convention of German-language 
teachers in Milwaukee.   Carl and Paula met in Milwaukee 
in 1907 during Paula's Christmas holiday visit to her parents. Carl 
was still Charles A& Sandburg. He "legitimized" Paula for 
Lilian Steichen, and it was Paula who insisted on Carl for Charles.

Victor Berger, the panjandrum of Wisconsin Socialism and 
member of Congress, had asked Paula Steichen to translate some of 
his German editorials into English. Carl, who was stationed in Appleton, 
Wisconsin, organizing for the Social Democrats, was in Berger's 
office and made it his business to escort Paula to the streetcar. 
She left the next day for her teaching job at Princeton, Illinois. 
(After graduation from the University of Chicago, Paula taught 
for two years in the normal school at Valley City, North Dakota, 
then two years at Princeton (Illinois) Township High School.) By 
the time the streetcar pulled away, he had fallen in love with Paula.

A letter awaited her at Princeton. Paula says that even 
though Carl's letters usually began, "Dear Miss Steichen", there 
was an understanding from the beginning that they would become husband 
and wife.   Paula generously lent me one of Carl's love 
letters, dated February 21, 1908, Hotel Athearn, Oshkosh, Wisconsin:

"Dear Miss Steichen: It is a very good letter you 
send me- softens the intensity of this guerilla warfare I am carrying 
on up here. Never until in this work of ~S-~D organization 
have I realized and felt the attitude and experience of a <Teacher>.

The United States is always ready to participate with the Soviet 
Union in serious discussion of these or any other subjects that 
may lead to peace with justice.   Certainly it is not necessary 
to repeat that the United States has no intention of interfering in 
the internal affairs of any nation; by the same token, we reject any 
Soviet attempt to impose its system on us or other peoples by force 
or subversion.   Now this concern for the freedom of other peoples 
is the intellectual and spiritual cement which has allied us with 
more than forty other nations in a common defense effort. Not for a 
moment do we forget that our own fate is firmly fastened to that of these 
countries; we will not act in any way which would jeopardize our 
solemn commitments to them. ##

We and our friends are, of course, 
concerned with self-defense. Growing out of this concern is the realization 
that all people of the Free World have a great stake in the 
progress, in freedom, of the uncommitted and newly emerging nations. 
These peoples, desperately hoping to lift themselves to decent levels 
of living must not, by our neglect, be forced to seek help from, and 
finally become virtual satellites of, those who proclaim their hostility 
to freedom.   But they must have technical and investment assistance. 
This is a problem to be solved not by America alone, but also 
by every nation cherishing the same ideals and in position to provide 
help.   In recent years America's partners and friends in 
Western Europe and Japan have made great economic progress. 
The international economy of 1960 is markedly different from that of 
the early postwar years. No longer is the United States the only major 
industrial country capable of providing substantial amounts of the 
resources so urgently needed in the newly developed countries.

To remain secure and prosperous themselves, wealthy nations must extend 
the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate members that will 
inspire hope, confidence, and progress. A rich nation can for a time, 
without noticeable damage to itself, pursue a course of self-indulgence, 
making its single goal the material ease and comfort of its own citizens- 
thus repudiating its own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful 
and prosperous society of nations. But the enmities it will incur, 
the isolation into which it will descend, and the internal moral 
and spiritual softness that will be engendered, will, in the long term, 
bring it to economic and political disaster.   America did not 
become great through softness and self-indulgence. Her miraculous progress 
in material achievements flows from other qualities far more worthy 
and substantial: adherence to principles and methods consonant 
with our religious philosophy; a satisfaction in hard work; the readiness 
to sacrifice for worthwhile causes; the courage to meet every 
challenge; the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the 
true path of her own best interests.   To us and to every nation 
of the Free World, rich or poor, these qualities are necessary today 
as never before if we are to march together to greater security, prosperity 
and peace.   I believe that the industrial countries are 
ready to participate actively in supplementing the efforts of the developing 
nations to achieve progress.   The immediate need for 
this kind of co-operation is underscored by the strain in this nation's 
international balance of payments. Our surplus from foreign business 
transactions has in recent years fallen substantially short of the 
expenditures we make abroad to maintain our military establishments overseas, 
to finance private investment, and to provide assistance to the 
less developed nations. In 1959 our deficit in balance of payments 
approached four billion dollars.   Continuing deficits of anything 
like this magnitude would, over time, impair our own economic growth 
and check the forward progress of the Free World.   We must 
meet this situation by promoting a rising volume of exports and world 
trade. Further, we must induce all industrialized nations of the Free 
World to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less 
fortunate. This co-operation in this matter will provide both for 
the necessary sharing of this burden and in bringing about still further 
increases in mutually profitable trade.   New Nations, and 
others struggling with the problems of development, will progress only- 
regardless of any outside help- if they demonstrate faith in their 
own destiny and use their own resources to fulfill it. Moreover, 
progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earned; 
there is no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane. 
But, just as we drew on Europe for assistance in our earlier years, 
so now do these new and emerging nations that do have this faith 
and determination deserve help.   Respecting their need, one of 
the major focal points of our concern is the South-Asian region. 
Here, 
in two nations alone, are almost five hundred million people, all working, 
and working hard, to raise their standards, and in doing so, to 
make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology 
that would destroy liberty.   I cannot express to you the depth 
of my conviction that, in our own and free world interest, we must co-operate
