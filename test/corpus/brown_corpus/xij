
#PROPRIETORSHIP#

Avoiding runaway 
technology can be done only by assuring a humane society; and for this 
human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our 
society rests. Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can 
offer, corporations cannot. It can project long-range goals for itself. 
Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli, e& g&, 
quarterly and annual dividend reports. Proprietorships can establish 
a unity and integrity of control; corporations, being more amorphous, 
cannot. Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity, representing 
a human personality, and thus establish sincere relationships with 
customers and community. Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal, 
inhumane, shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated, 
a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public. The 
proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate 
structure with its board of directors and stockholders. Leadership is 
lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop. 
Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences 
of the most varied, complicated and trying type so that at maturation 
they have developed the competence and willingness to accept 
the personal responsibility so sorely needed now.   Hence government 
must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their 
activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest. 
Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations, 
e& g& the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth. 
Corporations should pay added taxes, to be used for educational purposes 
(not necessarily of the formal type). The right to leave legacies 
should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated. To perpetuate 
wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no 
role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to 
the fore, and is basically anti-democratic. When the proprietor dies, 
the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired 
by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it. Strikes 
should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements 
would have to be settled by government representatives acting as 
controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would 
now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors 
must be completely interdependent, as they are each a part of the 
whole. Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship, if internally 
motivated, prevent a healthy relationship. Certainly external 
forces 
should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to 
do so. <If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system, how can 
we expect to abolish it internationally?> 

#ONE KIND OF PROPRIETORSHIP# 

These proposals would go far toward creating the economic 
atmosphere favoring growth of the individual, who, in turn, would help 
us to cope with runaway technology. Individual <human> strength is 
needed to pit against an inhuman condition. The battle is not easy. 
We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them 
straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible 
of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed, 
enlightened, competent leaders. Persons developed in to-day's corporations 
cannot hope to serve here- a judgment based on experiences 
of my own in business and in activities outside. In my own company, in 
effect a partnership, although legally a corporation, I have been able 
to do many things for my employees which "normal" corporations 
of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do. Also, I 
am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of 
a partnership, I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems 
for myself and my fellow-employees. Any abilities I may have were 
achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the 
growth and control of my business, coupled with raising my family. This 
combined experience, on a foundation of very average, I assure you, 
intelligence and background, has helped me do things many well-informed 
people would bet heavily against. Perhaps a list of some of the "practices" 
of my company will help here.   The company grew 
out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties, 
neither having a formal education applicable to, or experience in, 
manufacturing or selling our type of articles. From an initial investment 
of $1,200 in 1943, it has grown, with no additional capital investment, 
to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 
(<we> don't disclose financial figures to the public). Its growth 
continues steadily on a par with past growth; and no limitation is 
in evidence. Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance 
in just a few years time, despite substantial, well established competition.

DURING the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration, 
a red scare developed in our country. Many Americans reacted irrationally 
to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of 
ideas by force. Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the 
American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through 
the mails. Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that 
sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails, in direct violation 
of their constitutional rights. Then, not many years later, the 
Un-American Activities Committee, under the leadership of Martin 
Dies, pilloried hundreds of decent, patriotic citizens. Anyone who 
tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy 
was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction 
of our government. This hysteria reached its height under the 
leadership of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Demagogues of this sort found 
communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter 
to stereotyped notions. New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed, 
no matter how.   Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts, 
credit ideas with high potency. They give strict interpretation to 
William James' statement that "Every idea that enters the mind 
tends to express itself". They seem to believe that a person will 
act automatically as soon as he contacts something new. Hence, the only 
defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion, unless it 
gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.   Despite this danger, 
however, we are informed on every hand that ideas, not machines, are 
our finest tools; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded 
on a ledger page; they are the most valuable of commodities- 
and the most salable, for their demand far exceeds supply. So all-important 
are ideas, we are told, that persons successful in business and 
happy in social life usually fall into two classes: those who invent 
new ideas of their own, and those who borrow, beg, or steal from others.

Seemingly, with an unrestricted flow of ideas, all will 
be well, and we are even assured that "an idea a day will keep the sheriff 
away". That, however, may also bring the police, if the thinking 
does not meet with social approval. Criminals, as well as model 
citizens, exercise their minds. Merely having a mental image of some 
sort is not the all-important consideration.   Of course, there 
must be clarity: a single distinct impression is more valuable than 
many fuzzy ones. But clarity is not enough. The writer took a class 
of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St& 
Joseph, Missouri. An inmate, a former university professor, expounded 
to us, logically and clearly, that someone was pilfering his thoughts. 
He appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities 
that justice might be done. Despite the clarity of his presentation, 
his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre.   True, ideas 
are important, perhaps life's most precious treasures. But have we 
not gone overboard in stressing their significance? Have we not actually 
developed idea worship?   Ideas we must have, and we seek 
them everywhere. We scour literature for them; here we find stored 
the wisdom of great minds. But are all these works worthy of consideration? 
Can they stand rigid scrutiny?   Shakespeare's 
wit and wisdom, his profound insight into human nature, have stood the 
test of centuries. But was he infallible in all things? What of 
his treatment of the Jew in <The Merchant of Venice?> 
Shakespeare 
gives us a vivid picture of Shylock, but probably he never saw a 
Jew, unless in some of his travels. The Jews had been banished from 
England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655, when 
Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years. If any had escaped 
expulsion by hiding, they certainly would not frequent the market-place.

Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays, 
but borrowed them from old stories, ballads, and plays, wove them 
together, and then breathed into them his spark of life. Rather than 
from a first-hand study of Jewish people, his delineation of Shylock 
stems from a collection of Italian stories, <Il Pecorone>, published 
in 1558, 
although written almost two centuries earlier. He could 
learn at second hand from books, but could not thus capture the real 
Jewish spirit. Harris J& Griston, in <Shaking The Dust From 
Shakespeare> (216), writes: "There is not a word spoken by Shylock 
which one would expect from a real Jew".   He took the 
story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone. The Jew 
was the safest victim. No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially 
struggling theater. It would have been unwise policy, for instance, 
to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman. 
Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars, or even 
of Tikopia, and no senatorial investigation will result. Who cares 
about them!   Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an 
aberrant individual. He sets him forth as being typical of the group. 
He tells of his "Jewish heart"- not a Shylockian heart; 
but a Jewish heart. This would make anyone crafty and cruel, capable 
of fiendish revenge.   There is no justification for such misrepresentation. 
If living Jews were unavailable for study, the Bible 
was at hand. Reading the Old Testament would have shown the dramatist 
that the ideas attributed to Shylock were abhorrent to the Jews.

Are we better off for having Shakespeare's idea of Shylock? 
Studying <The Merchant of Venice> in high school and college 
has given many young people their notions about Jews. Does this help 
the non-Jew to understand this group?   Thomas de Torquemada, 
Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition, put many persons 
to death. His name became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty. Would 
we gain by keeping alive his memory and besmirching today's Roman 
Catholics by saying he had a Catholic heart? Let his bones and 
his memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong; he is 
out of place in our times. Shakespeare's Shylock, too, is of dubious 
value in the modern world.   Ideas, in and of themselves, are 
not necessarily the greatest good. A successful businessman recently 
prefaced his address to a luncheon group with the statement that all 
economists should be sent to the hospitals for the mentally deranged where 
they and their theories might rot together. Will his words come 
to be treasured and quoted through the years?   Frequently we 
are given assurance that automatically all ideas will be sifted and resifted 
and in the end only the good ones will survive. But is that not 
like going to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pouring out liquids 
and powders from an array of bottles and then, after stirring, expecting 
a new wonder drug inevitably to result?   What of the efficiency 
of this natural instrument of free discussion? Is there some 
magic in it that assures results?   When Peter B& Kyne 
(<Pride of Palomar>, 43) informed us in 1921 that we had an <instinctive> 
dislike for the Japanese, did the heated debates of the Californians 
settle the truth or falsity of the proposition?   <The 
Leopard's Spots> came from the pen of Thomas Dixon in 1902, 
and in this he announced an "unchangeable" law. If a child had 
a single drop of Negro blood, he would revert to the ancestral line which, 
except as slaves under a superior race, had not made one step of 
progress in 3,000 years. That doctrine has been accepted by many, but 
has it produced good results?   In the same vein, a certain
