determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction 
of the United States in a case before the World Court to which 
the United States is a party. If the case is thus determined by us 
to be domestic, the court has no jurisdiction.   Since the Connally 
amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other 
party to a dispute with the United States, it also prevents us from 
using the court effectively. Yet although the Kennedy Administration, 
and the Eisenhower Administration before it, have both declared themselves 
solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment, as contrary to 
our best interests, no action has yet been taken.   Our "destiny" 
in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit 
of peace, with justice, under law. To achieve this destiny, acts 
as well as words are needed- not only acts that lead to physical strength 
but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.

What better affirmative step could be taken to this end 
than repeal of the Connally amendment- an act which could expose 
the 
United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging 
attitude toward the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance 
in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?

We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the 
Eighty-seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate 
of the Connally amendment. @ 

#FOR BETTER SUBWAY SERVICES#


_TO 
THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ Many home-bound subway riders 
utilizing the Flushing-Main Street express are daily confronted with 
the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their 
express comes to a stop, leaving them stranded and strained. To the 
tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth Street 
and change for the ~IND, this takes a daily toll of time and temper.

The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation 
"hold" lights at ~BMT Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Street 
stations in Brooklyn. This "holds" the local until the express 
passengers change trains. Without question, this time and temper saver 
should be immediately installed at the Woodside station. @ 

#PHONE 
SERVICE CRITICIZED#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:_ 
As a business man I have to use the telephone constantly, from three 
to four hours a day.   In the last few years the telephone company 
has managed to automate many areas of their service. It has not 
been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization 
which has brought about new ways of dialing.   However, there 
are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone 
operators. I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the 
young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls, special long-distance 
calls, etc&. Either it is lack of training, lack of proper 
screening when hiring, lack of management or possibly lack of interest 
on the part of the telephone company, which does have a Government-blessed 
monopoly. 

#FAIR-PRICED FUNERAL#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ I disagree with the 
writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled. 
The funeral 
for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price, far 
less than I had expected to pay. But the hospitals and doctors should 
be. @ 

#HELPING RETARDED CHILDREN#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ Recently 
I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School for retarded children.

Hazel Park donates its recreation center, five days a 
week, to the school. There is no charge and no state aid. Kiwanis, 
American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do 
what they can to bring in dollars for its support.   There are 
70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school. 
Reading, writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts 
as working in brass. They make beautiful objects.   Enough 
trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon. Southfield 
schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus (the heater in which 
needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need 
the heat).   The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile road, Woodward 
Heights. Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated 
mothers can do. @ 

#JOBS FOR CAVANAGH#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ I 
was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat, but perhaps Mayor-elect 
Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years 
ago. Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city 
departments such as welfare, ~DPW and sanitation. Negligence in 
garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.   He 
should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at 
night. There should be better bus service and all of our city departments 
and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling.

Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to 
read of a conviction in a littering case.   Drunken truck drivers 
in the city departments should be weeded out. Educate the city employes 
to give real service to the public. After all, they are paid by 
the public, they should be examples. @ 

#CHURCH FINDS NEWS FEATURES 
ARE HELPFUL#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ At a recent meeting of the Women's 
Association of the Trumbull Ave& United Presbyterian 
Church, considerable use was made of material from The Detroit News 
on the King James version of the New Testament versus the New English 
Bible.   Some members of the organization called attention 
also to the article on hymns of inspiration, the Daily Prayer and 
Three Minutes a Day, as being very helpful.   We feel that 
The Detroit News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles 
on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material 
along wholesome lines. @ 

#RUDE YOUNGSTERS#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ 
Thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy 
to impudence.   How old do you have to be to remember when Americans, 
especially children, were encouraged to be polite? Why has 
this form of gentility gone out of American life?   How can 
we old-fashioned parents, who still feel that adults are due some respect 
from children, battle the new type of advertising that appears on 
~TV without denying the children the use of television entirely? 
Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of "modern" 
parents they have observed. From necessity, they are also inspired 
by the "hard-sell" attitude of the sponsor, so, finally, it 
is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste 
of his advertising. @ 

#DUNES PARK ADVOCATE#


_TO THE EDITOR:_ 
I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish a national 
park in the dunes area. 

#GHOST TOWN?#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ I just wish 
to 
congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in 
cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles. We have now a quiet 
city, fewer automobiles, less congestion, and fewer retail customers shopping 
in center city. Good for Mr& Trimmer. Maybe he will help 
to turn our fair city into a "ghost" town. @ 

#DEFENDS BIG TRUCKS# 


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ I worked on the Schuylkill 
Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock 
and concrete there wouldn't be an Expressway. Without these massive 
trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future. 
Mr& George Hough (Oct& 30) sounds like a business man who waits 
until the last minute to leave his home or shop. The trucks today 
help pay for this highway. They try to keep within the speed limits. 
Although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars, a truck driver 
has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road. @ 

#OUT OF SCHOOL AT 14#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE INQUIRER:_ The 
letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school 
at 14 should have signed his letter "SIMPLETON" instead of 
"SIMPLICITUDE". Such kids only wind up among the unemployed 
on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden. There are 
lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates, but not for 
the dropouts. What we need is more vocational training in high schools, 
not more dropouts. @ 

#TWO WRONGS#


_TO THE EDITOR OF THE 
INQUIRER:_ I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly 
cannot see how two wrongs can make a right! I am referring 
to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because 
Russia is. Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less 
harmful to future generations of children? If an atom bomb in 1945 
could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have 
is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it.

As I see it, if war starts and we survive the initial attack 
enough to be able to fight back, the nuclear weapons we now have- 
at least the bombs- can inflict all the demage that is necessary. Why
