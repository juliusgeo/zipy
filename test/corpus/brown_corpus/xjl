much as a single word out of him. Preoccupied with his own defense and 
his attempts to get Robinson to fight, Pike lessened his attacks 
on Woodruff, and finally stopped them altogether. And Pike never did 
find out if Robinson was really responsible for the "Vale" letter. 
Woodruff's strategy had been immensely successful.   It 
took Pike a long time to realize what Woodruff had done, and it had 
a profound effect on him. Once he learned a lesson, he never forgot it. 
In the next few months of comparative silence, Pike waited patiently 
until conditions were perfect for a new attack, and then, displaying 
a remarkable grasp of the subtleties of political infighting, gained 
from his first bout with Woodruff, he used these changed conditions 
to excellent advantage.   Shortly after the "Vale" incident, 
a rift began to develop between William Woodruff and Governor Pope. 
One-armed, gruff, frugally honest, Governor Pope had been the 
ideal man to assume office in Arkansas after the disgraceful antics of 
political bosses like Crittenden, and he ruled the state with an iron 
fist, tolerating no nonsense. Woodruff had supported him all the way, 
both as a chief executive and as a man. Besides being political allies, 
they were also friends. This warm relationship came to an abrupt 
end in June of 1834 when the National Congress appropriated $3,000 
for compiling and printing the laws of Arkansas Territory, and, 
taking note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature, left 
it to the governor to award the contract.   Woodruff wanted this 
political windfall very badly, and everyone assumed that he would get 
it because he was a close friend of the governor and his stanchest supporter. 
After all, Woodruff owned a competent printing plant and was 
the logical man for the job. But because the governor was determined 
that friendship should not influence him one way or the other, he looked 
for a printer with a knowledge of the law (which Woodruff did not 
have), and awarded the contract to a lawyer named John Steele who 
had started a newspaper in Helena the year before.   Woodruff was 
furious. Considering the governor's act a personal rebuff, he aired 
his feelings in the <Gazette> on August 26, 1834: "We think 
the governor treated us rather shabbily, to say the least of it. **h 
It is but justice to Mr& Steele for us to add that, in the above 
remarks, nothing is intended to his disparagement, either as a lawyer 
or as a printer. He got a good fat job and we congratulate him on his 
good luck. We hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle 
him to credit".   As summer cooled into fall and winter, 
even so the relationship between the two men continued to grow colder 
by the day, and by December of 1834 it was icy. It was at this point 
that Pike decided to capitalize on the bad feelings between the two 
men. The eventual prize in this new battle was the public printing contract 
that Woodruff still held.   From his first bout with the 
canny Woodruff, Pike had learned that it was better not to attack him 
directly, so, harping on the theme that the cost of printing was too 
high, he condemned the governor for permitting such a state of affairs 
to exist. To document his charge, Pike set up two parallel columns 
in the <Advocate> showing the price charged by the <Gazette> and 
the considerably lower price for which the work could be done elsewhere. 
Then he called on the governor to explain why.   The governor 
was not used to having his integrity questioned, and he promptly 
passed the charges on to Woodruff, demanding that Woodruff answer them. 
If Woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation, the governor 
insisted that he lower his prices in accord with the scale printed in 
the <Advocate>. Woodruff was now impaled on the horns of a dilemma. 
As a proud man, his prestige would suffer if he let Pike dictate 
to him through the governor's office, but to lower his prices would 
be tantamount to an admission that they had been too high in the first 
place. As a consequence, he did neither. Very angry at Woodruff, 
the governor used his personal influence to have the printing contract 
withdrawn from the <Gazette> and awarded to the lowest bidder, which, 
by a strange coincidence, happened to be Pike's <Advocate>. 
And, for the moment at least, the governor now found himself allied with 
the head of the Crittenden faction he had formerly opposed, and Pike 
was credited with a clear triumph over Woodruff.   But in 
the 
confused atmosphere of frontier politics, alliances were as quickly 
broken as they were formed, and as Pike came to favor with the governor 
of the Territory, the governor fell out of favor with the President 
of the United States. On January 28, 1835, Andrew Jackson removed 
Pope from office and elevated Territorial Secretary William 
S& Fulton to the position. Fulton was a very close friend of Jackson, 
and had been his private secretary for a number of years in the 
old days. As a stanch party man and a rabid Democrat, he had little 
tolerance for Whigs like Pike, and Pike lost any immediate personal 
advantage his victory over Woodruff might have gained him.

As Pike proved himself adept in the political arena, he also became 
a social lion in the village of Little Rock, where he served as a symbol 
of the culture that the ladies of the town were striving so eagerly 
to cultivate. After all, Pike was an established poet and his work 
had been published in the respectable periodicals of that center of 
American culture, Boston. His accomplishments, and the fact that he 
was resident, did much to offset the unkind words travelers used to 
describe Little Rock after a visit there. For some reason, none of 
them were impressed with the territorial capital. The internationally 
known sportsman and traveler Friedrich Gersta^cker was typical of 
its detractors in the mid-thirties. "Little Rock is a vile, detestable 
place **h". he wrote. "Little Rock is, without any flattery, 
one of the dullest towns in the United States and I would not have 
remained two hours in the place, if I had not met with some good friends 
who made me forget its dreariness".   Pike enjoyed his 
new social position tremendously, and cultivated in himself those traits 
necessary to its preservation. He was especially popular with women, 
for, like the romantic poetry he wrote, he was personally gracious, 
gallant, and chivalrous. He again began to play the violin, and tucking 
the instrument beneath his chin, performed soulful and romantic airs 
to match the expressions on the faces of the lovely women who gathered 
to hear him. His artistic accomplishments guaranteed him entry into 
any social gathering. He composed songs and set them to music and 
sang them in a soft, melodious voice, and when his audience had had enough 
of music he would discourse on politics or tell stories of his western 
adventures guaranteed to excite the emotions of men and women alike.

The bulk of his early reputation, however, came not from 
his poetry or his music, but from his excellence as an orator. By 1834 
the art of oratory had reached a very high level in the United States 
as a literary form. The orator of this period, in order to earn a 
reputation, had to pay close attention to the formal composition of his 
speech, judging how it would appear in print as well as the effect 
it would have on the audience that heard it.   Very soon after his 
arrival in Little Rock, Pike had joined one of the most influential 
organizations in town, the Little Rock Debating Society, and it 
was with this group that he made his debut as an orator, being invited 
to deliver the annual Fourth of July address the club sponsored every 
year. 
SAMUEL GORTON, founder of Warwick, was styled by the historian 
Samuel Greene Arnold "one of the most remarkable men who ever lived". 
A biographer called him "the premature John the Baptist of 
New England Transcendentalism". The historian Charles Francis 
Adams called him "a crude and half-crazy thinker". His contemporaries 
in Massachusetts called him an arch-heretic, a beast, a miscreant, 
a proud and pestilent seducer, a prodigious minter of exorbitant 
novelties. Edward Rawson, secretary of the colony of Massachusetts 
Bay, described him as "a man whose spirit was stark drunk with blasphemies 
and insolence, a corrupter of the truth, a disturber of the peace 
wherever he comes". Nathaniel Morton stated he "was deeply leavened 
with blasphemous and familistical opinions". He was thrown 
out, more or less, from Boston, Plymouth, Pocasset, Newport, and Providence.

On the other hand, Dr& Ezra Styles recorded the 
following testimony of John Angell, the last disciple of Gorton: 
"  He said Gorton was a holy man; wept day and night for 
the sins and blindness of the world **h had a long walk through the trees 
and woods by his house, where he constantly walked morning and evening, 
and even in the depths of the night, alone by himself, for contemplation 
and the enjoyment of the dispensation of light. He was universally 
beloved by his neighbours, and the Indians, who esteemed him, 
not only as a friend, but one high in communion with God in Heaven". 
Gorton sometimes signed himself "a professor of the mysteries of 
Christ".   There is plenty more to recommend Gorton, the facts 
of whose life are given in <The Life and Times of Samuel Gorton,> 
by Adelos Gorton. He fought like a fiend for the helpless and 
oppressed, worked for the abolition of slavery, helped the Quakers 
and Indians, and worked against the prosecution of witches. He defied 
the Boston hierarchy, and after they sent a small army to get him 
he befuddled the court, including John Cotton, with one of the most 
complicated religious discourses ever heard.   Samuel Gorton was 
born at Gorton, England, near the present city of Manchester, about 
1592. Although he did not attend any celebrated schools or universities, 
he was a master of Greek and Hebrew and could read the Bible 
in the original. He worked as a "clothier" in London, but was greatly 
concerned with religion.   Gorton left England, he said, 
"to enjoy libertie of conscience in respect to faith towards God, 
and for no other end". With his wife and three or more children he 
arrived in Boston in March, 1637, and soon found it was no place for 
anyone looking for liberty of conscience. Roger Williams had recently 
been thrown out, and Anne Hutchinson and her Antinomians were slugging 
it out with the powers-that-be. Gorton and his family moved to 
Plymouth.   Soon he was in trouble there, for defending a woman 
who was accused of smiling in church. She was Ellen Aldridge, a widow 
of good repute who was employed by Gorton's wife and lived with 
the family. The report was: "  It had been whispered privately 
that she had smiled in the congregation, and the Governor Prence 
sent to knoe her business, and command, after punishment as the bench 
see fit, her departure and also anyone who brought her "to the place 
from which she came"". Gorton said they were preparing to deport 
her as a vagabond, and to escape the shame she fled to the woods for 
several days, returning at night. He advised the poor woman not to 
appear in court as what she was charged with was not in violation of 
law. Gorton appeared for her, however, and what he told the magistrates 
must have been plenty, for he was charged with deluding the court, 
fined, and told to leave the colony within fourteen days. He left in 
a storm for Pocasset, December 4, 1638. His wife was in delicate health 
and nursing an infant with measles.   The unconquerable Mrs& 
Hutchinson was residing at Pocasset, after having been excommunicated 
by the Boston church and thrown out of the colony. One can imagine 
that with her and Gorton there it was no place for anyone with 
weak nerves. William Coddington, who was running the colony, felt constrained 
to move seven miles south where, with others- as mentioned 
above- he founded Newport. When, in March, 1640, the two towns 
were united under Coddington, Gorton claimed the union was irregular 
and illegally constituted and that it had never been sanctioned by the 
majority of freeholders.   Then he became involved in a ruckus 
remarkably similar to the one in Plymouth. A cow owned by an old woman 
trespassed on Gorton's land. While driving the cow back home the 
woman was assaulted by a servant maid of Gorton. The old woman complained 
to the deputy governor, who ordered the servant brought before 
the court. Gorton reverted to his Plymouth tactics, refused to let 
her go, and appeared himself before the Portsmouth grand jury. During 
the trial he told off the jury, called them "Just Asses" and 
called a freeman "a saucy boy and Jack-an-Apes". He was jailed 
and banished.   Gorton then moved to Providence and soon put the 
town in a turmoil. He held that no group of colonists could set up 
or maintain a government without royal sanction. Since Rhode Island 
at that time did not have such sanction, his opinion was not popular. 
Roger Williams wrote his friend Winthrop as follows: "  Master
