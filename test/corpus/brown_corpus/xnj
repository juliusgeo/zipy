as they see it.   In general it appears that educational decisions 
and educational policies are made by people who intend to act in the 
interests of the society as a whole. They are predominantly middle- 
and upper-class people, and undoubtedly share the values and attitudes 
of those classes. They may be unaware of the existence of lower-class 
values and consequently fail to take them into account. But there 
is very little frank and conscious espousal of the interests of any one 
social class by the people who have the power to make decisions in education. 
They think of themselves as trustees for the entire society 
and try to serve the entire society. 

#ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE SOCIAL 
STRUCTURE THROUGH EDUCATION#

Educational policy in the United States 
has as an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural 
opportunity. 
In so far as this goal is achieved, the society becomes more 
fluid, artificial barriers to social mobility are reduced, and people 
at the lower end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the 
material 
and cultural goods of society. On the other hand, there is a counterbalancing 
purpose in education which is to pass on the advantages 
of the parents to their children. This leads to efforts at exclusiveness 
through private schools and to the maintenance of social stratification 
in the schools. Both of these purposes exist side by side without much 
overt conflict under present conditions. 

#MAXIMIZING ECONOMIC AND 
CULTURAL OPPORTUNITY#

The broad expansion of free education results 
both in raising the average economic and cultural level of the society 
and in promoting fluidity within the social structure. Fifty years 
ago the general raising of the school-leaving age to sixteen was an 
example of this movement. During the past decade the program has been 
carried on through expansion of free higher education in state universities, 
state colleges, and community colleges. The reaffirmation of 
American faith in the comprehensive high school, as expressed in the 
Conant study, is another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of 
maximizing opportunity through the equalizing of educational opportunity.

The recent federal government's student-loan program is 
another step in the direction of making higher education more available 
to lower-status youth. It is probably more effective than the expanded 
scholarship programs of the past decade, because the scholarship programs 
mainly aided the students with the best academic records (who 
were usually middle-class), and these students tended to use the scholarship 
funds to go to more expensive colleges. Meanwhile, the private 
colleges have increased their tuition rates so much that they have raised 
an economic barrier which dwarfs their scholarship funds. The gains 
in educational opportunity during the past decade have taken place 
largely in the publicly supported institutions.

Unfortunately, however, and for reasons to be discussed in the 
following chapter, no rate relationships can be made completely nondiscriminatory 
as long as all or some of the rates must be set above marginal 
costs in order to yield adequate revenues. And this fact may explain 
some of the disagreements among the experts as to the more rational 
formulas for the apportionment of total costs among different units 
of service. One such disagreement, which will receive attention in 
this next chapter, concerns the question whether rates for different kinds 
of service, in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination, must 
be made directly <proportional> to marginal costs, or whether they 
should be based instead on <differences> in marginal costs. Here, 
the choice is that between the horns of a dilemma. 

#TWO MAJOR TYPES 
OF FULLY DISTRIBUTED COST ANALYSIS#

_1. THE DOUBLE-STEP TYPE_ 
Despite 
an ambiguity due to its failure clearly to define "relative costs", 
the above exposition of fully distributed costing goes about as 
far as one can go toward expressing the basic philosophy of the practice. 
For more explicit expositions, one must distinguish different types 
of analyses. By all means the most important distinction is that 
between those total-cost apportionments which superimpose a distribution 
of admittedly unallocable cost residues on estimates of incremental 
or marginal costs, and those other apportionments which recognize no 
difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution.

The first, or double-step, type might also be called the "railroad 
type" because of its application to railroads (and other 
transportation agencies) by the Cost Section of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission. The Cost Section distinguishes between (directly) 
variable costs and constant costs in a manner noted in the preceding 
chapter. The variable costs alone are assigned to the different units 
of freight traffic as representing "long-run out-of-pocket costs"- 
a term with a meaning here not distinctly different from that of 
the economist's "long-run marginal costs". There remains a residue 
of total costs, or total "revenue requirements" which, since 
it is found to behave as if it were constant over substantial variations 
in traffic density, is strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis. 
Nevertheless, because the Cost Section has felt impelled to make 
some kind of a distribution of total costs, it has apportioned this residue, 
which it sometimes calls "burden", among the units of carload 
traffic on a basis (partly ton, partly ton-mile) which is concededly 
quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination. In recent 
years, this burden (which includes allowances for revenue deficiencies 
in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic!) 
has amounted to about one third of those total revenue requirements 
which the carload freight business is supposed to be called upon to 
meet.   Since this book is concerned only incidentally with railroad 
rates, it will not attempt to analyze the methods by which the staff 
of the Interstate Commerce Commission has estimated out-of-pocket 
costs and apportioned residue costs. Suffice it to say that the usefulness 
of the latter apportionment is questionable. But in any event, 
full credit should be given to the Cost Section for its express and 
overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignored in utility-cost 
analyses: namely, that between a cost allocation designed to 
reflect the actual behavior of costs in response to changes in rates 
of output of different classes of utility service; and a mere cost apportionment 
which somehow spreads among the classes and units of service 
even those costs that are strictly unallocable from the standpoint 
of specific cost determination. _2. THE SINGLE-STEP TYPE_ We turn 
now to a type of fully distributed cost analysis which, unlike the "railroad 
type", draws no distinction between cost allocation and cost 
apportionment: the single-step type. It might be called the "public 
utility" type because of the considerable use to which it has 
been put in gas and electric utility rate cases. Here no attempt is 
made, first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal costs and then to superimpose 
on these costs "reasonably distributed" residues of total 
costs. Instead, all of the total costs are treated as variable costs, 
although these costs are divided into costs that are deemed to be 
functions of different variables. Moreover, whereas in Interstate Commerce 
Commission parlance "variable cost" means a cost deemed to 
vary in <direct> proportion to changes in rate of output, in the type 
of analysis now under review "variable cost" has been used more 
broadly, so as to cover costs which, while a function of some one variable 
(such as output of energy, or number of customers), are not necessarily 
a <linear> function.   As already noted in an earlier 
paragraph, the more familiar cost analyses of utility enterprises or 
utility systems divide the total costs among a number of major classes 
of service, such as residential, commercial, industrial power, street 
lighting, etc&. This "grand division" permits many costs to be 
assigned in their entirety to some one class, such as street lighting, 
or at least to be excluded completely from some important class or classes. 
High-tension industrial power service, for example, would not 
be charged with any share of the maintenance costs or capital costs of 
the low-tension distribution lines. But the major portions of the total 
costs of a utility business are common or joint to all, or nearly 
all, classes of customers; and these costs must somehow be apportioned 
among the various classes and then must somehow be reapportioned among 
the units of service in order to report unit costs than can serve 
as tentative measures of reasonable rates.   The general basis on 
which these common costs are assigned to differently measured units 
of service will be illustrated by the following highly simplified problem 
of an electric-utility cost analysis. But before turning to this 
example, we must distinguish two subtypes of analysis, both of which belong 
to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type.

In the first subtype, the analyst (following the practice of railroad 
analysis in this particular respect) distributes both total operating 
costs and total annual capital costs (including an allowance for 
"cost of capital" or "fair rate of return") among the different 
classes and units of service. Here, an apportionment, say, of $5,000,000 
of the total costs to residential service as a class would include 
an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent as the cost of whatever capital 
is deemed to have been devoted to the service of the residential consumers.

But in the second subtype, which I take to be the one 
more frequently applied, only the operating expenses and not the "cost 
of capital" or "fair return" are apportioned directly among the 
various classes of service. To be sure, the capital investments in 
(or, alternatively, the estimated "fair values" of) the plant and 
equipment are apportioned among the different classes, as are also the 
gross revenues received from the sales of the different services. But 
any resulting excess of revenues received from a given class of service 
over the operating costs imputed to this class is reported as a "return" 
realized on the capital investment attributed to the same 
service. Thus, during any given year (a) if the revenues from the residential 
service are $7,000,000, (b) if the operating expenses imputed 
to this class of service come to $5,000,000, and (c) if the net investment 
in (or value of) the plant and equipment deemed devoted to this 
service amounts to $30,000,000, the cost analyst will report that residential 
service, in the aggregate, has yielded a return of $2,000,000 
or 6-2/3 per cent. Other services will show different rates of return, 
some probably much lower and some higher.   There are obvious 
reasons of convenience for this practice of excluding "cost of capital" 
from the direct apportionment of annual costs among the different 
classes of service- notably, the avoidance of the controversial question 
what rate of return should be held to constitute "cost of capital" 
or "fair rate of return". But the practice is likely to be 
misleading, since it may seem to support a conclusion that, as long 
as the revenues from any class of service cover the imputed operating 
expenses plus <some> return on capital investment, however low, the 
rates of charge for this service are compensatory. Needless to say, any 
such inference would be quite unwarranted.   For the reason just 
suggested, I shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distributed 
cost apportionment in the following simplified example. That 
is to say, an allowance for "cost of capital" will be assumed to 
be included directly in the cost apportionment. 

#THREE-PART ANALYSIS 
OF THE COSTS OF AN ELECTRIC UTILITY BUSINESS#

In order to simplify 
the exposition of a typical fully apportioned cost analysis, let us 
assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company
