During the years of publication, supplement and replacement 
sheets were issued periodically. Coverage of the literature extends 
through 1954 and includes some 1955 references. It is to be hoped 
that some way will be found to keep this important work current. _FORMAT:_ 
The publication form is that of loose-leaf sheets (**f) 
contained in binders. The book is divided into chapters and in each chapter 
the material is grouped into Text, Tables, Illustrations, and 
Bibliography. Each group is paginated separately; numbers sometimes 
followed by letters are used so that insertions can be made. Inorganic 
structures are found in Chapters /2,-/12,, organic structures 
in Chapters /13,-/15,. Within each chapter an effort has been 
made to group together those crystals with similar structures. There 
are three indexes, i&e&, an inorganic formula index, a mineralogical 
name index, and a name index to organic compounds. _PUBLICATION 
AND DISTRIBUTION:_ Publisher of CRYSTAL STRUCTURES is Interscience 
Publishers, 250 Fifth Avenue, New York 1, N& Y&. The 
work consists of four sections and 5 supplements. Price of the complete 
work including all necessary binders is $148.50. #/2,-4. DANA'S 
SYSTEM OF MINERALOGY#

_ORGANIZATION:_ Six editions of 
James Dwight Dana's SYSTEM appeared between 1837 and 1892. 
In 1915 Edward S& Dana, editor of the sixth edition, asked W& 
E& Ford of Yale University to prepare a seventh edition of his 
father's work. A number of people became involved in the preparation 
but work was slow until 1937. In that year a grant was obtained from 
the Penrose Fund of the Geological Society of America to finance 
additional full-time workers. Money was also advanced by the publishers, 
John Wiley + Sons, Inc&. Volume /1, was completed in 1941 
and published in 1944. The editors of this volume and Volume /2, 
were the late Charles Palache, Clifford Frondel, and the late Harry 
Berman, all of Harvard University. Work on Volume /2, was 
begun in 1941, interrupted by the war in 1942, and resumed in 1945. The 
volume was completed in 1950 and published in 1951. A supplementary 
grant from the Geological Society of America helped finance its 
publication. Besides the editors there were many contributors in the 
United States and Great Britain to Volumes /1, and /2,. W& 
E& Ford, for example, continued to supply data on the occurrence 
of minerals until his death in 1939. Volume /3, is nearing completion 
and there are plans to revise Volume /1,. The project is currently 
supported by Harvard University. _SUBSTANCES:_ Minerals. 
_PROPERTIES:_ Crystallographic, physical, optical, and chemical 
properties. The crystallographic data given include interaxial angles 
and unit cell dimensions; the physical property values include hardness, 
melting point, and specific gravity. _SOURCES OF DATA:_ Almost 
entirely original articles in journals; abstracts and other compilations 
on rare occasions when original papers are not available. 
_CRITICALITY:_ All information is carefully appraised and uncertain 
facts are designated by (?). An authentic diffraction pattern 
is always obtained and optical properties are frequently checked. _USE 
OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ Recommendations 
of international authorities, such as the International Union 
of Crystallography, are followed. There is a complete synonymy at 
the beginning of each species description. _CURRENCY:_ Currency 
in the usual sense cannot be maintained in an undertaking of this sort. 
_FORMAT:_ The data are presented in text and tables in bound 
volumes. Volume /1, of the seventh edition contains an introduction 
and data for eight classes of minerals; Volume /2, contains data 
for forty-two classes. References are given at the end of each mineral 
description and a general index is given at the end of each volume. 
There will be a comprehensive index in Volume /3, covering all 
three volumes. _PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION:_ Volume /1, (**f) 
of the seventh edition of DANA'S SYSTEM OF MINERALOGY was published 
in 1944 and Volume /2, (**f) in 1951 by John Wiley + Sons, 
Inc&, New York, N& Y&. (The association of Wiley + Sons 
with the Dana Mineralogies dates back to 1844 when they published 
the second edition of the SYSTEM.) The two volumes are available 
from the publisher for $14.00 and $16.00, respectively. #/2,-5. 
THE GROTH INSTITUTE#

_ORGANIZATION:_ "The Groth Institute", 
which was established in 1958, is a group activity affiliated 
with the Physics Department of The Pennsylvania State University, 
University Park, Pa&. Ray Pepinsky is the Director. The Institute 
derives its name from Paul von Groth's CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE, 
a five-volume work which appeared between 1906 and 1919. 
The resident staff is large and consists of professional assistants, 
graduate students, abstractors, librarian, technical editor, machine 
operators, secretarial help, and others. There are also corresponding 
members and outside advisory groups. The Air Force Office of Scientific 
Research has provided financial assistance in the early stages 
of the Institute's program. _SUBSTANCES:_ All crystalline 
substances and other solid-state materials. _PROPERTIES:_ The 
aim is to collect a very broad range of physical, chemical, morphological, 
and structural data for crystals on an encyclopedic scale and to 
seek all possible useful and revealing correlations of properties with 
internal structure. _SOURCES OF DATA:_ The first stage of operation 
has centered on the literature imaging of critical or summarizing 
tabulations such as the Barker Index. Coverage of primary literature 
will follow. Unpublished data will be available to the Groth institute 
from cooperating groups and individuals. _CRITICALITY:_ 
Critical evaluation of all data compiled is not a primary aim of this 
project. However, the proposed correlation of the many interrelated 
properties of crystals will reveal discrepancies in the recorded data 
and suggest areas for reinvestigation. In addition, the availability 
of computers will permit recalculation and refinement of much structural 
information. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL 
CONSTANTS:_ For punched-card or tape storage of information all 
literature values must be conformed to a common language. In this 
way a degree of unification of nomenclature, symbols, and units will be 
realized. 
BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL CLASSES OF foods differ in their requirements 
for preservation, a number of methods have been developed over the years 
involving one or a combination of procedures such as dehydration, 
fermentation, salting, chemical treatment, canning, refrigeration, and 
freezing. The basic objectives in each instance are to make available 
supplies of food during the intervals between harvesting or slaughter, 
to minimize losses resulting from the action of microorganisms and 
insects, and to make it possible to transport foods from the area of 
harvest or production to areas of consumption.   In earlier years, 
the preservation of food was essentially related to survival. In 
the more sophisticated atmosphere of today's developed nations, food-preservation 
techniques have sought also to bring variety, peak freshness, 
and optimum taste and flavor in foods at reasonable cost to the 
comsumer.   With the development of nuclear technology, isotopic 
materials, and machine radiation sources in recent years, the possibilities 
of applying ionizing radiation to the preservation of foods attracted 
the attention of investigators in the United States and throughout 
the world. An early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate 
answer to practically all food preservation problems was soon dispelled. 
Interest remained, however, in the possibility that it would serve 
as a useful supplementary method for counteracting spoilage losses 
and for preserving some foods at lower over-all costs than freezing, or 
without employing heat or chemicals with their attendant taste alterations. 

#FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPOILAGE OF FOODS#

The chief 
factors responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuffs are (1) microorganisms 
such as bacteria, molds, and yeasts, (2) enzymes, (3) insects, 
(4) sprouting, and (5) chemical reactions. Microorganisms are often 
responsible for the rapid spoilage of foods. Of special concern is 
the growth of bacteria such as <Clostridium botulinum> which generate 
poisonous products. Enzymatic action in stored food produces changes 
which can adversely affect the appearance of food or its palatability. 
Spoilage by chemical action results from the reaction of one group 
of components in the food with others or with its environment, as in 
corrosion of the walls of metal containers or the reaction of fats with 
oxygen in the air to produce rancidity.   Sprouting is a naturally 
occurring phenomenon in stored potatoes, onions, carrots, beets, 
and similar root vegetables. Insect infestation is a problem of importance 
chiefly in stored grain. The presence of parasitic organisms 
such as <Trichinella spiralis> in pork introduces another factor which 
must be dealt with in food processing.   To permit the storage 
of food for long periods of time, a method of preservation must accomplish 
the destruction of microorganisms and inhibition of enzymatic 
action. The term "sterilization" applies to methods involving essentially 
complete destruction of all microorganisms. Food treated in 
this manner and protected from recontamination by aseptic methods of packaging 
and containment presumably could be stored for long periods without 
refrigeration. The process of "pasteurization" involves milder 
and less prolonged heat treatment which accomplishes the destruction 
of most, but not all, of the microorganisms. Less severe thermal 
treatment as by blanching or scalding serves to inactivate enzymes. 

#GENERAL 
EFFECTS OF IONIZING RADIATION#

Ionizing radiation can cause 
the destruction of microorganisms and insects involved in food spoilage 
or, at lower doses, can inhibit their action. It furnishes a means 
of destroying insects in stored grain products as well as certain parasitic 
organisms present in meats. Deactivation of enzymes is also 
possible, although some types require extremely heavy doses of 10 ~Mrad 
or more. Because of undesirable flavors, odors, colors, and generally 
low palatability associated with radiation treatment of this magnitude, 
the inactivation of enzymes is best accomplished prior to irradiation 
by the conventional heat-processing methods of blanching.

Radiation does not retard the chemical spoilage of food. It will, 
however, inhibit the sprouting of potatoes and other root vegetables.

The radiation doses required for the preservation of foods 
are in the following ranges: _1._ For radiosterilization, to destroy 
all organisms for long-term preservation- about 4.5 ~Mrad for 
nonacid foods of low salt content. _2._ For radiopasteurization, 
to partially destroy microorganisms; results vary with types of food, 
storage conditions, and objectives of treatment- commonly of the 
order of 0.2 ~Mrads but up to about 0.8 ~Mrads. _3._ For 
destruction of insects- about 25,000 ~rads. _4._ For inhibiting 
the sprouting of root vegetables- 4,000 to 10,000 ~rads. 
Preserving foods with ionizing radiation leads to some undesirable side 
effects, particularly at the higher radiation dosages. In this respect, 
the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized 
foods has, to date, been found to be low in comparison with 
fresh and commercially processed foods. A number of foods are quite 
acceptable as regards taste and palatability, however, at dosages substantially 
less than sterilization levels. Moreover, the nutritive value 
of irradiated foods apparently undergoes little, if any, change, although 
some of the fat-soluble vitamins are affected by sterilization 
doses. 

#RADIATION SOURCES#

For irradiation of food, the results 
obtained depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation, 
and X-ray, gamma, and high-energy electron radiation are suitable. 
Aside from availability and economic considerations, each has certain 
practical advantages; for example, gamma rays give deeper penetration 
but cannot be focused or collimated, whereas unidirectional electron
