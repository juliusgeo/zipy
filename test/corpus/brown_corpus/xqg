the South last year, but Tim and his wife settled here. Never had 
no trouble with him before, thought he was a hard worker, hustling around 
to get a full week's work. Anyway, Julia asks me to **h".

"Julia"?   "Come on, <Inspector>, look alive. 
Julia Buck, the deceased", Moore said, slipping me his smug, idiot-grin 
again. "Julia asks me to come out at once. But she didn't 
sound real alarmed **h you know, like there was any immediate danger. 
I got there at 9:47 A&M&, found her strangled. I would have 
come sooner if I'd known **h. No doubt about Tim being the killer- 
I have a witness. Don't know why the County had to send anybody 
up here. Told them I can handle this".   "Yeah, seems 
you have a nice package, with all the strings tied. Who's **h"?

"I'll collar Tim before night".   "Who's your 
witness"?   "Julia had- has- an old Indian woman cooking 
for her- Nellie Harris. Probably the last of the original Island 
Indians. Nellie was in the kitchen, had just come to work, when 
she heard Tim arguing with Julia in the living room. Swears she 
recognized his voice, that Tim yelled, 'It's my money and I want 
it'! and then rushed out of the house. Then she heard Julia phone 
me. Nellie went on with her house work- until I found Julia dead. 
And before you say it, Nellie ain't near strong enough to have 
strangled Julia. There's no doubt this Tim sneaked back and killed 
Mrs& Buck. Another fact: Tim's disappeared- on the run. 
But there's no way off the Point except through my road block. Guess 
you want to see the body- have her up the street in Doc Abel's 
office". "Let's see it".   We walked up Main Street 
to this big white house, then around to the back. Being the Harbors 
sole doctor, Abel was also its Medical Examiner. The corpse was 
on a table, covered by a sheet. Doc Abel was busy up front with some 
of his live patients. Pulling back the sheet, I examined the bruises 
around Julia Buck's once slender throat. Powerful hands had killed 
her. "Find any prints"?   Chief Moore shook his big 
head, seemed lost in thought as he stared at the nude body. Then he 
said, "Never noticed it before **h I mean, when she was dressed **h 
but for a woman her age, Julia had a real fine figure".   I 
dropped the sheet, glanced at my watch. It was almost one and I hadn't 
had lunch. Still, I wanted to get this over with, had a lot of 
paper work waiting in my own office. I told him, "I want to go see 
the Buck house".   "Sure".   Walking back down Main 
Street, I said, "I saw the Harbor's one squad car at the 
road block, we'll ride out in my car".   "Naw, we'll use 
mine", Moore said, opening the door of a sleek white Jaguar roadster. 
As I slid in beside him he said, "Some heap, hey? Got a heck 
of a buy on this, dirt cheap".   "Yeah, it's a real load", 
I told him, looking up the street at my battered Ford. 
Five racing minutes later we pulled into the driveway of this typical 
two-story house, and when the Jaguar stopped I managed to swallow. 
There was a garage and a modern barn in the rear, all of it standing 
between two large flat fields planted in early potatoes. Everything 
shouted gentleman farming, the kind of grandfather-father-to son folding 
money the Point is known for. The fins of a Caddy were sticking 
out of the garage, while the inside of the house was a comfortable mixture 
of old and expensive contemporary furniture.   Nellie Harris 
wasn't old, she was ancient- a tiny shriveled woman with a face 
like a tan prune. She was also stone deaf in her right ear. She calmly 
repeated what Moore had told me. When I asked, "Why didn't 
you go into the living room to see how Mrs& Buck was"? the old 
gal stared at me with her hard eyes, said, "She didn't call. I 
do the living room last. I went up stairs and did the bath and her 
bedroom- way I always do in the morning".   "Have you any 
idea what this Tim and Mrs& Buck were arguing about"? 
"Probably wages. Miss Julia was a hard woman with a dollar. Years 
ago when I asked her to put me in Social Security, so's I wouldn't 
have to be working now, Miss Julia threatened to fire me- 
all because it would mean a few more dollars a year to her". 
"Did you hear Tim return"?   "No sir. Nobody came until 
Chief Moore".   I drummed on the kitchen table with my pencil. 
"Mrs& Buck have any men friends"?   "Her"? 
The wrinkled mouth laughed, revealing astonishingly strong, white, teeth. 
"I never see none. But then I wasn't her social secretary".

"Was she on friendly terms with other members of her family"?

"Didn't have no family- around here. They had 
a son- killed in the war".   I walked into the living 
room. There didn't seem to be any signs of a struggle. I told Moore, 
"Where does Tim's wife live"?   "I'll take you 
there. Look Jed, this is an open and shut case and I have to relieve 
my men at the road block soon. Okay, come on".   We did 80 
miles an hour across a hard dirt road to a cluster of shacks. In late 
summer migratory workers lived five and six to a room in these. Now 
they were empty, except for a cottage across the road.   Mrs& 
Tim Williams was about 21, with skin the color of bitter chocolate, 
and if you discounted the plain dress and worn slippers, she was startlingly 
pretty. The inside of their place was full of new furniture, five 
bucks down and a buck a week stuff, but all of it clean and full of 
the warmth of a home.   Mrs& Williams was both sullen and frightened. 
She said she didn't know a thing- Tim had left the house 
at six in the morning, as usual. She hadn't seen him since.

"Did Mrs& Buck owe him any wages"? I asked.   "Well, 
for this week, but they wasn't due 'till Saturday. Listen, 
Mr& Inspector, no matter what anybody say, my Tim didn't kill 
that woman! 
Tim is a good man, hard working. He strong as a bull but 
gentle as a baby. Even if he angry, Tim wouldn't hurt a woman. He 
never in his life took a hand to a woman or **h"   "We'll 
get him soon, see what he says", Chief Moore cut in.   "Does 
your husband have a car"? I asked.   "Got us an old 
station wagon. Need it for the job".   I asked a silly question: 
"You've no idea where your husband could be, now"?

She shook her head. I knew she was lying. I stood there, staring 
at her for a moment- thinking mostly of her beauty and her poverty.

Moore said, "Come on, Jed, I have to get to my men".

On my way out I told her, "If you should **h eh **h just 
happen to see your husband, get him to give himself up. He'll get a 
fair trial. Hiding out like this won't get him anything, except more 
trouble, or a bullet".   "Yes. I'll tell him- <if> 
I see him".   We made it back to the Harbor in less than four 
minutes. I tried not to act scared. That Jaguar could really barrel 
along. I told Moore I was going to eat, get some forms filled out 
by Doc Abel.   Chief Moore said, "If I don't see you 
when I return, see you for certain at my road block, Inspector".

I had a bowl of decent chowder, phoned the Doc and he said he'd 
leave the death statements with his girl- in a half hour. Lighting 
my pipe, I took a walk. The Harbor is a big yachting basin in 
the summer. Even now, there were several slick cruisers tied to the dock, 
an ocean-going yawl anchored inside the breakwater. There was a 
34 foot Wheeler with CHIEF BOB'S in big gold letters on its stern 
also tied up at the dock. It wasn't a new boat, about five years 
old, but fitted with fishing outriggers and chairs. I asked an old 
guy running a fishing station if the boat was Moore's. He said, "You 
bet. Bob Moore is plumb crazy about blue fishing".   I 
dropped into the doctor's office, picked up my forms. As I was walking 
back to the Police Station, which was in the same building with 
the City Hall and Post Office, I saw Mrs& Tim Williams sneaking 
into the back of my car. If she moved gracefully, she was clumsy 
at it.   I got into the front seat. She was 'hiding' on 
the floor of the back seat, the soft curves of her back and hips- rousing 
lines. I drove out of the Harbor, turned off into a dirt road 
among the scrub pine trees and stopped. I waited a few minutes and she 
sat up. For another moment we didn't talk, then she began to weep. 
She mumbled, "I just know that Chief Moore is out to kill my Tim"!

"Maybe. I never saw him so anxious before", I 
said, lighting my pipe and offering her a cigarette. "Of course, it 
could be because this is his first murder case. You know where Tim 
is, don't you, Mrs& Williams"?   She puffed on the cigarette 
slowly, sitting slumped against the back seat; didn't answer. 
But the police have dropped the case. I want you to go to Pearson City 
and find out why- first-hand stuff for your modern crime series. 
Take the same train Diana Beauclerk took and get there at the same 
time. Go to the same hotel and occupy the same suite- 1105".

"Will the hotel rent it so soon after the crime"?   "Why 
not? The police have finished with it. Besides, the number 
of the suite hasn't been published in any newspaper. To the hotel people, 
you'll just be an innocent tourist who happens to ask for that 
particular suite".   "Still, they may not want to rent it".

"That's your headache. Once inside, keep your eyes open"!

"For what"! Alec was growing more and more skeptical. 
"The police will have gone over every square inch of the place 
with a fine-tooth comb. The hotel people will have scoured and vacuumed 
it. Ten to one, it's even been redecorated"!   "There's 
always a chance they may have overlooked something", returned 
the chief. "I'm betting on that chance. Interview the bellboy 
and chambermaid who waited on Beauclerk. Study the topography of the 
suite. Soak up local color. Reenact everything Beauclerk did.

Try to imagine you're going to be murdered yourself- between 
eleven p&m& and one a&m& the night you arrive".   Alec 
smirked. "Cheerful way to spend an evening"! A sudden thought 
wiped the smirk from his face. "Suppose the murderer should return 
to the scene of the crime"!   The chief's eyes gleamed. 
He spoke softly. "That is exactly what I'm hoping for. After all, 
the murderer is still at large. And the key to the suite is still 
missing". ##

On the train Alec refreshed his memory of the Beauclerk 
case by reading teletype flimsies- spot-news stories about 
the crime sent out by the <Pearson City Star,> a member of the Syndicate 
Press.   Diana Beauclerk was a second-rate actress living 
in New York. Two weeks ago she had gone west to Pearson City. 
Daniel Forbes, her divorced husband, lived there. So did the firm 
of lawyers who had got her the divorce, Kimball and Stacy. 
She reached Pearson City at nine p&m& and went straight to the 
Hotel Westmore. She telephoned the junior partner of her law firm, 
Martin Stacy, and asked him to call at her hotel that evening.

At the time of her divorce Forbes had promised to pay her a lump sum 
in lieu of further alimony if she remarried. According to Stacy, 
she told him she was planning to remarry and she wanted him to ask Forbes 
for the lump sum. Stacy replied that it would bankrupt Forbes, 
who had just sunk all his money in a real estate venture.   Stacy 
said he left her suite at nine forty-five p&m&. She was in good 
health and spirits, but still determined to get the money from Forbes. 
No one saw Stacy leave. No other visitor inquired for her that 
evening.   Next morning she was found dead in her suite with a bullet 
from a .22-caliber Colt revolver in her brain. According to the 
medical examiner, she was shot between eleven p&m& and one a&m&. 
Her door was locked and the key was missing. So was the gun.
