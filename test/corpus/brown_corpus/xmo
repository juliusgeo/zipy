for these subjects to be less guarded and to relax, since any reaction 
seemed acceptable to the examiner as "normal".   The 
nai^ve state, Condition /1,, could therefore be viewed as an inhibiting 
one for 24% of the subjects in this study. They were not free 
to be themselves in this situation, an interpersonal one, where there 
was an observer of their reactions and they had no guide for acceptable 
behavior. Instructions to relax, i&e&, to be "spontaneous", 
and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have, was not sufficiently 
reassuring until some idea of the possibilities of normal reactions 
had been given. While other conditions might be even more effective 
in bringing about a change from immobility to mobility in Kohnstamm 
reactivity, it is our hypothesis that all such conditions would 
have as a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject 
which enabled him to divorce himself temporarily from feelings of 
responsibility for his behavior.   Alcohol ingestion succeeded in 
changing immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject 
(the only one with whom this technique was tried). This subject, who 
has been undergoing psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five years, did 
not give a positive Kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardized 
conditions used in this experiment while sober. After two drinks 
containing alcohol, her arm flew upward very freely. There was evident 
delight on the part of the subject in response to her experience of 
the freedom of movement. She described herself as having the same kind 
of "irresponsible" feeling as she had once experienced under hypnosis. 
She ascribed her delight with both experiences to the effect 
they seemed to have of temporarily removing from her the controls which 
she felt so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might 
seem appropriate to relax these controls.   Many subjects attributed 
differences 
in Kohnstamm reactivity to differences in degrees of subjective 
control- voluntary as the Kohnstamm-positive subjects perceived 
it and involuntary as the Kohnstamm-negative subjects perceived it. 
These suggested interpretations were given by the subjects spontaneously 
when they were told that there were people who reacted differently 
than they had. The Kohnstamm-positive subjects described the vivid 
experience of having their arms rise as one in which they exercised no 
control. They explained its absence in others on the basis of an intervention 
of control factors. They felt that they too could counteract 
the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they had once experienced 
the reaction. Some of those who did not initially react with 
an arm-elevation also associated their behavior in the situation with 
control factors- an inability to relinquish control voluntarily. 
One subject spontaneously asked (after her arm had finally risen), "Do 
you suppose I was unconsciously keeping it down before"? Another 
said that her arm did not go up at first "because I wouldn't 
let it; I thought it wasn't supposed to". This subject was 
one 
who gave an arm-elevation on the second trial in the nai^ve state but 
not in the first. She had felt that her arm wanted to go up in the 
first trial, but had consciously prevented it from so doing. She 
explained nonreactivity of others by saying that they were "not letting 
themselves relax". When informed that there were some persons who 
did not have their arm go up, she commented, "I don't see how 
they can prevent it". In contrast to this voluntary-control explanation 
for nonreactivity given by the Kohnstamm-positive subjects, the 
Kohnstamm-negative 
subjects offered an involuntary-control hypothesis 
to explain nonreactivity. They felt that they were relaxing as much as 
they could and that any control factors which might be present to prevent 
response must be on an unconscious level.   The above discussion 
does not mean to imply that control factors were completely in 
abeyance in the Kohnstamm-positive subjects; but rather that they could 
be diminished sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation. 
One Kohnstamm-positive subject who had both arms rise while being tested 
in the nai^ve condition described her subjective experience as 
follows: "You feel they're going up and you're on a stage and 
it's not right for them to do so and then you think maybe that's 
what's supposed to happen". She then described her experience as 
one in which she first had difficulty accepting for herself a state of 
being in which she relinquished control. However, she was able to relax 
and yield to the moment.   It is our hypothesis that Kohnstamm-positive 
subjects are less hesitant about relinquishing control than are 
Kohnstamm-negative subjects; that they can give up their control and 
allow themselves to be reactors rather than actors. It is our belief 
that this readiness to relinquish some control was evidenced by the 
Kohnstamm-positive 
subjects in some of the other experimental situations 
to be discussed below. Thus, this readiness to relax controls, evidenced 
in the Kohnstamm situation, appears to be a more general personality 
factor. _ANISEIKONIC ILLUSION_ The Kohnstamm-positive subjects 
seemed to be freer to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible 
in the external world. There was a significantly greater number 
in this group who reported a desk as being in a tilted position while 
a tennis ball resting on it remained stationary on the incline. This 
occurred in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be going 
downhill. They knew that their perceptual experience differed from 
objective reality since they had seen the desk and ball prior to putting 
on the aniseikonic lenses. Yet they were not so bound by past experience 
and constriction as to deny their immediate perceptions and to 
be dominated by their knowledge of what the experience should be. The 
change in perceptions by some of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects, 
after they had been informed of the possibilities of normal reactions, 
suggests that their constriction and guardedness is associated with 
their general mode of responding to strange or unknown situations. They 
were able to experience at first, in terms of past conventionality. 
When informed as to the various possibilities of normal reactions, they 
were then able to experience the uniqueness of the present. It might 
be postulated that these subjects are unduly afraid of being wrong; 
that they perceive new internal and environmental situations as "threatening" 
until they are tested and proved otherwise.   While 
the interpretations that have been given are inferences only, they 
gain support from such comments as the following, which was made by one 
of the Kohnstamm-negative subjects who did not, on the first trial, 
perceive the tilt illusion. 
_CONTROL OF SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS_ It would have been desirable for 
the two communities to have differed only in respect to the variable 
being investigated: the degree of structure in teaching method. The 
structured schools were in an industrial city, with three-family tenement 
houses typical of the residential areas, but with one rather sizable 
section of middle-class homes. The unstructured schools were in 
a large suburban community, predominantly middle- to upper-middle class, 
but fringed by an industrial area. In order to equate the samples 
on socioeconomic status, we chose schools in both cities on the basis 
of socioeconomic status of the neighborhoods. School principals and guidance 
workers made ratings of the various neighborhoods and the research 
team made independent observations of houses and dwelling areas. 
An objective scale was developed for rating school neighborhoods from 
these data. Equal proportions of children in each city were drawn from 
upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods. _SUBJECTS_ Individual 
differences in maturation and the development of readiness for 
learning to read indicate that not until the third grade have most 
children had ample opportunity to demonstrate their capacity for school 
achievement. Therefore, third-grade children were chosen as subjects 
for this study.   For purposes of sample selection only (individual 
tests were given later) we obtained group test scores of reading 
achievement and intelligence from school records of the entire third-grade 
population in each school system. The subjects for this study were 
randomly selected from stratified areas of the distribution, one-third 
as underachievers, one-third medium, and one-third over-achievers. 
Children whose reading scores were at least one standard deviation 
below the regression line of each total third-grade school population 
were considered under-achievers for the purposes of sample selection. 
Over-achievers were at least one standard deviation above the regression 
line in their school system. The final sample was not significantly 
different from a normal distribution in regard to reading achievement 
or intelligence test scores. Twenty-four classrooms in twelve unstructured 
schools furnished 156 cases, 87 boys and 69 girls. Eight classrooms 
in three structured schools furnished 72 cases, 36 boys and 36 
girls. Administrative restrictions necessitated the smaller sample size 
in the structured schools.   It was assumed that the sampling 
procedure was purely random with respect to the personality variables 
under investigation. _RATING SCALE OF COMPULSIVITY_ An interview 
schedule of open-ended questions and a multiple-choice questionnaire 
were prepared, and one parent of each of the sample children was seen 
in the home. The parent was asked to describe the child's typical 
behavior in certain standard situations in which there was an opportunity 
to observe tendencies toward perfectionism in demands upon self 
and others, irrational conformity to rules, orderliness, punctuality, 
and need for certainty. The interviewers were instructed not to suggest 
answers and, as much as possible, to record the parents' actual 
words as they described the child's behavior in home situations.

The rating scale of compulsivity was constructed by first perusing 
the interview records, categorizing all evidence related to compulsivity, 
then arranging a distribution of such information apart from the 
case records. Final ratings were made on the basis of a point system 
which was developed after studying the distributions of actual behaviors 
recorded and assigning weight values to each type of behavior that 
was deviant from the discovered norms. Children scoring high in compulsivity 
were those who gave evidence of tension or emotionality in situations 
where there was lack of organization or conformity to standards 
and expectations, or who made exaggerated efforts to achieve these goals. 
The low compulsive child was one who appeared relatively unconcerned 
about such matters. For instance, the following statement was rated 
low in compulsivity, "She's naturally quite neat about things, 
but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy. But she 
cleans it up very well when I remind her". _MEASUREMENT OF ANXIETY_ 
Castaneda, <et al>& revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for 
use with children. The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota 
Multiphastic Personality Inventory, with item selection based upon 
clinical definitions of anxiety. There is much research evidence to 
validate the use of the instrument in differentiating individuals who 
are likely to manifest anxiety in varying degrees. Reliability and validation 
work with the Children's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda, <et 
al>& demonstrated results closely similar to the findings with 
the adult scale. Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group 
testing device, in this study it was individually administered by psychologically 
trained workers who established rapport and assisted the children 
in reading the items. _RELATIONSHIP OF ANXIETY TO COMPULSIVITY_ 
The question may be raised whether or not we are dealing with 
a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity. The two ratings yield a 
correlation of +.04, which is not significantly different from zero; 
therefore, we have measured two different characteristics. In theory, 
compulsive behavior is a way of diminishing anxiety, and one might expect 
a negative association except for the possibility that for many 
children the obsessive-compulsive defenses are not sufficient to quell 
the amount of anxiety they suffer. The issue of interaction between 
anxiety and compulsivity will be taken up later. _CRITERION MEASUREMENT_ 
In the primary grades, reading permeates almost every aspect of 
school progress, and the children's early experiences of success or 
failure in learning to read often set a pattern of total achievement 
that is relatively enduring throughout the following years. In establishing 
criterion measurements, it was therefore thought best to broaden 
the scope beyond the reading act itself. The predicted interaction 
effect should, if potent, extend its influence over all academic achievement.

The Stanford Achievement Test, Form ~J, was administered 
by classroom teachers, consisting of a battery of six sub-tests: 
Paragraph Meaning, Word Meaning, Spelling, Language, Arithmetic 
Computation, and Arithmetic Reasoning. All of these sub-tests
