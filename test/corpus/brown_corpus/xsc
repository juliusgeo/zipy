there were certain things he could never know. Then he thought of those 
Old Testament figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Just 
figures out of a tribal folklore. Could he honestly believe it would 
be good for Carla to have those old prophets gripping her imagination 
now? Being a woman though, she would take only what she needed 
from church. It was too bad he wasn't a Catholic himself. Or a 
Protestant, or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists, or a strict orthodox 
Communist. What was the matter with him that they all wearied 
him? It was the times, he was sure. All the ideologies changing from 
day to day, right under his eyes, so how could a man look to any one 
of them for an enlargement of his freedom? It was all too wearying. 
Look somewhere else. But where? Just the same, he thought, pondering 
over it, it would be a good thing for a girl like Carla if she 
got up and went to church.   A half hour later he got her up to 
go out for breakfast so the Ferraros, hearing them hurrying down the 
stairs, would think they were going to a late mass. It seemed to him 
that if the Ferraros felt sure of them, could place them, it would 
help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla.   "Since we're 
having coffee with them this afternoon", he said, "I think 
I'll ask the daughter if we can pay her to come in every day to clean 
for us". And he waited for her to say, "Oh, no, I can do it, 
Sam. There's so little to do".   "Why not"? she said. 
"I'm not good at that kind of thing".   "This afternoon 
let's take an air with them. Let's be fine superior people of 
great dignity", he said as if he were joking.   "If <you> 
find it necessary, Sam, go ahead", she said, turning on the stair. 
"I am what I am. I can't help it". Her words remained with 
him, worrying him for hours. He didn't know how she would behave with 
other people.   When they walked into the Ferraro apartment, 
the old lady, bowing and smiling, said softly. <"Ciao,"> and 
put 
out her hand. Her little brown face wrinkled up, her brown eyes gleamed, 
and with her little gestures she said all the courteous things. Agnese, 
smiling too, said, "'Ello", and then more slowly, "I 
am happy". And they sat down and began their little coffee party. 
The Ferraros offered them biscuits with the coffee. Acting only as 
interpreter Carla, her hands folded on her lap, was utterly impersonal. 
She would turn to them, then turn to him, then turn again. Watching 
her, he felt like a spectator at a tennis game, with the ball being 
bounced back and forth. Signora Ferraro, bobbing her head encouragingly, 
asked Sam about Canada, having a special interest. Carla translated. 
The old woman had a nephew from North Italy, a poor boy from 
a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment, and who 
had migrated to Canada to work on the railway. For a year the boy 
had lived in the bush in a boxcar. Did many of Sam's countrymen live 
in boxcars in the bush? Had Sam ever lived in a boxcar? she 
wanted to know. Regretfully Sam explained that he had no experience 
with boxcars. Just the same, the old woman said, she would write to her 
nephew in his boxcar and tell him she had met a nice man from his adopted 
country. And Sam thanked her, and hoped he might meet her nephew 
back home, and asked her if she had any further news of the Pope.

A very great Pope, this one, the old woman explained, her black 
eyes sparkling. An intellectual. But very mystical too. It was 
said that he had had a vision. Just as thousands that day in Portugal 
had seen the sun dancing in the sky, he had seen the same thing later 
in his own garden, and she turned to Agnese for confirmation. Agnese 
had been sitting quietly, listening with the serenity of the unaware. 
Now a little flush came on her pale homely face and enchantment in 
her eyes. The Holy Father would die soon, she said to Carla, so she 
could translate for Sam, although he had a brilliant doctor, a man 
who did not need the assistance of those doctors offered by the great 
rulers of the world. Yes, the Pope could die and quickly be made a 
saint. No, he was indeed a saint now. Nodding approvingly and swelling 
with importance, the old lady whispered confidentially. There was 
a certain discontent among the cardinals. The Pope, in the splendor 
of his great intellect, had neglected them a little. There would be changes 
made, and Signor Raymond should understand that when the Pope 
died it was like the end of a regime in Rome. Jobs would be lost and 
new faces would become prominent.   Did Signor Raymond understand? 
Indeed he did, Sam said solemnly, trying to get Carla's 
eye. Surely she could see that these women were her Italians, too, 
he thought. Devout, orthodox and plain like a family she might meet in 
Brooklyn or Malta or Ireland. But Carla; eyes were on Agnese 
whose glowing face and softening eyes gave her a look of warmth and happiness. 
And Carla, watching in wonder, turned to Sam. "It means 
so much to her. It's like a flame, I guess", she said in a dreamy 
tone.

But one night Dookiyoon moved in the direction of the women's 
lodge, where Shades of Night had gone to purify herself.   With 
the blue flesh of night touching him he stood under a gentle hill 
caressing the flageolet with his lips, making it whisper. He saw her 
emerge suddenly, coming in her unhesitant fashion, her back stiff, her 
head erect, facing with contempt the night and whatever she would encounter, 
as if in her extreme disdain and indifference she would pass 
by all the outraged looks of those whom she might approach. In her dark, 
scornful fashion she proceeded to her destination, afraid of nothing, 
not even the evil spirits which kept her company in her time of bleeding.

Seeing her come, he caught his breath, feeling his heart 
bounce in him, and turned away, afraid now. Even he, wanting her, 
afraid of her and not knowing how to press his suit, feared the evil presences 
in her metabolism more. His breath caught, and, trembling, he 
closed his eyes and stumbled off. Going, he saw as often before some 
queer, hideous yellow face over his head, shining and weird like the 
old images 
which had invested him at other times like those that appear 
sometimes near the eyeballs when they are perhaps pressed by the thumbs.

He cried out to her, his back turned. Then he fled, not 
waiting to see if she minded him or took notice of his cry.   But 
she heard him go. Yet she did not hesitate and only turned slightly, 
her neck tall as she looked in his direction, and continued on her way 
toward the end of the camp.   Elsewhere others heard and stopped 
and waited, the women peering from their lodges then gathering in 
small, curious clusters. Early Spring came from her bed, from beside 
her half-drunk husband, Walitzee, and stood at the entrance way to 
her lodge hearing the mild commotion, the sound of hushed voices. Standing 
there she saw Shades of Night come through the trees and stop 
beside the lodge, silent, almost imperious, her body taut, simply standing 
without speaking or moving while the wife of Walitzee waited, perhaps 
denying the dread that moved in her. When at last she could suffer 
the insult no longer, nor face the girl's scorn, she said in a 
voice overloud:   "I shall call your father! Go back where 
you can bring no harm, or I will go and get the old man from his bed 
so he can see your shame"!   But the girl said only, "Tell 
him I am here, that I have come". And it was not Pile of Clouds 
she meant.   But now with real anger at last, something proud 
and indignant, Early Spring stood like a she wolf before her den 
and cried, "I will not shriek at you! I will tell you to go, not 
begging. Telling you"! And unsheathing the knife she used for 
curing hides she stepped away from the lodge, holding the knife at her 
side.   "You bring only wickedness", she said and it was not 
to a child any longer but to another woman who had come to skirt her 
lodge with the cunning hunger of a wild animal. Speaking in a low voice 
of loathing she went up to the girl, who stood with the same upright, 
scornful bearing and did not even look at the knife.   "Go 
take <helsq'iyokom,> your evil spirit, to the young boys", the 
woman said. "They do not have to face battle. I will not let your 
evil in. I will simply kill you first. Now go"!   The other 
women had come close now, their voices murmuring together until they 
stood buzzing in an angry knot, their threats mingling, rising, nagging 
at each other, each trying to make her indignation and anger felt. 
They picked up sticks and hurled them at the girl. The sticks fell 
like a shower around her and she felt them sting her flesh and send tiny 
points of pain along her thighs. They were all shouting at her as 
if she were the embodiment of the evil she brought. But she did not 
move, taking the words and the sticks in that old defiance of her extreme 
youth until suddenly Pile of Clouds came howling among them, swinging 
a great bullhide whip.   "Go back to your lodges"! he 
shouted. "A pack of dogs makes less noise"! He made the long 
whip sing and snap around their heads so that they ran screaming, some 
tripping over themselves in their flight. And Early Spring seized 
the whip and said:   "If you must flog someone, let it be her, 
your daughter. Drive the demons out of her and teach her to stay 
away from my husband"! But the old man turned on her, jerking the 
whip from her hand.   "Get into your hovel"! he spat. "Go 
back to that double-married man of yours who so parades his fine body 
among the young women. Keep him back, if you must tell me what to 
do. I will be the one to confront my daughter, not the wife of him who 
leads her to sin"!   She retreated before the naked shame 
in the old man and the fury beyond it and sank into the darkness of her 
lodge where Walitzee stirred, mumbling, sitting up in a half stupor 
to say:   "What worrisome thing happens? I thought I 
dreamed of wolves fighting". But she went to him and pressed herself 
against his nakedness, smelling the stale odor of the whisky he had 
stolen from TuHulHulZote.   She said, "There is nothing 
that concerns you here. Lie back and go to sleep. But do not dream. 
Do not let the wicked spirits enter your brain".   He sank back, 
sighing, and was soon asleep again.   Outside, the old man, 
beyond all the curses of the spirits his daughter bore, went to her and 
twisted the gnarled talons of his fingers in her hair and turned her 
and pushed her rudely ahead of him into the trees where the moon sent 
out a thousand arms. And, shoving her against a spruce, her back to 
him, he retreated with the whip and made it whine and crack in the damp 
air, shortening its arc until it narrowed to her flesh and the sound 
of it snarled and cracked, settling its own cruel demons on her shoulders 
while she stood as unchanged, as dark and motionless as ever, her 
eyes open and staring at the pale delineaments of the bark so close 
to her face.   She said to him, her father, "How was I begotten, 
in pain or joy? Is it for me to be forbidden the flesh you made 
grow on me? They all know your foolish name"!   She stared 
at the pale tracings on the tree, hearing her breath refracted from 
it, her face close and touching at time the rough edges of the bark. 
She felt the lash bite and heard her father say in crazed monosyllables 
words which had no meaning, like, "unnnt! **h sssshoo"! The 
sounds of an animal in rage and despair.   Suddenly the lash 
stopped fighting the air and she heard Pile of Clouds say in his high, 
quavering voice:   "Did you follow me to see my shame? 
Move from the line or I will settle the whip on you **h. Move! Do 
you hear the anger of the whip's whine"?   Turning, the 
girl saw Dookiyoon standing between, his narrow shoulders unbent, his 
arms hanging long and resigned. He said, "Let me take her blows, 
for there are demons in me too".   Then, without knowing why, 
she found herself running from them, fleeing wildly through the trees, 
dodging her own shadows until she came to a little hollow in the rocky 
ground with a big stone in the center behind which she knelt and hid, 
listening to the madness of her heart and wanting for once to cry.

For a while the young men waited outside the lodge of Tu 
Hul Hul Zote, glorying in his harsh language as he talked with himself. 
He shouted like a hoarse old mastiff, his hair stiff and bristling. 
He ranted and prophesied the doom of his enemies, walking in circles 
in and out of his living place, drinking stolen whisky in great, 
gasping draughts until finally, incoherent and sick, he fell into his 
own oblivion. He amused the young men who had been silent long enough. 
But they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution 
through his antics. Now they moved, rubbing their flesh alive again,
