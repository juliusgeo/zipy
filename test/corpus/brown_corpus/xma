and iodothyronines being correspondingly reduced. This appears 
to result from both a reduced amount of the iodine substrate and a more 
rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin. If the deficiency 
persists long enough, it is reasonable to suppose that the **f label 
will reflect the **f distribution in the thyroglobulin. Similar results 
might be expected from the influence of drugs or pathological conditions 
that limit iodide trapping, or organification, or accelerate thyroglobulin 
proteolysis. 

#B. THE THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE#

The 
name thyroid-stimulating hormone (~TSH) has been given to a substance 
found in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so 
far 
tested for its presence. The hormone has also been called thyrotrophin 
or thyrotrophic hormone. At the present time we do not know by what 
biochemical mechanism ~TSH acts on the thyroid, but for bio-assay 
of the hormone there are a number of properties by which its activity 
may be estimated, including release of iodine from the thyroid, increase 
in thyroid weight, increase in mean height of the follicular cells 
and increase in the thyroidal uptake of **f. Here we shall restrict 
discussion to those methods that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise 
for determining the concentration of ~TSH in blood. Brown 
(1959) has reviewed generally the various methods of assaying ~TSH, 
and the reader is referred to her paper for further information on 
the subject. 

#1. CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF PITUITARY 
~TSH#

As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce (1851) 
that there is a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid.. 
This connection was clarified by Smith and Smith (1922), who showed 
that saline extracts of fresh bovine pituitary glands could re-activate 
the atrophied thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpoles. The first attempts 
to isolate ~TSH came a decade later, when Janssen and Loeser 
(1931) used trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble ~TSH 
from insoluble impurities. After their work other investigators applied 
salt-fractionation techniques to the problem, as well as fractionation 
with organic solvents, such as acetone. Albert (1949) has concluded 
that the most active preparations of ~TSH made during this period, 
from 1931 to 1945, were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent 
as the starting material. Much of this work has been reviewed by 
White (1944) and by Albert (1949). Developments up to about 1957 have 
been discussed by Sonenberg (1958).   In the last few years, 
the application of chromatographic and other modern techniques to the 
problem of isolating ~TSH has led to further purification (Bates 
and Condliffe, 1960; Pierce, Carsten and Wynston, 1960). The most 
active preparations obtained by these two groups of investigators 
appear to be similar in potency, composition and physical properties.

Two problems present themselves in considering any hormone in 
blood. First, is the circulating form of the hormone the same as that 
found in the gland where it is synthesised and stored? Second, what 
is its concentration in normal circumstances and in what circumstances 
will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction? 
It is therefore necessary to consider the properties of pituitary 
~TSH if the fragmentary chemical information about blood 
~TSH is to be discussed rationally. The importance of knowing in 
what chemical forms the hormone may exist is accentuated by the recent 
observation that there exists an abnormally long-acting ~TSH in 
blood drawn from many thyrotoxic patients (Adams, 1958). Whether this 
abnormal ~TSH differs chemically from pituitary ~TSH, or 
is, alternatively, normal ~TSH with its period of effectiveness 
modified 
by some other blood constituent, cannot be decided without chemical 
study of the activity in the blood of these patients and a comparison 
of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary 
~TSH.   In evaluating data on the concentration of ~TSH 
in blood, one must examine critically the bio-assay methods used 
to obtain them. The introduction of the United States Pharmacopoeia 
reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equating of the 
~USP and international units of thyroid-stimulating activity have 
made it possible to compare results published by different investigators 
since that time. We should like to re-emphasise the importance of 
stating results solely in terms of international units of ~TSH activity 
and of avoiding the re-introduction of biological units. For 
the most part, this discussion will be confined to results obtained since 
the introduction of the reference standard. _A. STANDARD PREPARATIONS 
AND UNITS OF THYROID-STIMULATING ACTIVITY_ The international 
unit 
(u&), adopted to make possible the comparison of results from different 
laboratories (Mussett and Perry, 1955), has been defined as the 
amount of activity present in 13.5 ~mg of the International Standard 
Preparation. The international unit is equipotent with the ~USP 
unit adopted in 1952, which was defined as the amount of activity 
present in 20 ~mg of the ~USP reference substance. 

#INTRODUCTION#

Muscle weakness is now recognized as an uncommon though 
serious complication of steroid therapy, with most of the synthetic 
adrenal corticosteroids in clinical use. Although biopsies have 
shown structural changes in some of the reported cases of steroid-induced 
weakness, this case provides the only example known to us in which 
necropsy afforded the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle 
groups. The case described in this paper is that of an older man 
who developed disabling muscular weakness while receiving a variety of 
steroids for a refractory anemia. 

#REPORT OF CASE#

This patient 
was a 65-year-old white male accountant who entered the New York Hospital 
for his fourth and terminal admission on June 26, 1959, because 
of disabling weakness and general debility.   In 1953 the patient 
developed an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusions were 
given over a period of 4 years. Splenomegaly was first noted in 1956, 
and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time showed "scattered foci 
of fibrosis" suggestive of myelofibrosis. No additional transfusions 
were necessary after the institution of prednisone in July, 1957, 
in an initial dose of 40 mg& daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg& 
daily. This medication was continued until February, 1958.   In 
February, 1958, the patient suffered a myocardial infarction complicated 
by pulmonary edema. Additional findings at this time included 
cardiomegaly, peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans, and cholelithiasis. 
The hemoglobin was 11.6 gm&. Therapy included digitalization and 
anticoagulation. Later, chlorothiazide and salt restriction became 
necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure. 
Because of increasing anemia, triamcinolone, 8 mg& daily, was started 
on Feb& 23, 1958, and was continued until july, 1958. In september, 
1958, the patient developed generalized weakness and fatigue which 
was concurrent with exacerbation of his anemia; the hemoglobin was 
10.6 gm&. In an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulating 
the bone marrow and controlling any hemolytic component, triamcinolone, 
16 mg& daily, was begun on Sept& 26, 1958, and continued until 
Feb& 18, 1959. At first the patient felt stronger, and the hemoglobin 
rose to 13.8 gm&, but on Oct& 20, 1958, he complained of "caving 
in" in his knees. By Nov& 8, 1958, weakness, specifically 
involving the pelvic and thigh musculature, was pronounced, and a common 
complaint was "difficulty in stepping up on to curbs". Prednisone, 
30 mg& daily, was substituted for triamcinolone from Nov& 
22 until Dec& 1, 1958, without any improvement in the weakness. Serum 
potassium at this time was 3.8 mEq& per liter, and the hemoglobin 
was 13.9 gm& By Dec& 1, 1958, the weakness in the pelvic and 
quadriceps muscle groups was appreciably worse, and it became difficult 
for the patient to rise unaided from a sitting or reclining position. 
Triamcinolone, 16 mg& daily, was resumed and maintained until Feb& 
18, 1959. Chlorothiazide was omitted for a 2-week period, but there 
was no change in the muscle weakness.   At this time a detailed 
neuromuscular examination revealed diffuse muscle atrophy that was 
moderate in the hands and feet, but marked in the shoulders, hips, and 
pelvic girdle, with hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes. No fasciculations 
or sensory defects were found. Electromyography revealed no evidence 
of lower motor neuron disease. Thyroid function tests yielded normal 
results. The protein-bound iodine was 6.6|mg& %, and the radioactive 
iodine uptake over the thyroid gland was 46% in 24 hours, 
with a conversion ratio of 12%. A Schilling test demonstrated normal 
absorption of vitamin **f. In February, 1959, during the second 
admission to The New York Hospital, a biopsy specimen of the left 
gastrocnemius showed striking increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nuclei 
and shrunken muscle fibers in several sections. Serial serum potassium 
levels remained normal; the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 
was 10 units per ml& per min&. The clinical impression at this 
time was either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis.   On Feb& 
12, 1959, purified corticotropin (~ACTH Gel), 20 units daily 
intramuscularly, was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks later 
because of excessive fluid retention. From March 3 to May 1, 1949, 
the patient was maintained on dexamethasone, 3 to 6 mg& daily. In 
May 1959, prednisone, 30 mg& daily, replaced the dexamethasone. Muscle 
weakness did not improve, and the patient needed first a cane, then 
crutches. In spite of normal thyroid function tests, a trial of propylthiouracil, 
400 mg& daily for one week, was given but served only 
to intensify muscle weakness. Repeated attempts to withdraw steroids 
entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle weakness resulted, 
as well as fever, malaise, anorexia, anxiety, and an exacerbation of 
the anemia. These reactions were interpreted as being manifestations 
of hypoadrenocorticism.   Severe back pain in June, 1959, prompted 
a third hospital admission. Extensive osteoporosis with partial 
collapse of ~D8 was found. A high-protein diet, calcium lactate supplements, 
and norethandrolone failed to change the skeletal complaint 
or the severe muscle weakness.   The terminal hospital admission 
on June 27, 1959, was necessitated by continued weakness and debility 
complicated by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids. 
X-ray films of the vertebral column showed progression of the demineralization. 
On July 4, 1959, the patient developed marked abdominal 
pain and distension, went into shock, and died. 

#FINDINGS AT NECROPSY# 

The body was that of a well-developed, somewhat debilitated white 
man weighing 108 lb& There were bilateral pterygia and arcus senilis, 
and the mouth was edentulous.   The heart weighed 510 gm&, 
and at the outflow tracts the left and right ventricles measured 19 
and 3 mm&, respectively. The coronary arteries were sclerotic and 
diffusely narrowed throughout their courses, and the right coronary artery 
was virtually occluded by a yellow atheromatous plaque 1.5 cm& distal 
to its origin. The myocardium of the posterior base of the left 
ventricle was replaced by gray scar tissue over a 7.5 cm& area. The 
valves were normal except for thin yellow plaques on the inferior surface 
of the mitral leaflets. Microscopically, sections from the posterior 
base of the left ventricle of the heart showed several large areas 
of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue. In addition, other sections 
contained focal areas of recent myocardial necrosis that were infiltrated 
with neutrophils. Many of the myocardial fibers were hypertrophied 
and had large, irregular, basophilic nuclei. The intima of the 
larger coronary arteries was thickened by fibrous tissue containing 
fusiform clefts and mononuclear cells.   The intimal surface of 
the aorta was covered with confluent, yellow-brown, hard, friable plaques
