the appropriate information to each occurrence in text. The list of 
text forms in the ~W-region of memory and the contents of the information 
cells in the ~X and ~Y-regions are no longer required. Only 
the assignment of the information cells is important.   The 
first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis 
of the input text. The grammatical description of each occurrence in 
the text must be retrieved from the dictionary to permit such an analysis. 
A description of this process will serve to illustrate how any 
type of information can be retrieved from the dictionary and attached 
to each text occurrence.   The grammatic descriptions of all forms 
in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary 
file. The order is identical to the ordering of the forms they describe. 
When entries are being retrieved from this file, the table of dictionary 
usage indicates which entries to skip and which entries to store 
in the computer. This selection-rejection process takes place as the 
file is read. Each entry that is selected for storage is written into 
the next available cells of the ~W-region. The address of the 
first cell and the number of cells used is written in the information 
cell for the form. (The address of the information cell is also supplied 
by the table of dictionary usage.) When the complete file has been 
read, the grammatic descriptions for all text forms found in the dictionary 
have been stored in the ~W-region; the information cell assigned 
to each text form contains the address of the grammatic description 
of the form it represents. Hence, the description of each text 
occurrence can be retrieved by reading the list of text-ordered information-cell 
addresses and outputting the description indicated by the information 
cell for each occurrence.   The only requirements on 
dictionary information made by the text-lookup operation are that each 
form represented by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form 
list and that information for each form be available in a sequence 
identical with the sequence of the forms. This leaves the ordering 
of entries variable. (Here an entry is a form plus the information 
that pertains to it.)   Two very useful ways for modifying a form-dictionary 
are the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigms 
rather than single forms and the application of a single change to more 
than one dictionary form. The former is intended to decrease the amount 
of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage. The latter is useful 
for modifying information about some or all forms of a word, hence 
reducing the work required to improve dictionary contents. Applying 
the techniques developed at Harvard for generating a paradigm from 
a representative form and its classification, we can add all forms of 
a word to the dictionary at once. An extension of the principle would 
permit entering a grammatic description of each form. Equivalents could 
be assigned to the paradigm either at the time it is added to the 
dictionary or after the word has been studied in context. Thus, one can 
think of a dictionary entry as a word rather than a form.   If 
all forms of a paradigm are grouped together within the dictionary, 
a considerable reduction in the amount of information required is possible. 
For example, the inflected forms of a word can be represented, 
insofar as regular inflection allows, by a stem and a set of endings to 
be attached. (Indeed, the set of endings can be replaced by the <name> 
of a set of endings.) The full forms can be derived from such information 
just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list. 
Similarly, if the equivalents for the forms of a word do not vary, the 
equivalents need be entered only once with an indication that they 
apply 
to each form. The dictionary system is in no way dependent upon 
such summarization or designed around it. When irregularity and variation 
prevent summarizing, information is written in complete detail. Entries 
are summarized only when by doing so the amount of information 
retained in the dictionary is reduced and the time required for dictionary 
operations is decreased. 
In sentences, patterns of stress are determined by complex combinations 
of influences that can only be suggested here. The tendency is toward 
putting dominant stress at the end. There is a parallel to this tendency 
in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tunes. Thus the 
first lines of one of Charles Wesley's hymns are as follows. 
"A charge to keep I have, A God to glorify". In the 
tune to which this hymn is most often sung, "Boylston", the syllables 
<have> and <fy>, ending their lines, have twice the time any 
other syllables have. Dominant stress is of course more than extended 
duration, and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress 
or phrase stress if the words or longer units they are parts of 
were spoken alone: a dominant stress given to <glorify> would normally 
center on its first syllable rather than its last. But the parallel 
is significant. When the answer to <what's wrong now?> is <Bill's 
broken a chair>, dominant stress will usually be on the complement 
<a chair>. From the point of view of syntactic analysis the 
head word in the statement is the predicator <has broken>, and from 
the point of view of meaning it would seem that the trouble centers 
in the breaking; but dominant stress will be assigned to <broken> 
only in rather exceptional versions of the sentence. In <I know one 
thing> dominant stress will usually be on the complement <one thing>; 
in <one thing I know> it will usually be on the predicator <know>. 
In <small-town people are very friendly> dominant stress will 
generally be on the complement <very friendly>; in the double sentence 
<the smaller the town, the friendlier the people> it will generally 
be on the subjects <the town> and <the people>. In <what's 
a linguist?> dominant stress will generally be on the subject 
<a linguist>; in <who's a linguist?> it will generally be on 
the complement <a linguist>. Dominant stress is on <her luggage> 
both in <that's her luggage>, where <her luggage> is the complement, 
and in <there's her luggage>, where it is the subject. Adverbial 
second complements, however, are likely not to have dominant stress 
when they terminate sentences. If the answer to <what was that noise?> 
is <George put the cat out>, dominant stress will ordinarily 
be on the first complement, <the cat>, not the second complement 
<out>. Final adjuncts may or may not have dominant stress. If the 
answer to <what was that noise?> is <George reads the news emotionally>, 
dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct <emotionally>. 
When prepositional complements are divided as in <what are you 
looking for?> they are likely to lose dominant stress.   Context 
is of extreme importance. What is new in the context is likely 
to be made more prominent than what is not. Thus in a context in which 
there has been discussion of snow but mention of local conditions is 
new, dominant stress will probably be on <here> in <it rarely snows 
here>, but in a context in which there has been discussion of local 
weather but no mention of snow, dominant stress will probably be on <snows>. 
The personal pronouns and substitute <one> are normally unstressed 
because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context. 
In <I'll go with George> dominant stress is probably on <George>; 
but if George has just been mentioned prominently (and 
the trip to be made has been under discussion), what is said is probably 
<I'll go with him>, and dominant stress is probably on the preposition 
<with>. When a gesture accompanies <who's he?> the personal 
pronoun has dominant stress because "he" has not been mentioned 
previously. If both George and a piece of information George 
does not have are prominent in the context, but the idea of telling George 
is new, then dominant stress will probably be on <tell> in <why 
not tell George?> But when what is new in a particular context 
is also fairly obvious, there is normally only light stress or no stress 
at all. Thus the unstressed <it> of <it rarely snows here> gets 
its significance from its use with <snows>: nothing can snow snow 
but "it". In <there aren't many young people in the neighborhood> 
the modifier <young> takes dominant stress away from its head 
<people>: the fact that the young creatures of interest are people 
seems rather obvious. If <women> replaced <people>, it would normally 
have dominant stress. In <I have things to do> the word <things> 
makes little real contribution to meaning and has weaker stress 
than <do>. If <work> is substituted for <things> (with more 
exact contribution to meaning), it will have dominant stress. In <I 
know one thing> dominant stress is likely to go to <one> rather than 
to semantically pale <thing>. In <I knew you when you were a child, 
and you were pretty then> dominant stress on <then> implies that 
the young woman spoken to is still pretty. Dominant stress on <pretty> 
would be almost insulting here. In the written language <then> 
can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader here, but much 
of the time the written language simply depends on the reader's alertness, 
and a careless reader will have to back up and reread. 
Often dominant stress simply indicates a centering of attention or emotion. 
Thus in <it's incredible what that boy can eat> dominant stress 
is likely to be on <incredible>, and <eat> will have strong 
stress also. In <she has it in for George> dominant stress will ordinarily 
be on <in>, where the notion of stored-up antipathy seems to 
center. In <we're painting at our garage> strong stress on <at> 
indicates that the job being done is not real painting but simply an 
effort at painting. Where there is comparison or contrast dominant 
stresses normally operate to center attention. Thus in <his friends 
are stranger than his sisters'> strong stresses are normal for <his> 
and <sisters'>, but in <his friends are stranger than his sisters> 
strong stresses are normal for <friends> and <sisters>. In 
<he's hurting himself more than he's hurting you> both <himself> 
and <you> have stronger stress than they would ordinarily have if 
there were no contrast. In <is she Chinese or Japanese?> the 
desire to contrast the first parts of words which are alike in their last 
components produces an exceptional disregard of the normal patterns 
of stress of <Chinese> and <Japanese>. Sometimes strong stress 
serves to focus an important secondary relationship. Thus in <Mary 
wrote an account of the trip first> strong stress on <Mary> marks 
Mary as the first in a series of people who wrote accounts of the trip, 
strong stress on <wrote> marks the writing as the first of a series 
of actions of Mary's concerned with an account of her trip (about 
which she may later have made speeches, for example), and strong stress 
on <trip> makes the trip the first of a series of subjects about 
which Mary wrote accounts. In <hunger stimulates man too> the situation 
is very similar. Strong stress on <hunger> treats hunger as 
an additional stimulus, strong stress on <stimulates> treats stimulation 
as an additional effect of hunger, strong stress on <man> treats 
man as an additional creature who responds to the stimulation of hunger. 
Here again, in the written language it is possible to help the 
reader get his stresses right by using underlining or italics, but much 
of the time there is simply reliance on his understanding in the light 
of context.   When a word represents a larger construction of 
which it is the only expressed part, it normally has more stress than 
it would have in fully expressed construction. Thus when <yes, I 
have> is the response to <have you finished reading the paper?> 
the stress on <have>, which here represents <have finished reading 
the paper>, is quite strong. In <Mack's the leader at camp, but 
Jack is here> the <is> of the second main declarative represents 
<is the leader> and therefore has stress. <Mack's the leader at 
camp, but Jack's here>, with this <is> deprived of stress, makes 
<here> the complement in the clause. In <of all the suggestions that 
were made, his was the silliest> the possessive <his> represents 
<his suggestion> and is stressed. When <go> represents itself and 
a complement (being equivalent, say, to <go to Martinique>) in <which 
boat did Jack go on?> it has strong stress; when it represents 
only itself and <on which> is its complement (so that <go on> 
is semantically equivalent to <board>), <on> has stronger stress 
than <go> does. Omission of a subordinator pronoun, however, does 
not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which 
the subordinator pronoun would be object. Thus <to> has light stress 
both in <that was the conclusion that I came to> and in <that 
was the conclusion I came to>. But when <to> represents <to consciousness> 
in <that was the moment that I came to>, and similarly 
in <that was the moment I came to>, there is much stronger stress 
on <to>. In <I wanted to tell him, but I was afraid to> the final 
<to> is lightly stressed because it represents <to tell him>. In 
<to tell him>, of course, <to> is normally unstressed. When <I 
have instructions to leave> is equivalent in meaning to <I 
have instructions that I am to leave this place>, dominant stress
