Gorton, having foully abused high and low at Aquidneck is now 
bewitching and bemaddening poor Providence, both with his unclean and 
foul censures of all the ministers of this country (for which myself 
have in Christ's name withstood him), and also denying all visible 
and external ordinances in depth of Familism: almost all suck in 
his poison, as at first they did at Aquidneck. Some few and myself withstand 
his inhabitation and town privileges, without confession and 
reformation of his uncivil and inhuman practices at Portsmouth; yet 
the tide is too strong against us, and I fear (if the framer of hearts 
help not) it will force me to little Patience, a little isle next 
to your Prudence". Williams also stated: "Our peace was like 
the peace of a man who hath the tertian ague".   Providence finally 
managed to get Gorton out of the town, and he and some friends 
bought land at Pawtuxet on the west side of Narragansett Bay, five 
miles south but still within the jurisdiction of the Providence colony. 
This town should not be confused with Pawtucket, just north of Providence, 
or Pawcatuck, Connecticut, on the Pawcatuck River, opposite 
Westerly, Rhode Island.   Up to now, Gorton had been looking 
for trouble, and now that he was trying to get away from it, trouble 
started looking for him. Upon intelligence that the formidable 
agitator was to favor them with his presence, the benighted inhabitants 
of Pawtuxet, alas, gave their allegiance to Massachusetts and asked 
that colony to expel the newcomers. As it was the custom of that alert 
colony to take over the property of persons asking for protection, 
this was an act roughly equivalent to throwing open the door to a pack 
of wolves and saying "Come and get it".   Gorton and company, 
however, promptly bought land from Miantonomi a few miles south 
of Pawtuxet, extending from the present Gaspee Point south to Warwick 
Neck and twenty miles inland. The settlement was called Shawomet. 
It was not within the jurisdiction of anybody or anything, including 
Providence and Massachusetts. If Gorton wanted peace and quiet 
for his complicated meditations this is where he should have had it. Instead 
of that he was engulfed by bedlam.   Pomham and Soconoco, 
a couple of minor sachems (of something less than exalted character) 
under Miantonomi, declared that they had never assented to the sale 
of land to Gorton and had never received anything for it. Following 
the glorious lead of the heroes of Pawtuxet, they also submitted themselves 
to the protection of Massachusetts. One historical authority 
presents laborious and circuitous testimony tending to arouse suspicion 
that Massachusetts was behind the clouds settling down on the embattled 
Gorton.   However, the General Court at Boston ordered 
the purchasers of Shawomet to appear before them to answer the sachems' 
claim. The purchasers rejected the order in two letters written 
in vigorous terms. Then Massachusetts switched to its standard tactics. 
It pointed out twenty-six instances of blasphemy in the letters, 
and ordered the writers to submit or force of arms would be used. The 
next week, forty soldiers were sent to get the miscreants. The latter 
tried to arbitrate through a delegation from Providence, which offer 
was declined by the invaders. The Commissioners at Boston wrote 
the victims to see their misdeeds and repent or they should "look upon 
them as men prepared for slaughter".   At Shawomet, women 
and children fled in terror across the Bay. The men fortified a blockhouse 
and got ready to fight, but meanwhile appealed to the King and 
again tried to arbitrate. Gorton evidently still had plenty to learn 
about Massachusetts, but he was learning fast. Governor Winthrop wrote: 
"  You may do well to take notice, that besides the title 
to land between the English and the Indians there, there are twelve 
of the English that have subscribed their names to horrible and detestable 
blasphemies, who are rather to be judged as blasphemous than 
they should delude us by winning time under pretence of arbitration".

The attack started on October 2, 1643, and the Gortonists held 
out for a day and a night. The attackers sent for more soldiers, and 
the defenders, to save bloodshed, surrendered under the promise that 
they would be treated as neighbors. Promptly their livestock was taken 
and according to Gorton the soldiers were ordered to knock down anyone 
who should utter a word of insolence, and run through anyone who 
might step out of line.   When the captives arrived in Boston, 
"the chaplain [of their captors] went to prayers in the open streets, 
that the people might take notice what they had done in a holy manner, 
and in the name of the Lord". Gorton and ten of his friends 
were thrown in jail.   On Sunday they refused to attend church. 
The magistrates were determined to compel them. The prisoners agreed, 
provided they might speak after the sermon, which was permitted. Here 
was Gorton's chance to indulge in something at which he was supreme. 
The Boston elders were great at befuddling the opposition with 
torrents of ecclesiastical obscurities, but Gorton was better. Reverend 
Cotton preached to them about Demetrius and the shrines of Ephesus. 
Gorton replied with blasts that scandalized the congregation.

At the trial which took place later, the Pomham matter was completely 
omitted. The Gortonists were charged with blasphemy and tried 
for their lives. Four ecclesiastical questions were presented by the 
General Court to Gorton: "_1._ Whether the Fathers, who 
died before Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, were justified and 
saved only by the blood which hee shed, and the death which hee suffered 
after his incarnation? _2._ Whether the only price of our 
redemption were not the death of Christ on the cross, with the rest 
of his sufferings and obediences, in the time of his life here, after 
hee was born of the Virgin Mary? _3._ Who was the God whom hee 
thinke we serve? _4._ What hee means when hee saith, wee worship 
the starre of our God Remphan, Chion, Moloch"?   Gorton 
answered in writing. All of the elders except three voted for death, 
but a majority of the deputies refused to sanction the sentence. 
Seven of the prisoners were sentenced to be confined in irons for as 
long as it pleased the court, set to work and, if they broke jail or proclaimed 
heresy, to be executed if convicted. The three others got off 
easier. The convicts were put in chains, paraded before the congregation 
at the Reverend Cotton's lecture as an example, and sent to 
prisons in various towns, where they languished all winter, chains included. 
When Fred wheeled him back into his room, the big one looking out on 
the back porch, and put him to bed, Papa told him he was very tired 
but that he had enjoyed greatly the trip downtown. "I've been cooped 
up so long", he added. Getting out again, seeing old friends, 
had given his spirits a lift.   That night after supper I went 
back over to 48 Spruce Street- Ralph and I at that time were living 
at 168 Chestnut- and Ralph went with me. Papa was still elated 
over his afternoon visit downtown. "Baby, I saw a lot of old friends 
I hadn't seen in a long time", he told me, his eyes bright. 
"It was mighty good for the old man to get out again".   The 
next day he seemed to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent 
spirits. But a few days after Fred's return he began hemorrhaging 
and that was the beginning of early and complete disintegration. It 
began in the morning, and very quickly the hemorrhage was a massive one. 
We got Dr& Glenn to him as quickly as we could, and we wired 
Tom of Papa's desperate condition. The hemorrhage was in the prostate 
region; Dr& Glenn saw at once what had happened.   "He 
has lost much blood", he said. "It'll take a lot to replace 
it".   "Dr& Glenn, I've got a lot of blood", Fred 
spoke up, "plenty of it. Let me give Papa blood".   The doctor 
agreed, but explained that it would be necessary first to check Fred's 
blood to ascertain whether or not it was of the same type as 
Papa's. To give a patient the wrong type of blood, said the doctor, 
would likely kill him.   That was in the days before blood banks, 
of course, and transfusions had to be given directly from donor to 
patient. One had to find a donor, and usually very quickly, whose blood 
corresponded with the patient's. And then it took considerably 
longer to make preparations for giving transfusions. They had to take 
blood samples to the laboratory to test them, for one thing, and there 
was much required preliminary procedure.   They made the tests 
and came to Fred; by now it was perhaps two days or longer after Papa 
had begun hemorrhaging.   "Fred, your blood matches your 
father's, all right", Dr& Glenn said. "But we aren't going 
to let you give him any".   "But why in the name of God can't 
I give my father blood"? Fred demanded. "Why can't I, 
Doctor"?   "Because, Fred, it could do him no good. It's 
too late now. He's past helping. He's as good as gone".

And in a few minutes Papa was dead. It was well past midnight. 
Papa had left us about the same hour of the night that Ben had passed 
on. The date was June 20, 1922.   "W& O& Wolfe, 
prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section, died shortly 
after midnight Tuesday at his home 48 Spruce Street", the Asheville 
<Times> of Wednesday, June 21, announced. "Mr& Wolfe 
had been in declining health for many years and death was not unexpected". 
A biographical sketch followed.   Funeral services were 
held Thursday afternoon at four o'clock at the home. Beloved Dr& 
R& F& Campbell, our First Presbyterian Church pastor, was 
in charge. The burial was out in Riverside Cemetery. All about him 
stood tombstones his own sensitive great hands had fashioned.

A few years before his death Papa had agreed with Mama to make a 
joint will with her in which it would be provided that in the event of 
the 
death of either of them an accounting would be made to their children 
whereby each child would receive a bequest of $5000 cash. At his death 
Fred and Ralph, my husband, were named executors of the estate under 
the terms of the will.   Fred and Ralph qualified as executors 
and paid off what debts were currently due, and they were all current, 
since Papa was never one to allow bills to go unpaid. The bills 
were principally for hospitalization and doctors' fees during the 
last years of his life, and when he died he owed in the main only current 
doctor's bills. After they had paid all his debts and the funeral 
costs, Ralph and Fred had some fourteen thousand dollars, as I remember, 
with which to pay the bequests. This, manifestly, would not 
provide $5000 to each of the surviving five children.   So what 
Fred and Ralph did was to attempt to prorate the money fairly by taking 
into account what each of the five had received, if anything, from 
the estate before Papa's death. Consequently, Fred and Tom, the 
two who had been provided college educations, signed statements to the 
effect that each had received his bequest in full, and Effie and I 
were each allotted $5000. Frank had been given about half his legacy 
to use in a business venture before Papa's death; he was given the 
difference between that amount and $5000. Tom had received four years 
of education at the University of North Carolina and two at Harvard, 
and Fred had been in and out of Georgia Tech and Carneigie 
Tech and part of the time had been a self-help student. So, because 
he had received less than Tom, it was felt proper that Fred should receive 
the few hundred dollars that remained. And that's how Papa's 
estate was divided.   Papa, I should emphasize, had been an 
invalid the last several years of his life; his hospital and doctor 
bills had been large and his income had been cut until he was receiving 
little except 
small rentals on some properties he still owned. Had 
he been able to escape this long siege of invalidism, I'm convinced, 
Papa would have left a sizable estate. But he had succeeded well, 
we agreed. 
He had left us a legacy far more valuable than houses and lands 
and stocks and bonds.   For years Papa and Mama had been large 
taxpayers. I recall that several years their taxes exceeded $800. 
In those years of lower property valuations and lower tax rates, that 
payment represented ownership of much property.   "Merciful God, 
Julia"! I have known Papa to exclaim on getting his tax bill, 
"we're going to the dogs"!   But he never expected to 
do that. And he didn't, by a long shot!
