he says. "The hand is out".   A political scientist writes 
of the growth of "alienated voters", who "believe that voting 
is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are 
corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control. **h These voters view the 
political process as a secret conspiracy, the object of which is to 
plunder them".   Corruption is hardly a recent development in 
the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin 
O'Connor's novel, "The Last Hurrah". But there are reasons 
for the current spotlight on the subject.   A succession of 
highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year. 
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought 
on state and Federal investigations. And the election of President 
Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of 
his home state.   A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly 
escape the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the norm in 
Massachusetts 
public life. Day after day some new episode is reported.

The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent 
$8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront 
property. An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate. 

_WASHINGTON, JUNE 18_- Congress starts another week tomorrow with 
sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.   In the 
Senate, several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict 
or opposition. In the House, the Southern-Republican coalition is 
expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's 
housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an attempt 
to advance the aid-to-education bill.   The housing bill is now 
in the House Rules Committee. It is expected to be reported out Tuesday, 
but this is a little uncertain.   The panel's action depends 
on the return of Representative James W& Trimble, Democrat 
of Arkansas, who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces 
in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor. Mr& Trimble 
has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday. 

#LEADERSHIP 
IS HOPEFUL#

The housing bill is expected to encounter strong 
opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative 
Republicans. The Democratic leadership, however, hopes to pass it 
sometime this week.   The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed 
last Monday by the Senate, provides for forty-year mortgages at low 
down-payments for moderate-income families. It also provides for funds 
to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories.   The education 
bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee, 
where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the 
Administration are balking because of the religious controversy. They 
are James J& Delaney of Queens and Thomas P& O'Neill Jr& 
of Massachusetts. 

#THREE GROUPS TO MEET#

What could rescue 
the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National 
Defense Education Act of 1958. This would provide for long-term 
Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school 
facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.

Mr& Delaney and Mr& O'Neill are not willing to vote on the 
public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House 
Education and Labor Committee.

About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary 
agencies will be carried out by religious groups, according to an official 
of the corps.   In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted 
for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent through 
universities and private voluntary agencies.   Twelve projects 
proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage, Gordon 
Boyce, director of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in 
a Washington interview. Six of these were proposed by religious groups. 
They will be for teaching, agriculture and community development 
in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. 

#QUESTION RAISED#

Interviews with several church leaders have disclosed 
that this development has raised the question whether the Peace 
Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over 
methods, means and goals.   There are a number of ways this could 
happen, the churchmen pointed out, and here is an example: 
Last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came 
to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled. When he protested, 
the hotel owner said:   "Why do you worry? The 
U& S& Government is paying for it. The U& S& Government 
pays for all its overseas workers". 

#MISSIONARY 
EXPLAINS#

"I don't work for the Government", the American 
said. "I'm a missionary".   The hotel owner shrugged. 
"Same thing", he said.   And then, some churchmen remarked, 
there is a more classical church-state problem:   Can religious 
agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their 
projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation 
of church and state?   R& Sargent Shriver Jr&, director 
of the corps, is certain that they can. No religious group, he 
declared in an interview, will receive Peace Corps funds unless it 
forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes. 

_MOSCOW, JUNE 18_- At a gay party in the Kremlin for President 
Sukarno of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets 
and said, beaming: "Look, he took everything I had"! 
Mr& Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful 
banker. Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of 
Asia, Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid.

The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly 
expanding their economic, technical and military assistance to 
the uncommitted nations.   The Communist countries allocated more 
than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year, according to Western 
estimates. This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist 
program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning 
in 1954. In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present 
in those countries. 

_UNITED NATIONS, N& Y&, JUNE 18_- A committee of experts has 
recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution 
of professional posts at the United Nations. This was disclosed 
today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet 
Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United 
Nations.   One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium 
on population instead of economic strength, as in the past, would 
be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries 
as India. India is the most populous United Nations member with more 
than 400,000,000 inhabitants.   The new formula for filling 
staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations 
made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report. The report 
was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of 
the organization of the United Nations. 

#FORMULA IS DUE THIS WEEK# 

The Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions 
is expected to receive the report this week. The jobs formula is 
understood to follow these lines: _@_ Each of the organization's 
ninety-nine members would get two professional posts, such as 
political affairs officer, a department head or an economist, to start. 
#@#

Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people 
in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts. 
#@#

Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would 
get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to 
an unspecified cut-off point. 

_GENEVA, JUNE 18_- The three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin 
negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would 
unite the war-ridden kingdom.   The decision was made in Zurich 
by Prince Boun Oum, Premier of the pro-Western royal Government; 
Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists 
and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and Prince Souphanouvong, 
head of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao forces. The latter 
two are half-brothers.   Their 
joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend 
tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference 
on the future of Laos. An agreement among the Princes on a coalition 
government would ease their task, diplomats conceded. But no 
one was overly optimistic. 

#TACTICS STUDIED IN GENEVA#

W& Averell 
Harriman of the United States, Malcolm MacDonald of Britain, 
Maurice Couve de Murville, France's Foreign Minister, and Howard 
C& Green, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, concluded, 
meanwhile, a round of consultations here on future tactics in the 
conference. The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week.

Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter, 
read the Princes' statement. They had a two-hour luncheon together 
in "an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation", she 
said.   The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for 
their talks, which are to last three days.   The Princess said 
it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached 
after three days. 

#TO DEAL WITH PRINCIPLES#

The meetings in 
Zurich, the statement said, would deal only with principles that would 
guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government.

Appointment of William S& Pfaff Jr&, 41, as promotion 
manager 
of The Times-Picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday 
by John F& Tims, president of the company.   Pfaff succeeds 
Martin Burke, who resigned.   The new promotion manager 
has been employed by the company since January, 1946, as a commercial 
artist in the advertising department.   He is a native of New 
Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school, Fortier High school 
and Soule business 
college.   From June, 1942, until December, 
1945, Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps. While in the service 
he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville, Ill&.
