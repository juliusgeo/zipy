times to give reliable impact rates for the periods of exposure. 
Many other vehicles with smaller sensitive-area exposure-time products 
contribute some information.   The impact rate on 1958 Alpha 
for 153 events was **f for particles of mass greater than **f (Dubin, 
1960); this mass threshold was derived from the detector calibration 
and an assumed impact velocity of **f. The data show daily and diurnal 
variations. Ninety per cent of the 153 recorded impacts occurred 
between midnight and noon, and from day to day the variation of the rate 
was as much as an order of magnitude. One may conclude that most 
of the detected micrometeoritic material is concentrated in orbital streams 
which intersect the Earth's orbit.   There have been contradictory 
reports from 1958 Delta 2, and the data quoted here are believed 
to be the more reliable. On May 15, a very large increase occurred 
with **f of mass between **f and **f; for the next two days, 
the impact rate was **f; and for the next nine days, the impact rate 
was less than **f (Nazarova, 1960). The data for the first day indicate 
a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particles and may 
have led to the high estimates of micrometeorite flux.   Preliminary 
data from 1959 Eta give an average impact rate of **f for masses 
larger than **f for about 1000 events in a 22-day period (LaGow 
and Alexander, 1960). The day-to-day rate varied by less than a factor 
of 4.5. The data have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations. 
Note that the mass threshold is four times that of 1958 Alpha and 
that the flux is one fifth as large. If one assumes that the average 
flux did not change between measurements, a mass-distribution curve is 
obtained which relates the flux of particles larger than a given radius 
to the inverse 7/2 power of the radius.   Space probes have 
yielded little information. Pioneer /1, recorded a decrease in flux 
with distance from the Earth on the basis of 11 counts in 9 hours. With 
detectors 
sensitive to three mass intervals and based on a few counts, 
the second and third Russian space probes indicate that the flux 
of the smallest particles detected is less than that of larger ones. 
Being based on so few events, these results are of dubious validity.

The calibration of piezoelectric sensors in terms of the particle 
parameters is very uncertain. Many workers believe that the response 
is proportional to the incident momentum of the particles, a relation 
deduced from laboratory results linearly extrapolated to meteoritic 
velocities. However, one must expect that vaporization and ejection 
of material by hypervelocity impacts would cause a deviation from a linear 
relationship. In the United States, most of the sensors are calibrated 
by dropping small spheres on their sensitive surfaces. The 
Russian experimenters claim that only a small fraction of the impulse 
from the sensors is caused by the incident momentum with the remainder 
being momentum of ejected material from the sensor. This "ejection" 
momentum is linearly related to the particle energy. They quote 
about the same mass threshold as that of the U&S& apparatus, but 
a momentum threshold about 40 times greater. There is a difference 
in the experimental arrangement, in that the U&S& microphones are 
attached directly to the vehicle skin while the Russian instruments 
are isolated from the skin. The threshold mass is derived from the 
momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of **f 
in the U&S& work and **f in the 
U&S&S&R& work. The threshold 
mass of about **f corresponds to a 10-~|m-diameter sphere of 
density **f. However, the conversion from mass to size is unreliable, 
since many photographic meteors give evidence of a fluffy, loosely bound 
meteorite structure with densities as low as **f. To what extent 
such low density applies to micrometeorites is unknown. The velocity 
value used is also open to some question; if a substantial fraction 
of the dust is orbiting about the Earth, only about one third the above-mentioned 
average velocity should be used in deriving the mass. Zodiacal 
light and the <gegenschein> give some evidence for such a dust 
blanket, a phenomenon also to be expected if the dust before capture 
is in circular orbits about the sun, as indicated by the trend of the 
smaller visible meteors. The diurnal variation in the observed flux 
may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the 
incident velocity.   The flux of micrometeorites in the neighborhood 
of the Earth can be estimated by extrapolation from radar and 
visual meteor data. A summary of meteorite data, prepared by Whipple 
(1958) on the basis of photographic, visual, and radar evidence, 
is given in Table 5-1. From an estimated mass of 25 ~g for a 
zero-magnitude meteorite, the other masses are derived with the assumption 
of a mass decrease by a factor of 2.512 for each unit increase in 
magnitude. The radius is calculated from the mass by assuming spheres 
of density **f except for the smallest particles, which must have a 
higher mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of 
solar-radiation pressure. The flux values are for all particles with 
masses greater than the given mass and are based on an estimate of the 
numbers of visual meteors. It is assumed that the flux values increase 
by a factor of 2.512 per magnitude, in accordance with the opinion 
that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude is constant. 
The values agree with the data from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta. The figures 
in the next-to-last column are derived with the assumption of 50 
per cent shielding by the Earth; hence, these figures apply immediately 
above the Earth's atmosphere. The unshielded flux is given 
in the last column; these figures constitute the best estimate for the 
flux in interplanetary space near the Earth. Of course, if there 
is a dust blanket around the Earth, the fluxes in interplanetary space 
should be less than the figures given here.   Note that the mass 
scale is one to two orders of magnitude greater than some previously 
used; for example, Jacchia (1948) derived a scale of 0.15 ~g for 
a **f, zero-magnitude meteorite. The older scales were based on theoretical 
estimates of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into 
light. The mass scale used in Table 5-1 was derived on the assumption 
that the motion of the glowing trail is related to the momentum 
transfer to the trail by the meteorite, permitting the calculation of 
the mass if the velocity is known (Cook and Whipple, 1958). 
A concentration distribution has been derived from radar observations 
sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude (Manning and Eshleman, 1959). 
Extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude covers 
the range of micrometeorites. The approximate equation is **f, 
where ~<n> 
is the number of **f with electron line-density greater than 
or equal to **f, and ~<q> is proportional to the mass of the meteorite. 
Therefore, ~<n> is inversely proportional to the radius cubed 
and in fair agreement with the inverse 7/2 power derived from 1958 Alpha 
and 1959 Eta data. At the fifteenth magnitude, **f, and at the twenty-fifth 
magnitude, **f. These extrapolated fluxes are about an order 
of magnitude less than the values from the satellite data and the 
figures in Whipple's table. The extrapolation may be in error for 
several reasons. The observational data determining the concentration 
distribution have a range of error which is magnified in the extension 
into the micrometeorite region. The solar-electromagnetic- and 
corpuscular-radiation 
pressure and the associated Poynting-Robertson effect 
increase in effectiveness as the particle size decreases and modify 
the distribution and limit sizes to larger than a few microns. Also, 
it has been suggested that the source of all or part of the dust may 
not be the same as that for visual or radar meteorites (Best, 1960), 
and the same distribution would not be expected. 

#5.4. INDIRECT INDICATIONS 
OF MICROMETEORITE FLUX#

A measure of the total mass accretion 
of meteoritic material by the Earth is obtained from analyses of 
deep-sea sediments and dust collected in remote regions (Pettersson, 
1960). 
Most meteoritic material, by the time it reaches the Earth's 
surface, has been reduced to dust or to spherules of ablated material 
in its passage through the atmosphere. For all meteorites, the average 
nickel content is about 2.5 per cent. This is much higher than the 
nickel content of terrestrial dusts and sediments and provides a basis 
for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx. Present data 
indicate an accretion of about **f tons per year over the entire globe, 
or about **f. 

#BIOLOGICAL WARFARE#

Biological warfare is the intentional use of 
living microorganisms or their toxic products for the purpose of destroying 
or reducing the military effectiveness of man. It is the exploitation 
of the inherent potential of infectious disease agents by scientific 
research and development, resulting in the production of ~BW 
weapons systems. Man may also be injured secondarily by damage to 
his food crops or domestic animals.   Biological warfare is considered 
to be primarily a strategic weapon. The major reason for this 
is that it has no quick-kill effect. The incubation period of infectious 
disease, plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect, 
render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter. A man 
can be an effective fighting machine throughout the incubation period 
of most infectious diseases. Thus, an enemy would probably use this weapon 
for attack on static population centers such as large cities.

An important operational procedure in ~BW for an enemy would 
be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area. This 
concept has stimulated much basic research concerning the behavior of 
particulate biological materials, the pathogenesis of respiratory infections, 
the medical management of such diseases and defense against their 
occurrence.   The biological and physical properties of infectious 
particles have been studied intensively during the past fifteen 
years. Much new equipment and many unique techniques have been developed 
for the quantitative exposure of experimental animals to aerosols 
of infectious agents contained in particles of specified dimensional 
characteristics. Much information has been gathered relative to quantitative 
sampling and assesment techniques. Much of the older experimental 
work on respiratory infections was accomplished by very artificial 
procedures. The intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious 
agent in an anesthetized animal is far different from exposure, 
through natural respiration, to aerosolized organisms.   The 
importance of particle size in such aerosols has been thoroughly demonstrated. 
The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features 
of the upper respiratory tract, such as the turbinates of the nose and 
the cilia of the trachea and larger bronchi, are capable of impinging 
out the larger particles to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily 
existence. Very small particles, however, in a size range of 1 to 
4 microns in diameter are capable of passing these impinging barriers 
and entering the alveolar bed of the lungs. This area is highly susceptible 
to infection. The entrance and retention of infectious particles 
in the alveoli amounts almost to an intratissue inoculation. The 
relationship between particle size and infectious dose is illustrated 
in Table 1.   In considering ~BW defense, it must be recognized 
that a number of critical meterological parameters must be met for 
an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect. For example, bright sunlight 
is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms suspended in air. There 
are optimal humidity requirements for various agents when airborne. 
Neutral or inversion meteorological conditions are necessary for a 
cloud to travel along the surface. It will rise during lapse conditions. 
There are, of course, certain times during the 24-hour daily cycle 
when most of these conditions will be met.   Certain other properties 
of small particles, in addition to those already mentioned in 
connection with penetration of the respiratory tract, are noteworthy 
in defense considerations. The smaller the particle the further it will 
travel downwind before settling out. An aerosol of such small particles. 
moreover, diffuses through structures in much the same manner as 
a gas. There may be a number of secondary effects resulting from diffusion 
through buildings such as widespread contamination of kitchens, 
restaurants, food stores, hospitals, etc&. Depending on the organism,
