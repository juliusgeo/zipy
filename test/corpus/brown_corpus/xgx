is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those 
who love it **h".   Dartmouth is today still a small college- 
and still a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.   This 
is not out of keeping with its origins, probably the most humble of 
any in the Ivy group. Eleazar Wheelock, a Presbyterian minister, 
founded the school in 1769, naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth, 
its sponsor and benefactor. Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain, 
found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands 
built the first College Hall, a log hut dedicated "for the education 
+ instruction of Youth of the Indian Tribes in this Land in reading, 
writing + all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and 
expedient for civilizing + christianizing Children of Pagans as well 
as in all liberal Arts and Sciences; and also of English Youth 
and any others".   It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's 
was indeed "a voice crying in the wilderness". A road had to 
be 
hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to 
permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first 
Dartmouth commencement in 1771. The governor and his retinue thoughtfully 
brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still 
one of the cherished possessions of the college.   The exuberance 
on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings. 
A student orator "produced tears from a great number of the learned" 
even before the punch was served. Then from the branches of a 
near-by tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform and 
the English language, harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue. 
Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green 
beneath the three-hundred-foot pines, and a barrel of rum was broached. 
The cook got drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man 
of broad talents by carving the ox himself.   Future commencements 
were more decorous perhaps, but the number of graduates increased 
from the original four at a relatively slow pace. By the end of the 
nineteenth 
century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and Penn 
were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine. 
The dormitories, including the beloved Dartmouth Hall, could barely 
house two hundred students in Spartan fashion.   Then in 1893 
Dr& William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's 
great awakening began. He transformed Dartmouth from a small New 
Hampshire institution into a national college. By 1907 the number of 
undergraduates had risen to 1,107. And at his last commencement, in 
that year, Dr& Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence 
of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the 
college. The presidents of Cornell, Wisconsin, C&C&N&Y&, 
Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard 
and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.

Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today, with approximately 
twenty-nine hundred undergraduates. But it has achieved a 
cross-section of students from almost all the states, and two-thirds of 
its undergraduates come from outside New England. Over 450 different 
schools are usually represented in each entering class. Only a dozen 
or so schools send as many as six students, and there are seldom more 
than fifteen men in any single delegation. About two-thirds of the 
boys now come from public schools.   It is still a college only 
and not a university; it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy 
group. However, three distinguished associated graduate schools offer 
professional curriculums- the Dartmouth Medical School (third oldest 
in the country and founded in 1797), the Thayer School of Engineering, 
and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. All 
three are purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment of 
about two hundred.   All three schools coordinate their educational 
programs with that of the undergraduate college and, like the college 
proper, 
place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation 
for specialized study. Students of the college who are candidates 
for the A&B& degree and can satisfy the academic requirements 
of the medical and business schools, may enter either of these associated 
schools at the beginning of senior year, thus completing the 
two-year postgraduate course in one year. The Thayer School offers 
a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins 
a B&S& in engineering.   So Dartmouth is moving closer 
to the others in the Ivy group. It is still, however, the junior member 
of the League, if not in years at least in the catching up it has 
had to do. It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span 
the other Ivies have enjoyed. However much football has been over-emphasized, 
the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by 
the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its record a thought again 
since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth 
had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national 
recognition.   It has come on with a rush in more significant areas. 
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions 
might consider somewhat breathtaking. But Dartmouth preserves 
its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes, and, although 
some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage, they 
make for lively copy.   President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed 
to corral an "aristocracy of brains" in Hanover. 
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified. It was 
a busy street, conveniently near the shopping center, and unattended 
horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.   There are, 
of course, many weaknesses in any case against Emma. She didn't like 
her stepmother, but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before 
the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage. She had no 
way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed. 
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized 
during her travels. If she avoided the train and hired a buggy, 
the stableman might have recognized her. If police had checked on 
her more thoroughly than is indicated, she would be completely eliminated 
as a suspect. ##

Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate 
popular suspect. His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden 
home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him, 
although he clearly intended to stay overnight, if not longer.

Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were 
in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders, she had been 
disturbed by their voices and had closed her door, even though it was 
a very hot day.   It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything 
she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse. At that 
time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S& Phillips. 
A few years ago, not too long before his death, Phillips revealed 
in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders. 
He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that 
day, information which must have come from Lizzie. It was obviously 
the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door.

The New Bedford <Standard-Times> has reported Knowlton 
as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew what Borden said 
during his conversation with Morse, he would have convicted "somebody". 
Notice, Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a 
conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden. He said he would have convicted 
"somebody".   It is known that Morse did associate with 
a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at 
Westport, a town not far from Fall River. They were a vagabond lot 
and considered to be shady and undesirable characters. Fall River police 
did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against 
Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from 
among these men. These officers found no incriminating information.

Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed. He said he 
returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar. The woman 
in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said 
she left when he did to shop for her dinner. Fall River is not a 
fashionable town. The dinner hour there was twelve noon. If this woman 
had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping, she would have 
had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was 
eaten at dinner in those days. It is possible that Morse told the woman 
it was 11:20, but it could have been earlier, since she did serve 
dinner on time. Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi. 
They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he 
had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger. Questioned 
further, Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding 
on the same car with him. The conductor did recall having priests 
as passengers and this satisfied police, although the conductor also 
pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests 
riding on almost every trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement 
really proved nothing.   We do know that Morse left the house 
before nine o'clock. Bridget testified she saw him leave through the 
side door. Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door. 
From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked 
leisurely to where his niece was staying, more than a mile away. 
He met nobody he knew on this walk. There is no accounting of his movements 
in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs& 
Borden was killed.   Morse testified that while he was having 
breakfast in the dining room, Mrs& Borden told the servant, "Bridget, 
I want you to wash these windows today". Bridget's testimony 
was in direct contradiction. She said it was after she returned 
from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs& Borden told 
her to wash the windows. This was long after Morse had left the house.

Morse's knowledge of what Mrs& Borden told Bridget could 
indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden 
there. He knew the house fairly well, he had been there on two previous 
visits during the past three or four months alone. And despite Knowlton's 
attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than 
a drum, this was not true. The screen door was unlocked for some ten 
or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back. It was unlocked 
all the time she was washing windows. Morse could have returned 
openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room 
he had occupied. Mrs& Borden would not have been alarmed if she 
saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand. He had been to the farm 
the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet 
at the farm. Mrs& Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him 
and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she 
could cry out. He could have left for Weybosset Street after her 
murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.   If 
he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return, he could 
have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr& Borden came 
home. With Lizzie in the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget 
upstairs in her attic room, he would have had free and easy access to 
the house. With the second murder over, he could have left, hidden the 
weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood. 
His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, 
with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding 
the side door, was odd. There was no close examination of his 
clothes for bloodstains, and certainly no scientific test was made of 
them. And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing, 
a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.

The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel; there was 
no financial gain for Morse in the murders.   On the other side 
of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with 
whom she was staying. The time would have been shortly after the 
murder of Mrs& Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior. 
He said he had promised Mrs& Borden to return in time for dinner 
and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden 
house. ##
