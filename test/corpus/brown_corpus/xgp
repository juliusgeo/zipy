if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's 
on maneuvers. In combat, helping your ~CO make a fool of himself 
might mean getting yourself killed. But in maneuvers, with the top 
brass watching him all the time, it's easy.   Chandler understood 
this and expected the worst. But his first few days with Troop 
~H were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert 
Early. Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice. 
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident. He had 
enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately 
set about learning his new trade. There was no weapon Early could not 
take apart and reassemble blind-folded. He could lead a patrol and 
he knew his paper work. Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's 
correspondence courses. He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, 
history and literature as well.   But for all his erudite 
confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold. 
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh. That saved 
Mel Chandler. Sergeant Early let the new ~CO know just how lucky 
he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United 
States Army. He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and 
the regiment. For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry 
under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the 
Battle of The Little Big Horn.   It didn't take Captain 
Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition 
on his shoulders as commander of Troop ~H. But what made the 
load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper 
was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop 
and the regiment.   Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison 
duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them. It was the 
7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial 
Palace of the Emperor. But still Mel Chandler was not completely 
convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, "Garryowen". 
The final proof was a small incident.   It happened 
at the St& Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which 
had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains 
of an Irish march. In the middle of the party Chandler looked 
up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above 
the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen. The faces belonged 
to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children. And 
when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish 
songs the best.   Though there was an occasional good-natured 
chuckle about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago, 
singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really thought it was strange. 
For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni Martini, the bugler boy 
who carried Custer's last message, or Margarito Lopez, the one-man 
Army on Leyte, was a Garryowen, through and through. It was no 
coincidence 
that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders 
in the regiment.   And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen. 
He set out to keep Troop ~H the best troop in the best regiment. 
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man- cook 
and clerk as well as rifleman- qualified with every weapon in the 
troop. Even the mess sergeant, Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer 
from an airborne division, went out on the range.   The troop received 
a new leader, Lieutenant Robert M& Carroll, fresh out of 
~ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status. Carroll was sharp 
and military, but he was up against tough competition for that ~RA 
berth, and he wanted to play it cool. So Mel Chandler set out to 
sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold 
a short time before.   When the Korean war began, on June 25, 
1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the 
Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead 
of Leyte during World War /2,, the 7th Cavalry was not in the 
best fighting condition. Its entire complement of non-commissioned 
officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit, 
and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World 
War /2,.   Just a month after the Korean War broke out, 
the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat. From 
then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting 
in Korea.   One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler 
called on that fabled <esprit de corps>. The regiment was dug in 
on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building 
up a concentration of crack troops on the other side. The troopers 
knew an attack was coming, but they didn't know when, and they 
didn't know where. At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12, they 
were in doubt no longer. Then it came, against Troop ~H.

The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full 
force of 1000 men, armed with Russian machine guns, attacked the position 
held by Chandler's men. They came in waves. First came the 
cannon fodder, white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive 
human battering ram. They were followed by crack North Korean troops, 
who mounted one charge after another. They overran the 7th Cav's 
forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers, over 
piles of their own dead.   Another force flanked the company 
and took up a position on a hill to the rear. Captain Chandler saw 
that it was building up strength. He assembled a group of 25 men, composed 
of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply 
men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill. One of the more 
seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking 
for the Regular Army. Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill 
to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.   Then 
Mel Chandler started up the hill. He took one step, two, broke 
into a trot and then into a run. The first thing he knew the words "Garryowen"! 
burst from his throat. His followers shouted the old 
battle cry after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.

The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned 
down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire. Chandler, looking to 
right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure 
bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry 
as he ran. It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued 
with the spirit of Garryowen. He had formed his own task force 
of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge. 
Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been 
pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again. But an enemy 
grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously. He 
went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face 
of 
the withering enemy fire.   Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, 
seeking a soft spot. They found it at the junction between Troops 
~H and ~G, and prepared to counterattack. Marvin Goulding saw 
what was happening. He turned to his platoon. "Okay, men", he 
said. "Follow me". Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward, 
"Garryowen"! on his lips, his men following. But the bullets 
whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding 
fell dead. For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that 
their lieutenant, 
the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead. 
Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming 
and hollering "Garryowen"! they charged into the enemy like 
wild men.   That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant 
Carroll had begun. Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy 
soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack. Reinforcements 
came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's 
platoon. The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled 
across the rice paddies. Artillery and air strikes were called in 
to kill them by the hundreds.   Though Bob Carroll seemed to have 
had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived. 
Today he is a major- in the Regular Army.   So filled 
was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was 
over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment. 
After years of digging, nights and weekends, he put together the 
big, profusely illustrated book, <Of Garryowen and Glory>, which 
is probably the most complete history of any military unit. ##

The 
battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle 
cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off. For nearly 
a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the 
regiment.   Take the case of Major Marcus A& Reno, who survived 
the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876. From the enlisted 
men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried 
to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus 
Reno. Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him. But 
when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice 
made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield 
and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left 
to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him. 
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.   Although it was 
at 
the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been 
written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry 
first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by 
then. Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's 
first permanent commander and, like such generals as George 
S& Patton and Terry de la Mesa Allen in their rise to military 
prominence, 
Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.   During 
the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant record, was 
made 
brigadier general at the age of 23.   He finished the war as 
a major general, commanding a full division, and at 25 was the youngest 
major general in the history of the U& S& Army. 
I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in 
the sense that everyone agrees with them. If they were, Walter Lippmann 
would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herblock 
would have nothing to draw cartoons about. I do mean, however, that 
<I> take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying 
would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions. _ASSUMPTION 
1._ The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish 
a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom 
and justice and peace and material prosperity; and in particular- 
since this is our special responsibility- that these conditions 
be enjoyed by the people of the United States. I speak of "the largest 
possible measure" because any person who supposes that these 
conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved- ever- reckons 
without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human 
beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around. _ASSUMPTION 
2._ These conditions are unobtainable- are not even approachable 
in the qualified sense I have indicated- without the prior defeat 
of world Communism. This is true for two reasons: because Communism 
is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions; 
and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet 
power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization. Moreover, 
as Communist power increases, the enjoyment of these conditions 
throughout the world diminishes <pro rata> and the possibility of 
their restoration becomes increasingly remote. _ASSUMPTION 3._ It 
follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal 
of American policy. Proximate in the sense that there are more distant, 
more "positive" ends we seek, to which victory over Communism 
is but a means. But dominant in the sense that every other objective, 
no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it. Peace is a worthy 
objective; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the 
Communists out of Berlin, then we must fight. Freedom, in the sense 
of self-determination, is a worthy objective; but if granting self-determination 
to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into 
the Sino-Soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed. Justice 
is a worthy objective; but if justice for Bantus entails driving 
the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West, 
then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards
