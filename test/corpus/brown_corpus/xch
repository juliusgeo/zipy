and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South. 
It is a "stair-step" plan, in which desegregation begins in 
the first grade. Each year another grade is added to the process, until 
finally all 12 grades are integrated. The schedules are flexible 
so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant 
or realizes that it is something that has to be done, "so why 
not now".   The program has worked well in both Nashville and 
Houston. It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans, where the two schools 
selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by 
white parents. Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans 
to resume the program.   Generally, throughout the South, 
there is a 
growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every 
step of desegregation is met.   Perhaps the most eloquent move 
toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas. During the summer, 
Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants 
and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments. It was part 
of a citywide move toward full integration.   So successful has 
been this program, worked out by white and Negro civic leaders, that 
further extensions are expected in the next few months. Hotels, for 
example, are ready to let down the bars. Already, at least one hotel 
has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis. Several conventions 
have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated 
basis.   This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions 
which prevailed several years ago, when a series of bombings was directed 
against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods 
of Dallas.   It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude 
which appears to be spreading all across the South. Southern 
whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence 
to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights. They insist 
they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama 
when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination 
in local bus depots.   All across the South there are signs 
that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves 
would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant 
attitude toward it.   There are many causes for this change. One 
of the most important is economic. Business leaders are aware now 
that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence. They are putting 
strong pressure on their police departments to keep order. In the 
past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way.

And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real sense of 
co-operation 
has sprung up. This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites 
to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation. They 
realize that by acting in concert, rather than individually, they will 
not be picked out as objects of retaliation- economic and 
otherwise.

Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a 
few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship. 
Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles, it goes like 
this:   A driver cruising easily at 70 m&p&h& in Lane 
~A of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead. Traffic 
in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes 
a tentative fender into Lane ~B, which is heavily populated by cars 
also moving at 70 m&p&h&.   The adjacent driver in Lane 
~B has three choices open to him. He can (1) point his car resolutely 
at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane 
~A; (2) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes; 
or (3) alternately accelerate and decelerate, thus keeping the 
first driver guessing as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating 
sport of the whole affair.   The really remarkable thing to 
me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down 
and permit the invading car free access. Whether or not this is done 
out of enlightened self-preservation, I don't know. But it is done, 
consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed. #@#

This 
could never happen in my native Chicago. There such soggy acquiesence 
would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood. In 
Chicago, the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor 
in an effort to force the other car back. Failing this, he would pull 
alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.

This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways, however, 
does an injustice to Southern California drivers. At the risk 
of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company, I would 
like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype. After three months 
of research, I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are 
considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've 
ever encountered.   During one recent day of driving about Los 
Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers 
stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible 
side street. 

_MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17._ An out-of-town writer came up to Paul 
Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball 
club would be improved this year.   Now Richards, of course, is 
known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go. He can often make the 
complex ridiculously simple, and vice versa. This happened to be 
vice versa, but even so, the answer 
was a masterpiece.   "It's a whole lot easier", he said, 
"to increase the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the 
population of New York city". And with that he walked off to give 
instruction to a rookie pitcher.   "That is undoubtedly a hell 
of a quote", said the writer, scratching his head. "Now, if I 
can just figure out what he's talking about, I'll use it". 

#TWO 
SPOTS OPEN#

This was just Richard's way of saying that last 
year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open. 
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down, so that this spring just two 
spots, left and right field, are really up for grabs.   It should 
be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots 
that were open last year, but so far it hasn't worked that way.

This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this 
year is an interesting one. You'd never guess it from the way they've 
played so far this spring, but there remains a feeling among some 
around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the 
pennant in 1961.   Obviously, if this club is going to move from 
second to first in the American League, it will have to show improvement 
someplace. Where can that improvement possibly come from?

You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than 
it did last year. 

#ROBBY COULD BE BETTER#

Brooks Robinson is great, 
and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he 
did in 1960. You can't expect it, though. Robby's performance last 
year was tremendous.   It's the same with Ron Hansen and 
jim Gentile. If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no 
complaint. They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.

Hansen will be getting a late spring training start, which might 
very well set him back. He got off to an exceptional start last season, 
and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.

There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching 
to him last year. They don't expect to stop him, just slow him 
down some with the bat. He'll still be a top player, they concede, 
because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him. But 
they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production. 

#BREEDING 
MIGHT MOVE UP#

Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs. 
Don't ask him more.   I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move 
up a notch. But even so, he had a good year in 1960 and won't do 
too much better.   So, all in all, the infield can't be expected 
to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second 
to first.   And the pitching will also have trouble doing better. 
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and 
experience last season.   Where, then, can we look for improvement?

"From Triandos, Brandt and Walker", answers Richards. 
"They're the ones we can expect to do better".   The 
man is right, and at this time, indications are that these three are 
ready for better seasons.   Triandos hasn't proved it yet, but 
he says he's convinced his thumb is all right. He jammed it this 
spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old injury hasn't bothered 
him. If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years, 
the club will have to be better off offensively.   I'm still 
not convinced, though, I'll have to see more of him before predicting 
that big year for him. Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House 
who will be within calling distance in the minors, make up better second 
line catching than the Birds had all last year, but Gus is still 
that big man you need when you start talking pennant.   To me, 
Brandt 
looks as though he could be in for a fine year. He hasn't played 
too much, because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting 
practice. He's hitting the ball hard, in the batting cage, and 
his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.   When 
he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team which was supposed to win 
the National League pennant, and he was joining what seemed to be 
a second division American League club. He was down, hard to talk 
to, 
and far too nonchalant on the field. As of now, that all seems behind 
him. He's been entirely different all spring.   And Walker 
looks stronger, seems to be throwing better than he did last year. Let 
him bounce back, and he could really set up the staff.   So, 
if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos and Walker will have 
to do it.   So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't 
seem capable of carrying the load.   Of course, this isn't 
taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York 
city, but it's the way things look from here at this point.

Is the mother of an "autistic" child at fault? (The "autistic" 
child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self. 
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects- 
and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people.) Did his 
mother make him this way?   Some people believe she did.

We think differently. We believe that autism, like so many other conditions 
of defect and deviation, is to a large extent inborn. A mother 
can help a child adapt to his difficulties.   Sometimes she 
can- to a large extent- help him overcome them. But we don't think 
she creates them. We don't think she can make her child defective, 
emotionally disturbed or autistic.   The mother of a difficult 
child can do a great deal to help her own child and often, by sharing 
her experiences, she can help other mothers with the same problem. 
Since little is known about autism, and almost nothing has been written 
for the layman, we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments.
