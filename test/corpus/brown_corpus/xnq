stands on the margins of modernity for one reason alone- because he 
wrote <Utopia>. And the evidence that he does, indeed, stand there 
derives quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual 
readers have responded to that book for the past century or so. 
Only one other contemporary of More's evokes so immediate and direct 
a response, and only one other contemporary work- Niccolo Machiavelli 
and <The Prince>. Can we discover what it is in <Utopia> 
that has evoked this response? Remember that in seeking the modern 
in <Utopia> we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the Renaissance 
there; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing 
on the same inconceivable 
scale the relative importance of the medieval, the 
Renaissance, and the modern. The medieval was the most important 
to Chambers because he sought to place Thomas More, the author of 
<Utopia>, in some intelligible relation with St& Thomas More, 
the martyr. To others whose concern it is to penetrate the significance 
of Christian Humanism, the Renaissance elements are of primary 
concern. But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation; we want 
to know why that book has kept on selling the way it has; we want 
to know what is perennially new about <Utopia>.   What is new 
about it? To that question the answer is simple; it can be made 
in two words, Utopian communism. But it is an answer which opens the 
door wide to an onrush of objections and denials. Surely there is nothing 
new about communism. We find it in Plato's <republic>, and 
in <Utopia> More acknowledges his debt to that book. We find it 
in that "common way of life **h pleasing to Christ and **h still in 
use among the truest societies of Christians", that is, the better 
monasteries which made it easier to convert the Utopians to 
Christianity. 
We find it in the later Stoic conception of man's natural condition 
which included the community of all possessions. This conception 
was taken up by the early Church Fathers and by canon lawyers and 
theologians in the Middle Ages; and More was far too well read not 
to have come across it in one or several of the forms thus given it.

But although the idea of communism is very old even in More's 
day and did not spring full-clad from his imagination in 1515, it 
is not communism as such that we are concerned with. We are concerned 
not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus: 
Platonic, Stoic, early Christian, monastic, canonist or theological 
communism; we are concerned with Utopian communism- that is, simply 
communism as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth of Utopia, 
as More conceived it. Perhaps one way to sharpen our sense of the modernity 
of Utopian communism is to contrast it with the principal earlier 
types of communistic theory. We will achieve a more vivid sense 
of what it is by realizing what it is not.   In Plato's <Republic> 
communism is- to speak anachronistically- a communism of Janissaries. 
Its function is to separate from the base ruled mass, among 
whom private ownership prevails, the governing warrior elite. Moreover, 
it is too readily forgotten that in the <Republic> what 
gave 
the initial impetus to Plato's excursus into the construction of an 
imaginary commonwealth with its ruling-class communism of goods, wives, 
and children, was his quest for a canon for the proper ordering of 
the individual human psyche; and it is to this problem that the <Republic> 
ultimately returns. In More's <Utopia> communism is not 
a means of separating out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass. Utopian 
communism applies to all Utopians. And in the economy of the 
book it is not peripheral but central. The concern of <Utopia> is 
with the <optimo reipublicae statu>, the best ordering of a civil society; 
and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism 
provides the institutional array indispensible to that best ordering.

To derive Utopian communism from the Jerusalem Christian community 
of the apostolic age or from its medieval successors-in-spirit, 
the monastic communities, is with an appropriate shift of adjectives, 
misleading in the same way as to derive it from Plato's <Republic>: 
in the <Republic> we have to do with an elite of physical 
and intellectual athletes, in the apostolic and monastic communities with 
an elite of spiritual and religious athletes. The apostolic community 
was literally an elite: chosen by Christ himself. And the monastic 
communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers selected only 
after a novitiate which would test their religious aptitude for monastic 
rigors, their spiritual athleticism.   Finally, the conception 
of the <natural> community of all possessions which originated 
with the Stoics was firmly fixed in a tradition by More's time, although 
it was not accepted by all the theologian-philosophers of the 
Middle Ages. In that tradition communism lay a safe distance back in 
the age of innocence before the Fall of Man. It did not serve to 
contrast the existing order of society with a possible alternative order, 
because the age of innocence was not a possible alternative once man 
had sinned. The actual function of patristic-civilian-canonist-scholastic 
communism was adequately set forth by St& Gregory almost a 
millenium before More wrote <Utopia>.   "The soil is common 
to all men **h. When we give the necessities of life to the poor, 
we restore to them what is already theirs. We should think of it more 
as an act of justice than compassion".   Because community not 
severalty of property is the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely 
unalterable right to what is his. Indeed, of all that is his every 
man is by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligated 
to regard himself as a custodian. He is a trustee for the common good, 
however feeble the safeguards which the positive or municipal law of 
property provides against his misuse of that share of the common fund, 
wisely or unwisely, entrusted to his keeping. In contrast to this 
Stoic-patristic view, <Utopia> implies that the nature of man is such 
that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiencies of 
municipal law is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness 
in a sieve. The Utopians brace conscience with legal sanctions. In 
a properly ordered society the massive force of public law performs the 
function which in natural law theory ineptly is left altogether to 
a small voice so often still.   In all the respects just 
indicated 
Utopian communism differs from previous conceptions in which community 
of possessions and living plays a role. Neither from one of these 
conceptions nor from a combination of them can it be deduced. We do 
not deny originality to the <Agamemnon> because Aeschylus found the 
tales of the house of Atreus among the folk lore of the Greeks. In 
a like sense whatever bits or shreds of previous conceptions one may 
find in it, Utopian communism remains, as an integral whole, original- 
a new thing. It is not merely a new thing; it is one of the very 
few new things in <Utopia>; most of the rest is medieval or humanist 
or part of an old tradition of social criticism. But to say that 
at a moment in history something is <new> is not necessarily to say 
that it is modern; and for this statement the best evidence comes 
within the five years following the publication of <Utopia>, when 
Martin Luther elaborates a new perception of the nature of the Divine's 
encounter with man. New, indeed, is Luther's perception, but 
not modern, as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible 
to modern students what Luther was getting at.   Although Utopian 
communism is both new in 1516 and also modern, it is not modern communism 
or even modern socialism, as they exist or have ever existed in 
theory or in practice. Consider the features of Utopian communism: 
generous public provision for the infirm; democratic and secret elections 
of all officers including priests, meals taken publicly in common 
refectories; a common habit or uniform prescribed for all citizens; 
even houses changed once a decade; six hours of manual labor 
a day for all but a handful of magistrates and scholars, and careful measures 
to prevent anyone from shirking; no private property, no money; 
no sort of pricing at all for any goods or services, and therefore 
no market in the economic sense of the term. Whatever the merits of 
its intent, Utopian communism is far too naive, far too crude, to suit 
any modern socialist or communist. It is not the details of Utopian 
communism that make <Utopia> modern, it is the spirit, the attitude 
of mind that informs those details. What that spirit and attitude 
were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts 
with the communist tradition with the longest continuous history, the 
one which reached Christianity by the way of Stoicism through the 
Church Fathers of Late Antiquity.

During the Dorr trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings 
and heralded Dorr as a martyr to the principles of the Declaration 
of Independence. During the Brown trial, however, the state's 
most powerful Democratic newspaper, the Providence <Daily Post>, 
stated that Brown was a murderer, a man of blood, and that he and 
his associates, with the assistance of Republicans and Abolitionists, 
had plotted not only the liberation of the slaves but also the overthrow 
of state and federal governments. The Providence <Daily Journal> 
answered the <Daily Post> by stating that the raid of John 
Brown was characteristic of Democratic acts of violence and that "He 
was acting in direct opposition to the Republican Party, who proclaim 
as one of their cardinal principles that they do not interfere 
with slavery in the states". The two major newspapers in Providence 
continued, throughout the crisis, to accuse each other of misrepresenting 
the facts and attempting to falsify history.   While the 
<Daily Post> continued to accuse Republicans and the <Daily Journal> 
continued to accuse Democrats, the Woonsocket <Patriot> complained 
that the Virginia authorities showed indecent and cowardly 
haste to condemn Brown and his men. Editor Foss stated, "Of their 
guilt **h there can be no doubt **h but they are entitled to sufficient 
time to prepare for trial, and **h a fair trial". The Providence 
<Daily Post> thought that there were probably good reasons for 
the haste in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing 
gained by a delay would be calmer feelings. The Providence <Daily 
Journal> stated that although the guilt of Brown was evident, the 
South must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace.

On October 31, 1859, John Brown was found guilty of treason 
against the state of Virginia, inciting slave rebellion, and murder. 
For these crimes he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday, 
December 2, 1859. Upon receiving the news, Northern writers, editors, 
and clergymen heaped accusations of murder on the Southern states, 
particularly Virginia.   Although Rhode Islanders were preparing 
for the state elections, they watched John Brown's trial with 
extreme interest. On Wednesday morning, November 2, 1859, the Providence 
<Daily Journal> stated that although Brown justly deserved 
the extreme penalty, no man, however criminal, ought to suffer the penalty 
without a fairer trial. The editor's main criticism of the trial 
was the haste with which it was conducted. The readers of the Providence 
<Daily Post>, however, learned that it was generally conceded 
that "Old Brown" had a fair trial. Concerning the sentence 
the editor asked, "What else can Virginia do than to hang the men 
who have 
defied her laws, organized treason, and butchered her citizens".

In the eastern section of the state the newspapers' reaction 
to Brown's trial and sentence were basically identical. J& 
Wheaton Smith, editor of the Warren <Telegraph> stated that "the 
ends of justice must be satisfied, a solitary example must be set, 
in order that all those misnamed philantropists [<sic>], who, actuated 
by a blind zeal, dare to instigate riot, treason, and murder, may 
heed it and shape their future course accordingly". The editor of 
the Newport <Advertiser> could discover no evidence of extenuating 
circumstances in the Brown trial which would warrant making an exception 
to the infliction of capital punishment.   In direct contrast 
to the other Rhode Island editors, Samuel S& Foss of the Woonsocket 
<Patriot> outwardly condemned the trial as being completely 
unfair. Concerning the sentence, Foss wrote, "If it be possible 
**h that mercy shall override vengeance **h and that John Brown's 
sentence shall be commuted to imprisonment, it would be well- well 
for the country **h and for Virginia".   Despite the excitement
