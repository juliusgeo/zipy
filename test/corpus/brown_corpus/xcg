tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish 
to say something meaningful to her, something her mother would wish 
said. For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't 
have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message 
to Garcia. But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been 
through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young 
female- six girls sprawled on one bed, drinking Cokes and giggling- 
she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.   "How 
do you know you love somebody enough to get married"? she asked.

It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have 
ever asked: How can you be sure?   "Aren't you sure"? 
I asked, looking at her searchingly. I wanted to grab her by the 
arm and beg her to wait, to consider, to know for certain because life 
is so long and marriage is so important. But if she were just having 
a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten 
her out of a really good marriage. Besides, in all honesty, I don't 
know how you can be sure. I don't know any secret recipe for certainty. 
In the fevered, intoxicating, breathless state of being in love 
the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships 
are sometimes obscured. I knew of but one test and I threw it 
out to her for what it was worth.   "Does he ever bore you"? 
I asked.   "Bore me"? she was shocked. Oh, no-o! Why, 
he's so darling and **h"   "I mean", I went on ruthlessly, 
"when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders 
of love, is he interesting? Does he care about things that matter 
to you? Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island 
for years and years and still find him fascinating?   Because, 
honey, I thought silently, there are plenty of desert islands in 
every marriage- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded, together. 
And if you bore each other then, heaven help you.   She came 
back the other day to reassure me. She has studied and observed and 
she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.

She asked if I had other advice and, heady with success, 
I rushed it in, I hope not too late. Be friends with your mother-in-law. 
Jokes, cartoons and cynics to the contrary, mothers-in-law make 
good friends.

I do not know Dr& Wilson Sneed well. But I was deeply moved 
by his letter of resignation as rector of St& Luke's Church 
in Atlanta. It was the cry of not just one heart; it spoke for many 
in the clergy, I suspect. The pulpit is a lonely place. Who stops 
to think of that?   Imagine the searching and the prayer that 
lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service 
to this majestic church. "Such a church needs vigor and vitality 
in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments", 
he told his members.   A minister should not stay "beyond the 
time that his leadership should benefit" his church, he wrote, "**h 
for he becomes ordinary **h". @ ##

And so the young minister 
resigned, to go and study and pray, having never passed a day, he 
told his parishioners, when "I did not gain from you far more than 
I ever gave to you".   His very honest act called up the recent 
talk I had with another minister, a modest Methodist, who said: 
"I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love 
and comfort to other men, and I would have it no other way: and 
it is unworthy to think of self. But oh, how I do sometimes need just 
a moment of rest, and peace, in myself".   A man who gives 
himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself 
a life of giving. He does not expect to get great riches or he would 
not have chosen to answer the call to preach. The good ones are not 
motivated to seek vainly, nor are they disposed to covet comfort, or they 
would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity. 
Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards. ##

Yet we who 
lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation 
of the infinite through him- we who readily accept his sacrifice 
as our due, we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is 
in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul. We press 
him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions 
with his word, and God's. We do not defeat the good ones 
with this cruelty, but we add to their burden, while expecting them 
to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance 
and a few bucks a week, American cash. If we break the minister 
to our bit, we are buying back our own sins. If he won't break, we 
add to the stress he bears.   And a minister of all men is most 
conscious that he is mere man- prone to the stresses that earthly 
humanity is heir to. We expect him to be noble, and to make us so- 
yet he knows, and tries to tell us, how very humble man must be.

We expect bestowal of God's love through him. But how little love 
we give him. The church truly is not a rest home for saints, but a 
hospital for sinners. Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency 
room to receive first aid, and we leave unmindful that the man who 
ministered to us is a human being who suffers, too.

Mr& Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each 
summer at Loon Lake. The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around 
it only emphasized the pleasure.   The evening was not always 
spent in the same way. This year, on a night cool with the front of September 
moving in, but with plenty of summer still about, the Podgers 
were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod. The little cottage 
was bursting with people of all ages.   In the midst of it all, 
Mr& Podger came out on the Pod porch, alone. He had that day 
attended a country auction, and he had come back with a prize. 
The prize was an old-fashioned, woven cloth hammock, complete with cross-top 
pillow, fringed side pieces, and hooks for hanging. Mrs& Podger 
had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for 
it, and there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night breeze 
rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.   Mr& 
Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and forth in one or two 
slow, rhythmic motions, and then swung his feet up into it. He closed 
his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly 
over him. Suddenly one young voice rose above the others. "But", 
it said, "do you always <know> when you're happy"? 
The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound, but the question 
stayed in Mr& Podger's mind. Here, in the cool, autumn-touched 
evening, Mr& Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly 
contented and at peace. #@#

It had begun with the blue jay 
feather. Walking along the lake before breakfast, Mr& Podger had 
seen the feather, and the bird that had lost it in flight. The winging 
spread of blue had gone on, calling harshly, into the wood. The 
small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet. All 
day long Mr& Podger, who was a straw-hat man in the summer, had 
worn 
the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield. Would a blue 
feather in a man's hat make him happy all day? Hardly. But it 
was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning 
sunshine, linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by 
the lake.   Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he had 
walked to it. And there, on the way, had been the box turtle, that 
slow, self-contained, world-ignoring relic of pre-history, bent, for 
reasons best known to itself, on crossing the road. It was doing very 
well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing its way with commendable 
singleness of purpose when Mr& Podger saw hazard approaching 
in the shape of a flashy little sports car. Would the driver see 
the turtle? Would he take pains to avoid it?   Mr& Podger 
took no chances. Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with 
it, Mr& Podger stepped into the road, lifted the surprised turtle 
and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking 
suddenness.   The turtle immediately withdrew into its private 
council room to study the phenomenon. But Mr& Podger and the 
driver of the sports car waved at each other. Here in the cool darkness 
Mr& Podger could still feel the warmth of midday, could still 
see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road, could still see the 
friendly grin on the young, sun-browned face as the driver looked back 
over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight.

Where was the driver now? What was he doing? And the turtle? 
Mr& Podger smiled. For a few brief minutes they had all been 
part of one little drama. The three would never meet again, but for 
some reason or other Mr& Podger was sure he would always remember 
the incident.   Then there had been the auction itself. Mr& 
Podger heard again, at will, the voice of the auctioneer, the voices 
of the bidders, and finally the small boy who had been so interested 
in Mr& Podger's hammock purchase.   "I like them things, 
too", he had said. "We got one at home. You know what? If 
you're lyin' out in the hammock at night, and it gets kinda cool- 
you know- you just take these sides with the fringe on- see- 
and wrap 'em right over you. I do it, lots o' times- I like to 
lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when it's all quiet. **h The 
wind moves it a little bit- you know **h". #@#

Mr& Podger 
had 
thanked him gravely, and now he made use of the advice. As he pulled 
the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon, Mr& Podger 
saw that thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped that 
the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped quiet.   Alacrity, 
the Podger cat, came by the hammock, rubbed her back briefly 
against it, and then, sure of a welcome, hopped up. She remarked that 
she found the night wind a little chilly, and Mr& Podger took her 
inside the fringe. Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree 
crickets, rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod.   Mr& 
Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen 
door opened and Pam burst out. "Dad"! she said. "It's 
getting so chilly we've lighted a fire, and we're going to tell 
a round robin story- a nice, scary one. We need you to start it. Why 
are you out here all by yourself? Aren't you happy"?

Mr& Podger opened his cocoon and emerged, tucking Alacrity under 
his arm to bring her in by the fire. "Of course I am", he said. 
"Never happier in my life. I just came out here to know it". 

_DALLAS_ As the South begins another school year, national and even 
world 
attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial 
equality in the public schools.   Desegregation is beginning in 
two more important Southern cities- Dallas and Atlanta. In each 
city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public 
opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.

These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully. 
The programs do not take sides on the issue itself. They point 
out simply that "it is the law of the land".   The two 
cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up 
as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes 
of desegregation. Even better, they have the examples of Nashville 
and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs. 
In each case there was an initial act of violence. In Nashville, a 
school was dynamited. In Houston, there were a few incidents of friction 
between whites and Negroes, none of which were serious.   In 
each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government 
halted the threats of more serious incidents.   The Nashville 
plan, incidentally, has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable
