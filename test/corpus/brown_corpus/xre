S& Navy type aircraft.   If it were the enemy, tactically 
his position was correct. Japanese aircraft were strong on maneuverability, 
American on speed and firepower. His present maximum altitude, 
up against the overcast, gave him the opportunity to exploit his 
advantages. But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy, if it was 
the enemy, and he hadn't been spotted already. But the closing aircraft 
showed no sign of deviating from their original course.   In 
seconds, Greg made his decision.   He pushed the radio button. 
"Sweeney Blue, hit the deck. Lots of throttle. Todman, you take 
the one on the left. I'll take the middle. Belton, the one on the 
right. If **h <if> they're Japs. Let's make sure first". 
Greg had the stick forward and the throttle up before he heard the two 
"Rogers".   The planes, light with most of the gas burned 
out, responded beautifully. Greg's airspeed indicator was over 350 
when he leveled off just above the trees. The opposing aircraft continued 
to come on. They appeared to be the enemy. Greg wished the Air 
Corps had continued to camouflage planes. There was, of course, no 
way for the other planes to get by them. It was a box. But they could 
turn and escape to the east.   Greg pushed the radio button again. 
"Todman, drop your second element back. If any of us miss, they 
can pick up the pieces. Now let's make sure they're Japs".

Even as he said it, Greg knew they had found the enemy. The 
shapes were unmistakable and the Rising Suns were showing up, slightly 
brighter pinpoints in the gray gloom.   Greg slapped his hand 
across the switches that turned on the guns and gun camera and gun sight. 
The circle with the dot in the center showed up yellow on the reflector 
glass in front of him. His hands shook. "Arm your guns, Sweeneys".

"They're Japs. They're Japs", came a high-pitched 
voice.   "Greg to Sweeney Blue. One pass only. 
No turns. You'll bust your ass in this canyon. That's an order".

He moved the flights over against one wall. It gave them 
all a chance to make a high-speed climbing turn attack and a break-away 
that would not take them into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery. 
If the turn was too tight, a barrel roll would bring them out. 
A hell of an altitude for a barrel roll, but it could be done.

Greg slammed his throttle to the fire wall and rammed up the ~RPM, 
and the engine responded as if it had been waiting. The clearly 
identifiable enemy continued on as if no one else were around. "They 
haven't seen us", Greg yelled to himself over the engine noise. 
"They haven't seen us". He hit the radio button. "Now, Sweeneys, 
now. Let's take 'em home".   He hauled back on the 
stick and felt his cheeks sag. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched 
his wingman move out a bit and shoot up with him. Perfect, he thought.

With the rapid rate of closure, the approach from below, 
the side, and ahead, there would be only a moment when damage could 
be done. Just like shooting at a duck while performing a half-gainer 
from a diving board.   He tightened his turn. His nose up. It 
was going to be dangerous. Eight aircraft in this small box. Please, 
dear God, make my pilots good, he prayed.   He took a lead on 
the enemy, using a distance of five of the radii in his circular sight 
and then added another. The enemy did not veer. It did not seem possible 
that they hadn't been spotted. Blind fools.   Now!

Greg's fingers closed on the stick trigger. The plane rumbled 
and slowed. Six red lines etched their way into the gray and vanished. 
As if drawn by a wire the enemy flew into them. Greg tightened his 
turn until the plane shuddered. Luck was with him. His burst held 
for a second on the engine section of the plane. The Jap's propeller 
flew off in pieces. A large piece of engine cowling vanished. It 
was all Greg had time to see. His maneuvering for the shot had placed 
him near the overcast, almost inverted and heading up into the clouds. 
His speed was dropping rapidly. If he spun out now, he would join 
his opponent on the ground.   Wingman, stay clear, he prayed. He 
pushed stick and rudder and entered the overcast on his back. He fought 
the panic of vertigo. He had no idea which was up and which was 
down. He held the controls where they had been. Sweat popped out over 
him and he felt the slick between his palm and the stick grip. His 
air speed dropped until he thought he would spin out.

Over the rattling of fenders, humming of tires and chattering 
of gears there was a charming melody of whispers and tiny giggles. Cool 
air moving slowly through the open or smashed-out side windows hinted 
of blooming roadside vegetation, and occasionally a faint fragrance 
of perfume swirled from the back seat.   "Moriarty", my driver 
suddenly exclaimed with something so definite, so final in his tone 
I 
once more repeated the absurdity, mustering all my latent powers of 
hypocrisy to sound convinced.   We were coming to an intersection, 
turning right, chuffing to a stop.   Forced to realize that 
this was the end of a very short line I scanned a road marker and discovered 
what the end of a slightly longer line would be for the old 
Mexican: Moriarty, New Mexico.   "Gracias. Adios", I 
said, exhausting my Spanish vocabulary on my host and exchanging one 
of a scarcely-tapped store of smiles with my host's daughters. I 
waved with discretion and moderation to the vague golden faces fading 
through rising dust and the distortions of the back window glass. Then 
I saw the father's head slightly turn; gauche rainbow shapes replaced 
the poignant ovals of gold. ##

Autos whizzed past. White-shirted 
and conservatively-cravated drivers stared conspicuously toward 
the eastern horizon and past my supplicating and accusing gaze.

Suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled, and, thumbing hopefully, 
I saw emergent in windshield flash: red lips, streaming silk 
of blonde hair and- ah, trembling confusion of hope, apprehension, 
despair- the leering face of old Herry.   "Mor-ee-air-teeeee", 
he shrieked, his white teeth grossly counterpointing those of 
the glittering blonde.   Over the rapidly-diminishing outline of 
a jump seat piled high with luggage Herry's black brushcut was just 
discernible, near, or enviably near that spot where- hidden- more 
delicately-textured, most beautifully tinted hair must still be streaming 
back in cool, oh cool wind sweetly perfumed with sagebrush and yucca 
flowers and engine fumes.   Damn his luck. I would have foregone 
my romantic chances rather than leave a friend sweltering and dusty 
and- Well, at least I wouldn't have shouted back a taunt.

Still nursing anger I listlessly thumbed a car that was slowly 
approaching, its pre-war chrome nearly blinding me. It was stopping.

Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag, I heard: "Sahjunt 
Yoorick, meet Mrs& Major J& A& Roebuck". The 
voice 
was that of Johnson, tail gunner off another crew.   Squeezing 
a look between Johnson's fat jowls and the car frame a handsome 
and still darkhaired lady inquired "Y'all drahve"?   I 
nodded.   "Onleh one thiihng", Mrs& Roebuck continued. 
"Ahm goin nawth t'jawn mah husbun in Sante Fe, an y'all maht 
prefuh the suhthuhn rewt. But Corporal Johnson has alreadeh said it 
didn make no diffrunce t'hi-im".   I said that it didn't 
make any difference to me either, as far as I knew.   How far 
I knew will shortly become apparent. Let me pass over the trip to Sante 
Fe with something of the same speed which made Mrs& Roebuck 
"wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit" (35 m&p&h&) "is still 
in ee-faket".   I let up on the accelerator, only to gradually 
reach again the 60 m&p&h& which would, I hoped, overhaul Herry 
and the blonde, and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had 
something more important to catch than had I, Mrs& Major Roebuck 
settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles 
she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs& Somebody 
in Sante Fe.   When Johnson ejaculated "Howsabout my 
buying us all a nice cold Co-cola, Ma'am"? Mrs& Roebuck smilingly 
declined and began suddenly to go on about her son, who was "onleh 
a little younguh than you bawhs".   Johnson never would 
have believed she had a son that age. Mrs& Roebuck thought Johnson 
was a "sweet bawh t'lah lahk thet", but her Herman was getting 
to be a man, there was no getting around it. "Just befoh he left 
foh his academeh we wuh hevin dack-rihs on the vuhranduh, Major Roebuck 
an Ah, an Huhmun says 'May Ah hev one <too>'? just as 
p'lite an- an cohnfidunt, an Ah says 'Uh coahse you cain't', 
but he says 'Whah nawt, you ah hevin one'? an Ah coudn ansuh 
him an so Ah said 'Aw right, Ah gay-ess, an his fathuh didn uttuh 
one wohd an aftuh Huhmun was gone, the majuh laughed an tole me 
thet he an the bawh had been hevin an occasional drink t'gethuh f'ovuh 
a yeah, onleh an occasional one, but just the same it was behahn 
mah back, an Ah doan think <thet's> nahce at all, d'<you>"?

"No, I don't", Johnson said. "I'm a good Baptist, 
and drinking **h" ##

Mrs& Roebuck very kindly let me drive 
through Sante Fe to a road which would, she said, lead us to Taos 
and then Raton and "eventshahleh" out of New Mexico. How lightly 
her "eventshah-leh" passed into the crannies where I was storing 
dialect material for some vaguely dreamed opus, and how the word 
would echo. And re-echo.   Hardly had Mrs& Roebuck driven 
off when a rusty pick-up truck, father or grandfather of Senor 
"Moriarty's" Ford sedan, came screeching to a dust-swirling stop, 
and a brown face appeared, its nose threatened by shards of what 
had once been the side window.   "Get in, buddies. Get in". 
The straight, black hair flopped in a vigorous nod, the slender nose 
plunged toward glass teeth and drew safely back.   Johnson unwired 
the right hand door, whose window was, like the left one, merely loosely-taped 
fragments of glass, and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow 
seat made still more narrow by three cases of beer.   "In 
back, buddy", the driver said to me.   Quickly but carefully 
lowering my duffel bag over the low side-rack, I stepped on the running 
board; it flopped down, sprang back up and gouged my shin. The truck 
was hurtling forward. I seized the rack and made a western-style 
flying-mount just in time, one of my knees mercifully landing on my duffel 
bag- and merely wrecking my camera, I was to discover later- 
my other knee landing on the slivery truck floor boards and- but this 
is no medical report.   I was again in motion and at a speed 
which belied the truck's similarity to Senor ~X's Ford turtle. 
Maybe I would beat old Herry to Siberia after all. Whatever satisfaction 
that might offer.   Something pulled my leg.   I 
drew back, drawing back my foot for a kick. But it was only Johnson 
reaching around the wire chicken fencing, which half covered the truck 
cab's glassless rear window. The way his red rubber lips were stretched 
across his pearly little teeth I though he was only having a 
little joke, but, no, he wanted me to bend down from the roar of wind 
so he could roar something into my ear.   "Wanna beer"?

"Hell, yes", I roared back between dusty lips. <Did> I 
want a beer? Did an anteater want ants?   "Bueno, amigo. 
Gracias", I hollered, my first long swallow filling me with confidence 
and immediately doubling the size of my Spanish vocabulary.

At once my ears were drowned by a flow of what I took to be Spanish, 
but- the driver's white teeth flashing at me, the road wildly 
veering beyond his glistening hair, beyond his gesticulating bottle- 
it could have 
been the purest Oxford English I was half hearing; I 
wouldn't have known the difference.   Johnson was trying to 
grab the wheel, though the swerve of the truck was throwing him away from
