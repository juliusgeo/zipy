and the key, emotionally relevant issues ("underlying problem") 
which are, often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough, reactivated 
by the crisis situation, and hence once again amenable to resolution. 
Though there is obviously nothing new about these techniques, they 
do challenge the worker's skill to articulate them precisely on the 
spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessments. 
Then, too, the utmost clinical flexibility is necessary in judiciously 
combining carefully timed family-oriented home visits, single and group 
office interviews, and appropriate telephone follow-up calls, if 
the worker is to be genuinely accessible and if the predicted unhealthy 
outcome is to be actually averted in accordance with the principles 
of preventive intervention. In addition, in many cases, a variety of 
concrete social resources- homemaker, day care, medical and financial 
aid- must be reasonably available for the reality support needed to 
bolster the family in its individual and collective coping and integrative 
efforts. At certain critical stages, and only for sound diagnostic 
reasons, it may be important to accompany family members in their use 
of these resources if their problem-solving behavior is to be constructive 
rather than defeating. While expensive in time and involving 
a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker (in terms of his 
willingness to leave the sanctity of his office and enter actively into 
the client's life), techniques of accompaniment were found to be of 
tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objectives. 
Finally, whatever the techniques used, a twin goal is common to all 
preventive casework service: to cushion or reduce the force of the 
stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family 
members to mobilize and use their ego capacities.   Having outlined 
an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework, we 
now address ourselves to our final question: What place should brief, 
crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in our total spectrum of 
services? We should first recognize our tendency to develop a hierarchy 
of values, locating brief treatment at the bottom and long-term 
intensive service at the top, instead of seeing the services as part 
of a continuum, each important in its own right. This problem is perhaps 
as old as social casework itself. Almost three decades ago Bertha 
Reynolds undertook a study of short-contact interviewing because of 
her conviction that short-term casework had an important but neglected 
place in our network of social services. Her conclusion has been borne 
out in the experience of many practitioners: "**h short-contact 
interviewing is neither a truncated nor a telescoped experience but 
is of the same essential quality as the so-called intensive case work". 
Thus, 
casework involving a limited number of interviews is still to be 
regarded in terms of the quality of service rendered rather than of the 
quantity of time expended.   That we are experiencing an upsurge 
of interest in the many formulations and preventive adaptations of 
brief treatment in social casework is evident from even a small sampling 
of current literature. Especially noteworthy is Levinger's finding 
that the length of treatment per se is not a reliable indicator of 
successful outcome. According to a number of studies, the important 
predictors are the nature and management of the client's anxiety as 
well as the accessibility of the helping person. For example, the level 
of improvement noted in a recent experiment with a short course of 
immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problems compared favorably 
with the results reported by typical child guidance clinics where 
the hours spent in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the 
number of hours devoted to actual treatment interviews in the experimental 
project. Of startling significance, too, is the assertion that 
it was possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition 
rate as compared with a rate of 59 percent reported for a comparable 
group of families who were receiving help in traditionally operated 
child guidance services. These reports refer to a level of secondary 
prevention in a child guidance clinic approached by the customary route 
of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people. 
Similarities to the approach which I have described are evident in 
the prompt establishment of a helping relationship, quick appraisal of 
key issues, and the immediate mobilization of treatment plans as the 
essential dynamics in helping to further the ego's coping efforts in 
dealing with the interplay of inner and outer stresses. While there 
are many different possibilities for the timing of casework intervention, 
the experiments recently reported from a variety of traditional settings 
all point up the importance of an <immediate> response to the client's 
initial need for help. In some programs, treatment is concentrated 
over a short period of time, while in others, after the initial 
contact is established, flexible spacing of interviews has been experimentally 
used with apparent success. Willingness to take the risk of 
early and direct interpretation (with the proviso that if the interpretation 
is too threatening, the worker can withdraw) is another prominent 
feature in these efforts. My aim in mentioning this factor obviously 
is not to give license to "wild therapy" but rather to encourage 
us to use the time-honored clinical casework skills we already possess, 
and to use them with greater confidence, precision, and professional 
pride.   Though there is obviously great need for continued 
experimentation with various types of short-term intervention to further 
efforts in developing an operational definition of prevention at 
the secondary- or perhaps, in some instances, primary- level, the 
place of short-term intervention has already been documented by a number 
of investigators in a wide variety of settings. Woodward, for example, 
has emphasized the "need for a broad spectrum of services, including 
very brief services in connection with critical situations". Ideally, 
brief treatment should be arrived at as a treatment of choice 
rather 
than as a treatment of chance. Moreover, the shortage of treatment 
resources and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower 
force us to innovate additional refinements of preventive intervention 
techniques to make services more widely available- and on a 
more effective basis to more people. Further research in the meaning 
of crises as experienced by the consumers of traditional social casework 
services- including attempts to develop a typology of family structures, 
crisis problems, reaction mechanisms, and differential treatment 
approaches- and the establishment of new experimental programs are 
imperative social needs which should command the best efforts of caseworkers 
in collaboration with community planners.   our literature 
is already replete with a fantastic number of suggestions for preventive 
agency programming ranging from the immediately practical to the 
globally utopian. Probably, in the immediate future, we will have to 
settle for middle-range efforts that fall short of utopian models. Increased 
experimentation with multipurpose agencies, especially those 
that combine afresh the traditional functions of family and child welfare 
services, holds rich promise for the future. For example, child welfare 
experience abounds with cases in which the parental request for 
substitute care is precipitated by a crisis event which is meaningfully 
linked with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationships. 
_SENTIMENT:_ Tension management and communication of sentiment 
are the processes involved in the functioning of the element of sentiment 
or feeling. One of the devices for tension management is preferential 
mating. The preferential mating of this particular population 
has been analyzed in a separate study. The relative geographical isolation 
of the Brandywine population makes for a limited choice in mating. 
It would seem necessary that members of this population provide support 
for one another since it is not provided by the larger society. The 
supportive relations can apparently be achieved in geographical and 
social isolation. The newlyweds building homes on the same land with 
either set of parents, and the almost exclusive use of members of the 
population as sponsors for baptisms and weddings illustrate this supportive 
relationship. As Loomis remarks, "In the internal pattern 
the chief reason for interacting is to communicate liking, friendship, 
and love among those who stand in supporting relations to one another 
and corresponding negative sentiments to those who stand in antagonistic 
relations". _ACHIEVING:_ Maintenance of the <status 
quo> might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population 
today. Yet, the object of the element of achieving through the 
process of goal attaining for this population appears to have been changed 
by circumstances brought about by the war. Prior to World War 
/2, there was a higher percentage of endogamous marriages than after 
World war /2,. _NORMS:_ The norms, as elements, refer 
to "all criteria for judging the character or conduct of both individual 
and group actions in any social system". The process of evaluation 
assigns varying positive and negative priorities or values to elements. 
The elements and processes become evident in a study of mate 
selection in this population. From the evidence "it may be conjectured 
that core-core marriages are the preferred unions for core males and 
females; core-marginal marriages still belong in the category of 
permissive unions; and core-Negro marriages are proscribed for core 
members". _STATUS-ROLES:_ The element of status-roles and associated 
processes have not been sufficiently investigated for this population 
to permit any type of conjectures about them. _POWER:_ 
There is some indication from a limited number of interviews with members 
of the population that the element of power, primarily the voluntary 
influence of non-authoritative power, has been exerted on actors in 
the system, particularly in regard to mate selection. This would seem 
to vary from family to family, depending somewhat on the core or marginal 
"status" of that family. Again, size of the group may have 
some influence on the strength of group controls. _RANKING:_ Interviews 
with members of the Brandywine population were attempted in 
order 
to discover the ranking of the various families in the population. 
The large majority of the interviewees placed core families in the 
upper positions. Loomis considers ranking a product of the evaluation 
process. "The standing or rank of an actor in a given social system 
is determined by the evaluation placed upon the actor and his acts in 
accordance with the norms and standards of the system". Despite the 
increasing rate of exogamous marriages, the population has been able 
to sustain, at least to some degree, the consciousness of its intermediate 
status in society. To some extent the system can be considered 
a <Gemeinschaft> in which "social-role occupancies are determined 
by birth, by attributes such as sex or caste, which are biologically 
or socially immutable". The adherence of many in the population to 
the Indian background in their pedigree, and emphasis upon the fact 
that their ancestors had never been slaves, becomes of prime interest 
in 
determining how far these elements promote the self-image of the intermediate 
status of the group in society. _SANCTIONS:_ The negative 
sanctions applied to core-Negro marriages for core members act as 
indicators of expected adherence to group norms. However, because of 
Church laws, lately more stringently enforced, which forbid the marriage 
of cousins closely related consanguineously, a means of facilitating 
the goal of in-group relations may be that of recourse to illegitimate 
unions. A cursory survey of available material indicates a high 
rate of illegitimate births occurring to parents who have a close consanguineous 
relationship. 

#SUBSYSTEMS#

The comprehensive or master 
processes activate all or some of the elements within the social system 
and subsystems. Within the larger social system are the structural 
and functional subsystems. The structural subsystem, consisting of 
relatively stable inter-relationships among its parts, includes: _1._ 
Subgroups of various types, interconnected by relational norms. 
_2._ Roles of various types, within the larger system and within 
the subgroups **h _3._ Regulative norms governing subgroups and 
roles. _4._ Cultural values.   In the study of marriage 
patterns for this group, consanguinity produces the structural system- 
a system of affinities- which, in turn, maintains the system of 
consanguinity. Subgroups of various types have been found within this 
system. Each family line can be considered a substructure. There seems 
to be an implied cultural value attached to the fact of core status 
within the group. Additionally, the proscription of core-Negro marriages 
for core families, discussed above, would seem to act as a regulative
