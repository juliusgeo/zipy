the ego and superego. 

#GOSSON AND SIDNEY#

The second half of 
the sixteenth century in England was the setting for a violent and long 
controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature, especially 
the drama. No one suggested that the ethical effects of the art 
were irrelevant. Both sides agreed that the theater must stand a moral 
test, but they could not agree on whether the poets were a good or 
a bad influence. Both sides claimed that Plato and Aristotle supported 
their cause. Those who wanted to close the theaters, for example, 
pointed to Plato's <Republic> and those who wished to keep them 
open called on the Plato of the <Ion> to testify in their behalf.

The most famous document that comes out of this dispute is perhaps 
Sir Philip Sidney's <An Apologie for Poetrie,> published 
in 1595. Many students of literature know that classical defense. 
What is not so well known, however, and what is quite important for 
understanding the issues of this early quarrel, is the kind of attack 
on literature that Sidney was answering. For this reason, then I want 
to describe, first, two examples of the puritanical attacks: Stephen 
Gosson's <The School of Abuse,> 1579, and his later <Playes 
Confuted,> published in 1582. Second, we will see how Sidney 
answered the charges, for while Sidney's essay was not specifically 
a reply to Gosson, his arguments do support the new theater. 
According to William Ringler's study, <Stephen Gosson,> the theater 
business in London had become a thriving enterprise by 1577, and, 
in the opinion of many, a thoroughly bad business. Aroused by what 
they considered an evil influence, some members of the clergy, joined 
by city authorities, merchants, and master craftsmen, began the attack 
on the plays and the actors for what they called "the abuses of the 
art", but by 1582 some of them began to denounce the whole idea of 
acting. Although this kind of wholesale objection came at first from 
some men who were not technically Puritans, still, once the Puritans 
gained power, they climaxed the affair by passing the infamous ordinance 
of 1642 which decreed that all "public stage-plays shall cease 
and be forborne". With that act of Parliament the opponents of the 
stage won the day, and for more than two decades after that England 
had no legitimate public drama.   In the early days of this controversy 
over the theater one of the interested parties, Stephen Gosson, 
published a little tract in which he objected mildly to the abuses 
of art, rather than the art itself. But his opposition hardened and 
by 1579, in <The School of Abuse,> he was ready to banish all "players". 
He advises women to beware "of those places which in sorrows 
cheere you and beguile you in mirth". He does not really approve 
of levity and laughter, but sex is the deadly sin. He warns that 
a single glance can lead us into temptation, for "Looking eies have 
lyking hartes, and lyking hartes may burne in lust".

But it would not be very satisfactory to leave our conclusions 
at the point just reached. fortunately, it is possible to be somewhat 
more concrete and factual in diagnosing the involvement of values in 
education. For this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and 
psychological studies of students in American colleges and universities, 
and particularly from the Cornell Values Studies. In the latter 
research program, 
information is available for 2,758 Cornell students 
surveyed in 1950 and for 1,571 students surveyed in 1952. Of the 
latter sample, 944 persons had been studied two years earlier; hence 
<changes> in attitudes and values can be analyzed for identical individuals 
at two points in time. In addition, the 1952 study collected 
comparable data from 4,585 students at ten other colleges and universities 
scattered across the country: Dartmouth, Harvard, Yale, Wesleyan, 
North Carolina, Fisk, Texas, University of California at 
Los Angeles, Wayne, and Michigan.   We find, in the first 
place, that <the students overwhelmingly approve of higher education>, 
positively evaluate the job their own institution is doing, do not 
accept most of the criticisms levelled against higher education in the 
public prints, and, on the whole, approve of the way their university 
deals with value-problems and value inculcation. It is not our impression 
that these evaluations are naively uncritical resultants of blissful 
ignorance; rather, the generality of these students find their 
university experience congenial to their own sense of values.   <Students 
are approximately equally divided between those who regard 
vocational preparation as the primary goal of an ideal education and those 
who chose a general liberal education>. Other conceivable goals, 
such as character-education and social adjustment, are of secondary 
importance to them. <The ideal of a liberal education impresses itself 
upon the students more and more as they move through college>. Even 
in such technical curricula as engineering, the senior is much more 
likely than the freshman to choose, as an ideal, liberal education over 
specific vocational preparation. In the university milieu of scholarship 
and research, of social diversity, of new ideas and varied and 
wide-ranging interests, "socialization" into a campus culture apparently 
means heightened appreciation of the idea of a liberal education 
in the arts and sciences.   Students' <choices> of ideal 
educational goals <are not arbitrary or whimsical>. There is a clear 
relationship between their educational evaluations and their basic 
pattern of general values. The selective and directional qualities of 
basic value-orientations are clearly evident in these data: the 
"success-oriented" 
students choose vocational preparation, the "other-directed" 
choose goals of social adjustment ("getting along with 
people"), the "intellectuals" choose a liberal arts emphasis.

The same patterned consistency shows itself in occupational choices. 
There is <impressive consistency between specific occupational 
preferences and the student's basic conception of what is for him a 
good way of life>. And, contrary to many popular assertions, the <goal-values 
chosen do not seem to us to be primarily oriented to materialistic 
success nor to mere conformity>. Our students want occupations 
that permit them to use their talents and training, to be creative 
and original, to work with and to help other people. They also want 
money, prestige, and security. But they are <optimistic about their 
prospects> in these regards; they set <limits to their aspirations>- 
few aspire to millions of dollars or to "imperial" power and 
glory. Within the fixed frame of these aspirations, they can afford 
to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspects of 
occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward values of power, 
prestige, and wealth.   Occupational choices are also useful- 
and interesting- in bringing out clearly that values do not constitute 
the only component in goals and aspirations. For there is also the 
"face of reality" in the form of the individual's perceptions 
of 
his own abilities and interests, of the objective possibilities open 
to him, of the familial and other social pressures to which he is exposed. 
We find "reluctant recruits" whose values are not in line with 
their expected occupation's characteristics. Students develop occupational 
images- not always accurate or detailed- and they try to 
fit their values to the presumed characteristics of the imagined occupation. 
The purely cognitive or informational problems are often acute. 
Furthermore, many reluctant recruits are yielding to social demands, 
or compromising in the face of their own limitations of opportunity, 
or of ability and performance. Thus, many a creativity-oriented aspirant 
for a career in architecture, drama, or journalism, resigns himself 
to a real estate business; many a people-oriented student who dreams 
of the M&D& decides to enter his father's advertising agency; 
and many a hopeful incipient business executive decides it were 
better to teach the theory of business administration than to practice 
it. The old ideal of the independent entrepreneur is extant- but 
so is the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy.

In their views on dating, courtship, sex, and family 
life, our students prefer what they are expected to prefer. For them, 
in the grim words of a once-popular song, love and marriage go together 
like a horse and carriage. Their expressed standards concerning 
sex roles, desirable age for marriage, characteristics of an ideal mate, 
number of children desired are congruent with the values and stereotypes 
of the preceding generation- minus compulsive rebellion. They 
even accept the "double standard" of sex morality in a double sense, 
i&e&, both sexes agree that standards for men differ from standards 
for women, and women apply to both sexes a standard different from 
that held by men.   "Conservatism" and "traditionalism" 
seem implied by what has just been said. But these terms are treacherous. 
<In the field of political values, it is certainly true that 
students are not radical, not rebels against their parents or their peers>. 
And as they go through college, the students tend to bring their 
political position in line with that prevalent in the social groups 
to which they belong. Yet they have accepted most of the extant "welfare 
state" provisions for health, security, and the regulation of 
economic affairs, and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional 
"liberalism" of the Bill of Rights. When their faith in civil 
liberties is tested against strong pressures of social expediency in specific 
issues, e&g&, suppression of "dangerous ideas", many waver 
and give in. The students who are most willing to acquiesce in the 
suppression of civil liberties are also those who are most likely to 
be prejudiced against minority groups, to be conformist and traditionalistic 
in general social attitudes, and to lack a basic faith in people.

As one looks at the existing evidence, one finds a correlation, 
although only a slight one, between high grades and "libertarian" 
values. But the correlation is substantial only among upperclassmen. 
In other words, as students go through college, those who are 
most successful academically tend to become more committed to a "Bill 
of Rights" orientation. College in gross- just the general experience- 
may have varying effects, but the <the students who are successful 
emerge with strengthened and clarified democratic values>. 
This finding is consistent also with the fact that student leaders are 
more likely to be supporters of the values implicit in civil liberties 
than the other students.   There is now substantial evidence 
from several major studies of college students that <the experience of 
the college years results in a certain, selective homogenization of 
attitudes and values>. Detached from their prior statuses and social 
groups and exposed to the pervasive stimuli of the university milieu, 
the students tend to assimilate a new common <culture>, to converge 
toward norms characteristic of their own particular campus. Furthermore, 
in certain respects, there are norms common to colleges and universities 
across the country. For instance, college-educated people consistently 
show up in study after study as more often than others supporters 
of the Bill of Rights and other democratic rights and liberties. 
The interesting thing in this connection is that the norms upon which 
students tend to converge include toleration of diversity. 
To the extent that our sampling of the orientations of American college 
students in the years 1950 and 1952 may be representative of our 
culture- and still valid in 1959- <we are disposed to question the 
summary characterization of the current generation as silent, beat, 
apathetic>, or as a mass of other-directed conformists who are guided 
solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscopes. Our data 
indicate that these students of today do basically accept the existing 
institutions of the society, and, in the face of the realities of complex 
and large-scale economic and political problems, make a wary and 
ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy positions of legitimized 
responsibility for coping with such collective concerns. <In 
a real sense they are admittedly conservative>, but their conservatism 
incorporates a traditionalized embodiment of the original "radicalism" 
of 1776. Although we have no measures of its strength or intensity, 
the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable rights is retained. 
As they move through the college years our young men and women are "socialized" 
into a broadly similar culture, at the level of personal
