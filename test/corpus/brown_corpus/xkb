recent popular novels and stories like Fred Hoyle's <The Black 
Cloud> (1957); and among works of dystopian science fiction, not 
all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit as literature- 
but then real quality has always been scarce in science fiction. 
In addition, there are many areas of the human situation besides 
the impact of science and technology which are examined, for science-fiction 
dystopias often extrapolate political, social, economic tendencies 
only indirectly related to science and technology. Nevertheless, 
with all these qualifications and exceptions, the current dystopian 
phenomenon remains impressive for its criticism that science and technology, 
instead of bringing utopia, may well enslave, dehumanize, and even 
destroy men. How effectively these warnings can be presented is seen 
in Pohl and Kornbluth's <The Space Merchants,> Vonnegut's 
<Player Piano> and Wyndham's <Re-Birth>.   Easily 
the best known of these three novels is <The Space Merchants,> a 
good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolates much more 
than the impact of science on human life, though its most important 
warning is in this area, namely as to the use to which discoveries in 
the behavioral sciences may be put. The novel, which is not merely dystopian 
but also brilliantly satiric, describes a future America where 
one-sixteenth of the population, the men who run advertising agencies 
and big corporations, control the rest of the people, the submerged 
fifteen-sixteenths who are the workers and consumers, with the government 
being no more than "a clearing house for pressures". Like 
ours, the economy of the space merchants must constantly expand in order 
to survive, and, like ours, it is based on the principle of "ever 
increasing everybody's work and profits in the circle of consumption". 
The consequences, of course, have been dreadful: reckless expansion 
has led to overpopulation, pollution of the earth and depletion 
of its natural resources. For example, even the most successful executive 
lives in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in 
the stairwells of office buildings in which to sleep at night; soyaburgers 
have replaced meat, and wood has become so precious that it is 
saved for expensive jewelry; and the atmosphere is so befouled that 
no one dares walk in the open without respirators or soot plugs.

While <The Space Merchants> indicates, as Kingsley Amis has 
correctly observed, some of the "impending consequences of the growth 
of industrial and commercial power" and satirizes "existing habits 
in the advertising profession", its warning and analysis penetrate 
much deeper. What is wrong with advertising is not only that it is 
an "outrage, an assault on people's mental privacy" or that it 
is a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contains 
a coercive tendency (which is closer to the point). Rather what Kornbluth 
and Pohl are really doing is warning against the dangers inherent 
in perfecting "a science of man and his motives". <The Space 
Merchants,> like such humanist documents as Joseph Wood Krutch's 
<The Measure of Man> and C& S& Lewis's <The Abolition 
of Man,> considers what may result from the scientific study 
of human nature. If man is actually the product of his environment 
and if science can discover the laws of human nature and the ways in which 
environment determines what people do, then someone- a someone 
probably standing outside traditional systems of values- can turn around 
and develop completely efficient means for controlling people. Thus 
we will have a society consisting of the planners or conditioners, 
and the controlled. And this, of course, is exactly what Madison Avenue 
has been accused of doing albeit in a primitive way, with its "hidden 
persuaders" and what the space merchants accomplish with much 
greater sophistication and precision.   Pohl and Kornbluth's 
ad men have long since thrown out appeals to reason and developed techniques 
of advertising which tie in with "every basic trauma and neurosis 
in American life", which work on the libido of consumers, which 
are linked to the "great prime motivations of the human spirit". 
As the hero, Mitchell Courtenay, explains before his conversion, 
the job of advertising is "to convince people without letting them 
know that they're being convinced". And to do this requires first 
of all the kind of information about people which is provided by the 
scientists in industrial anthropology and consumer research, who, for 
example, tell Courtenay that three days is the "optimum priming period 
for a closed social circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase"- 
which means that an effective propaganda technique is to send 
an idea into circulation and then three days later reinforce or undermine 
it. And the second requirement for convincing people without 
their knowledge is artistic talent to prepare the words and pictures which 
persuade by using the principles which the scientists have discovered. 
Thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchants is the 
person who in earlier ages might have been a lyric poet, the person "capable 
of putting together words that stir and move and sing". As 
Courtenay explains, "Here in this profession we reach into the souls 
of men and women. And we do it by taking talent- and redirecting 
it".   Now the basic question to be asked in this situation 
is what motivates the manipulators, that is, what are their values?- 
since, as Courtenay says, "Nobody should play with lives the way 
we do unless he's motivated by the highest ideals". But the only 
ideal he can think of is "Sales"! Indeed, again and again, the 
space merchants confirm the prediction of the humanists that the conditioners 
and behavioral scientists, once they have seen through human 
nature, will have nothing except their impulses and desires to guide 
them.

We often say of a person that he "looks young for his age" 
or "old for his age". Yet even in the more extreme of such cases 
we seldom go very far astray in guessing what his age actually is. And 
this means, I suppose, that almost invariably age reveals itself by 
easily recognizable signs engraved on both the body and the mind. "Young 
for his age" means only the presence of some minor characteristic 
not quite usual. Stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis are nevertheless 
there. An assumption of youth, or the presence of a few youthful 
characteristics, deceives no more successfully than rouge or dyed 
hair. "Looking young for your age" means "for your age" and 
it means no more.   A mind expressing itself in words may reveal 
itself a little less obviously as old or young. Its surface loses its 
bloom and submits to its wrinkles in ways less immediately obvious 
than the body does. Youth may be, and often is, skeptical, cynical or 
despairing; age may be idealistic, believing and much given to professions 
of optimism. But there is, nevertheless, always a subtle difference 
in the way in which supposedly similar opinions are held. The 
pessimism of the young is defiant, anxious to confess or even exaggerate 
its ostensible gloom, and so exuberant as to reveal the fact that 
it regards 
its ability to face up to the awful truth as more than enough to compensate 
for the awfulness of that truth. Similarly the optimism of age 
protests too much. If it proclaims that the best is yet to be, it always 
arouses, at least in the young, either a suspicious question or perhaps 
the exclamation of the Negro youth who saw on a tombstone the 
inscription, "I am not dead but sleeping". "Boy, you ain't fooling 
nobody but yourself".   We may say of some unfortunates 
that they were never young. We cannot truthfully say of anyone who has 
succeeded in entering deep into his sixties that he was never old. 
Those famous lines of the Greek Anthology with which a fading beauty 
dedicates her mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude: 
"Venus take my votive glass, Since I am not what I was, What 
from this day I shall be, Venus, let me never see".   No 
good can come of contemplating the sad, inevitable fact that once youth 
has passed "a worse and worse time still succeeds the former". 
But there are at least two reasons for contemplating one's <mind> 
in even a cracked mirror. One is that there sometimes are real although 
inadequate compensations in growing old. Serenity, if one is fortunate 
enough to achieve it, is not so good as joy, but it is something. 
Even to be "from hope and fear set free" is at least better than 
to have lost the first without having got rid of the second. The other 
reason (and the one with which I am here concerned) is that one thus 
becomes inclined to inquire of any opinion, or change of opinion, 
whether it represents the wisdom of experience or is only the result of 
the difference between youth and age which is as inevitable as the all 
too obvious physical differences. One may be exasperatingly aware 
that if the answer is favorable it will be judged such only by those of 
one's own age. But at least the question has been raised. Many readers 
of this department no doubt discount certain of my opinions for 
the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately, even if they 
have never actually been told, what my age is. At least I should like 
them to know that I know these discounts are being made. ##

Let 
me then (and in public) glance into the mirror. I have known some 
men and women who said that the selves they are told about or even remember 
seem utter strangers to them now; that their remote past is as 
discontinuous with their present selves, as lacking in any conscious 
likeness to their mature personality, as the self of a butterfly may be 
imagined discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once was. For 
my part I find it difficult to conceive such a state of affairs. I 
have changed and I have reversed opinions; but I am so aware of an 
uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that I see only as absurd 
the tendency of some psychologists from Heraclitus to Pirandello 
and Proust to regard consciousness as no more than a flux amid which 
nothing remains unchanged. So far as I am concerned, the child is 
unmistakably father to the man, despite the obvious fact that child and 
father differ greatly- sometimes for the better and sometimes for 
the worse.   Fundamental values, temperament and the way in which 
one approaches a conviction change less, of course, than specific opinions. 
That fact is very clearly illustrated in the case of the many 
present-day intellectuals who were Communists or near-Communists in 
their youth and are now so extremely conservative (or reactionary, as 
many would say) that they can define no important political conviction 
that does not seem so far from even a centrist position as to make 
the distinction between Mr& Nixon and Mr& Khrushchev for them 
hardly worth noting. But in ways more fundamental than specific political 
opinions they are still what they always were: passionate, sure 
without a shadow of doubt of whatever it is that they are sure of, capable 
of seeing black and white only and, therefore, committed to the 
logical extreme of whatever it is they are temporarily committed to.

To those of my readers who find many of my opinions morally, or 
politically, or sociologically antiquated (and I have reason to know 
that there are some such), I would like to say what I have already 
hinted, namely, that some of my opinions may indeed be subject to some 
discount on the simple ground that I am no longer young and therefore 
incapable of being youthful of mind. But I will also remind them that 
I have always been inclined to skepticism, to a kind of Laodicean 
lack of commitment so far as public affairs are concerned; so that, 
although not as eager as I once was to be disapproved of, I can still 
resist prevailing opinions.   At about the age of twelve I became 
a Spencerian liberal, and I have always considered myself a liberal 
of some kind even though the definition has changed repeatedly since 
Spencer became a reactionary. Several times in my youth I voted 
the Socialist ticket, but less because I was Socialist than because 
I was not either a Republican or a Democrat, and I voted for 
Franklin Roosevelt every time he was a candidate. Yet during the years 
when I was on the staff of the <Nation,> I tried to the limit 
the patience of the editors on almost every occasion when I was permitted 
to write an editorial having a bearing on a political or social 
question.   Never once during the trying thirties did I come so 
close to succumbing to the private climate of opinion as to grant Russian 
communism even that most weasel-worded of encomiums "an interesting 
experiment". There are few things of which I am prouder than 
of that unblemished record. Many of my friends at the time thought that 
I had received a well-deserved condemnation when Lincoln Steffens 
denounced me in a review of one of my books as a perfect example of 
the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead
