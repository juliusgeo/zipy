Yet somehow, when officers were prodded into visiting Taliesin to 
execute the warrants, they would find neither Wright nor Olgivanna 
at home. This showed that common sense had not died out at the county 
and village level- though why the unhappy and obviously unbalanced 
woman was not restrained remains a puzzle. The misery of Miriam's 
bitterness can be felt today by anyone who studies the case- it was 
hopeless, agonizing, and destructive, with Miriam herself bearing the 
heaviest burden of shame and pain.   To get an idea of the embarrassment 
and chagrin that was heaped upon Wright and Olgivanna, we 
should bear in mind that the raids were sometimes led by Miriam in person. 
One of the most distressing of these scenes occurred at Spring 
Green toward the end of the open warfare, on a beautiful day in June. 
At this time Miriam Noel appeared, urging on Constable Henry Pengally, 
whose name showed him to be a descendant of the Welsh settlers 
in the neighborhood. A troop of reporters brought up the rear. Miriam 
was stopped at the Taliesin gate, and William Weston, now the 
estate foreman, came out to parley. He said that Mr& Wright was 
not in, and so could not be arrested on something called a peace warrant 
that Miriam was waving in the air. Miriam now ordered Pengally to 
break down the gate, but he said he really couldn't go that far. At 
this point Mrs& Frances Cupply, one of Wright's handsome daughters 
by his first wife, came from the house and tried to calm Miriam 
as she tore down a NO VISITORS sign and smashed the glass pane 
on another sign with a rock.   Miriam Noel Wright said, "Here 
I am at my own home, locked out so I must stand in the road"! 
Then she rounded on Weston and cried, "You always did Wright's 
dirty work! When I take over Taliesin, the first thing I'll 
do is fire you".   "Madame Noel, I think you had better 
go", said Mrs& Cupply.   "And I think <you> had better 
leave", replied Miriam. Turning to the reporters, she asked, "Did 
you hear her? 'I think you had better leave'! And this 
is my own home". In the silence that followed, Miriam walked close 
to Mrs& Cupply, who drew back a step on her side of the gate. Then, 
with staring eyes and lips drawn thin, Miriam said to the young woman, 
"You are ugly- uglier than you used to be, and you were always 
very ugly. You are even uglier than Mr& Wright".   The 
animosity expressed by such a scene had the penetrating quality of a 
natural force; and it gave Miriam Noel a fund of energy like that 
of a person inspired to complete some great and universal work of art. 
As if to make certain that Wright would be unable to pay any settlement 
at all, Miriam wrote to prospective clients denouncing him; she 
also went to Washington and appealed to Senator George William 
Norris of Nebraska, the Fighting Liberal, from whose office a sympathetic 
but cautious harrumphing was heard. Then, after overtures to 
accept a settlement and go through with a divorce, Miriam gave a ghastly 
echo of Mrs& Micawber by suddenly stating, "I will never leave 
Mr& Wright".   Under this kind of pressure, it is not 
surprising that Wright would make sweeping statements to the newspapers. 
Miriam had not yet goaded him into mentioning her directly, but one 
can feel the generalized anger in Wright's remarks to reporters 
when he was asked, one morning on arrival in Chicago, what he thought 
of the city as a whole. First, Wright said, he was choked by the smoke, 
which fortunately kept him from seeing the dreadful town. But surely 
Michigan Avenue was handsome? "That isn't a boulevard, it's 
a racetrack"! cried Wright, showing that automobiles were considered 
to be a danger as early as the 1920's. "This is a horrible 
way to live", Wright went on. "You are being strangled by traffic". 
He was then asked for a solution of the difficulty, and began 
to talk trenchant sense, though private anguish showed through in the 
vehemence of his manner. "Take a gigantic knife and sweep it over 
the Loop", Wright said. "Cut off every building at the seventh 
floor. Spread everything out. You don't need concentration. If 
you cut down these horrible buildings you'll have no more traffic jams. 
You'll have trees again. You'll have some joy in the life of 
this city. After all, that's the job of the architect- to give 
the world a little joy".

Little enough joy was afforded Wright 
in the spring of 1925, when another destructive fire broke out at Taliesin. 
The first news stories had it that this blaze was started by 
a bolt of lightning, as though Miriam could call down fire from heaven 
like a prophet of the Old Testament. A storm did take place that 
night, and fortunately enough, it included a cloudburst that helped put 
out the flames. Later accounts blamed defective wiring for starting 
the fire; at any rate, heat grew so intense in the main part of the 
house that it melted the window panes, and fused the K'ang-si pottery 
to cinders. Wright set his loss at $200,000, a figure perhaps justified 
by the unique character of the house that had been ruined, and 
the faultless taste that had gone into the selection of the prints and 
other things that were destroyed. In spite of the disaster, Wright 
completed during this period plans for the Lake Tahoe resort, in which 
he suggested the shapes of American Indian tepees- a project of 
great and appropriate charm, that came to nothing. Amid a shortage of 
profitable work, the memory of Albert Johnson's $20,000 stood out 
in lonely grandeur- the money had quickly melted away. A series of 
conferences with friends and bankers began about this time; and the 
question before these meetings was, here is a man of international reputation 
and proved earning power; how can he be financed so that he 
can find the work he ought to do? While this was under consideration, 
dauntless as ever Wright set about the building of Taliesin /3,.

As he made plans for the new Taliesin, Wright also got on 
paper his conception of a cathedral of steel and glass to house a congregation 
of all faiths, and the idea for a planetarium with a sloping 
ramp. Years were to pass before these plans came off the paper, and 
Wright was justified in thinking, as the projects failed, that much 
of what he had to show his country and the world would never be seen except 
by visitors to Taliesin. And now there was some question as to 
his continued residence there. Billy Koch, who had once worked for 
Wright as a chauffeur, gave a deposition for Miriam's use that he 
had seen Olgivanna living at Taliesin. This might put Wright in such 
a bad light before a court that Miriam would be awarded Taliesin; 
nor was she moved by a letter from Wright pointing out that if he 
was not "compelled to spend money on useless lawyer's bills, useless 
hotel bills, and useless doctor's bills", he could more quickly 
provide Miriam with a suitable home either in Los Angeles or Paris, 
as she preferred. Miriam sniffed at this, and complained that Wright 
had said unkind things about her to reporters. His reply was, "Everything 
that has been printed derogatory to you, purporting to have 
come from me, was a betrayal, and nothing yet has been printed which 
I have sanctioned". What irritated Miriam was that Wright had told 
the papers about a reasonable offer he had made, which he considered 
she would accept "when she tires of publicity". From her California 
headquarters, Miriam fired back, "I shall never divorce Mr& 
Wright, to permit him to marry Olga Milanoff".   Then Miriam 
varied the senseless psychological warfare by suddenly withdrawing 
a suit for separate maintenance that had been pending, and asking 
for divorce on the grounds of cruelty, with the understanding that Wright 
would not contest it. The Bank of Wisconsin sent a representative 
to the judge's chambers in Madison to give information on Wright's 
ability to meet the terms. He said that the architect might reasonably 
be expected to carry his financial burdens if all harrassment 
could be brought to an end, and that the bank would accept a mortgage 
on Taliesin to help bring this about. Miriam said that she must be 
assured that "that other woman, Olga, will not be in luxury while I 
am scraping along". This exhausted Wright's patience, and in consequence 
he talked freely to reporters in a Madison hotel suite. "Volstead 
laws, speed laws, divorce laws", he said, "as they now 
stand, demoralize the individual, make liars and law breakers of us in 
one way or another, and tend to make our experiment in democracy absurd. 
If Mrs& Wright doesn't accept the terms in the morning, I'll 
go either to Tokyo or to Holland, to do what I can. I realize, 
in taking this stand, just what it means to me and mine". Here Wright 
gave a slight sigh of weariness, and continued, "It means more 
long years lived across the social grain of the life of our people, 
making shift to live in the face of popular disrespect and misunderstanding 
as I best can for myself and those dependent upon me". Next 
day, word came that Miriam was not going through with the divorce; 
but Wright stayed in the United States. His mentioning of Japan and 
Holland had been merely the expression of wishful thinking. No matter 
what troubles might betide him, this most American of artists knew 
in his heart he could not function properly outside his native land.

In a few weeks Miriam made another sortie at Taliesin, but 
was repulsed at the locked and guarded gates. 
More likely, you simply told yourself, as you handed us the book, that 
it mattered little what we incanted providing we underwent the discipline 
of incantation.   For pride's sake, I will not say that 
the coy and leering vade mecum of those verses insinuated itself into 
my soul. Besides, that particular message does no more than weakly echo 
the roar in all fresh blood. But what you could not know, of course, 
was how smoothly the Victorian Fitzgerald was to lead into an American 
Fitzgerald of my own vintage under whose banner we adolescents 
were to come, if not of age, then into a bright, taut semblance of it. 
I do not suppose you ever heard of F& Scott Fitzgerald, living 
or dead, and moreover I do not suppose that, even if you had, his legend 
would have seemed to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval. 
Neither his appetites, his exacerbations, nor his despair were 
kin to yours. He might have been the man in the moon for all you could 
have understood him. But he was no man in the moon to me. Although 
his tender nights were not the ones I dreamed of, nor was it for yachts, 
sports cars, tall drinks, and swimming pools, nor yet for money or 
what money buys that I burned, I too was burning and watching myself 
burn. The flame was simply of a different kind. It was symbolized 
(at least for those of us who recognized ourselves in the image) by that 
self-consuming, elegiac candle of Edna St& Vincent Millay's, 
that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconced it became a 
beacon to us, but which in point of fact would have had to be as tall 
as a funeral taper to last even the evening, let alone the night. One 
should not, of course, pluck the head off a flower and expect its perfume 
to linger on. Yet this passion for passion, now that I look back 
on it with passion spent, seems somewhat overblown and operatic, though 
as a diva Miss Millay perfectly controlled her notes. Only what 
else was she singing but the old Song of Songs, that most ancient 
of tunes that nature plays with such unfailing response upon young nerves? 
Perhaps this is not so little. Perhaps the mere fact that by 
plucking on the nerves nature can awaken in the most ordinary of us, temporarily 
anyway, the sleeping poet, and in poets can discover their 
immortality, is the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomena to 
which we can attest? One can see it as humiliating that an extra hormone 
casually fed into our chemistry may induce us to lay down our lives 
for a lover or a friend; one can take it as no more than another 
veil torn from the mystery of the soul. But it could also be looked 
at from the other end of the spectrum. One could see this chemical determinant 
as in itself a miracle. In any case, Miss Millay's sweet-throated 
bitterness, her variations on the theme that the world was 
not only well lost for love but even well lost for lost love, her constant 
and wonderfully tragic posture, so unlike that of Fitzgerald since 
it required no scenery or props, drew from the me that I was when 
I fell upon her verses an overwhelming yea.   But all this, I 
am well aware, is the <bel canto> of love, and although I have always 
liked to think that it was to the <bel canto> and to that alone 
that I listened, I know well enough that it was not. If I am to speak 
the whole truth about my knowledge of love, I will have to stop 
trying to emulate the transcendant nightingale. There is another side 
of love, more nearly symbolized by the croak of the mating capercailzie, 
or better still perhaps by the mute antics of the slug.   Whether 
you experienced the passion of desire I have, of course, no way 
of knowing, nor indeed have I wished with even the most fleeting fragment 
of a wish to know, for the fact that one constitutes by one's
