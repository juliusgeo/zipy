seems almost a footnote to the splendor of the Coronation Scene, 
with its dazzling confusion of tonalities. We have a brief glimpse 
of the Tsar's public personality, the "official Boris", but our 
real focus is on the excitement of the crowd- a signigicant contrast 
with its halfhearted acclamation in the opening scene, its bitter 
resentment and fury in the final act.   One reason for the unique 
vitality of the chorus is its great variety in expression. It rarely 
speaks as a unit. Even in its most conventional appearance, the guests' 
song of praise to Marina, there are a few female dissenters criticizing 
the princess for her coldness. In many passages- for example, 
the council of boyars- each section of the chorus becomes a character 
group with a particular opinion. Hot arguments arise between 
tenors and basses, who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an 
idea.   The opening scene shows this method at its most individual. 
Mussorgsky paints a telling picture of the common people, those 
who must suffer the effects of their rulers' struggle for power without 
understanding the causes. They are held in control by force, but 
barely. They will kneel and plead for Boris' leadership in a strangely 
intense song, its phrases irregularly broken as if gasping for breath, 
but when the police with their cudgels move away, they mock and 
grumble and fight among themselves. There is a quick change from the 
plaintive song to a conversational tone. "Hey, Mityukh", asks one 
group, "what are we shouting about"? And Mityukh, apparently 
the intellectual leader of the crowd, replies that he has no notion. 
The jokes and arguments grow louder until the police return; then 
the people strike up their song with even more fervor than before, ending 
it with a wail of despair.   Mussorgsky frequently uses liturgical 
music with considerable dramatic force. In Pimen's cell the 
soft prayers of the monks, heard from offstage, not only help to set 
the scene but emphasize the contrast between young Grigori's thoughts 
and his situation. This is especially striking between Pimen's 
quiet exit and Grigori's vehement outburst against Boris. 
Again, as Boris feels himself nearing death, a procession files into 
the hall singing a hymn, its modal harmonies adding a churchly touch 
to the grim atmosphere: @ The words are hardly calculated 
to put the Tsar's mind at ease. They echo the words with which 
he has described his own vision of the dying child who "trembles and 
begs for mercy- and there is no mercy". The living as well as 
the dead now accuse him; this final reminder of his guilt is the fatal 
one.   One of the outstanding assets of the present production 
is the restoration of the St& Basil's scene, usually omitted 
from performances and rarely included in a published score. Though brief, 
it has a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy. In addition, 
it is an important link in the plot, giving us a revealing glimpse of 
the people's attitude toward Boris and the false Dimitri. The mayhem 
in the forest of Kromy is a natural sequel.   The St& Basil's 
scene opens with little groups of beggars milling around the 
square, the ever present police keeping them under scrutiny. In the 
orchestra we hear first a hushed, hesitant <pizzicato> figure, then 
the insistent "police" motif as it appeared in the opening scene.

The service is over, and a number of people come from the church 
with their spokesman Mityukh in the lead. They bring the news that 
the Pretender has been excommunicated; this is met with scorn by 
the hearers, who claim that Mityukh is lying or drunk. (Mussorgsky cleverly 
contrasts the two groups by their orchestral accompaniment, solemn 
chords or mocking staccatos.) There is still more news, Mityukh 
announces: they have prayed for the soul of the Tsarevich. 
SO FAR THESE remarks, like most criticisms of Hardy, have tacitly 
assumed that his poetry is all of a piece, one solid mass of verse 
expressing a sensibility at a single stage of development. For critics, 
Hardy has had no poetic periods- one does not speak of early Hardy 
or late Hardy, or of the London or Max Gate period, but simply 
of Hardy, as of a poetic monolith. This seems odd when one recalls 
that he wrote poetry longer than any other major English poet: "Domicilium" 
is dated "between 1857 and 1860"; "Seeing the 
Moon Rise" is dated August, 1927. One might expect that in a poetic 
career of seventy-odd years, some changes in style and method would 
have occurred, some development taken place.   This is not, however, 
the case, and development is a term which we can apply to Hardy 
only in a very limited sense. In a time when poetic style, and poetic 
belief as well, seem in a state of continual flux, Hardy stands out 
as a poet of almost perverse consistency. Though he struggled with 
philosophy all his life, he never got much beyond the pessimism of his 
twenties; the "sober opinion" of his letter to Noyes, written 
when Hardy was eighty years old, is essentially that of his first "philosophical" 
notebook entry, made when he was twenty-five: 
"The 
world does not despise us: it only neglects us" (<Early Life,> 
p& 63). And though in his later years he revised his poems many 
times, the revisions did not alter the essential nature of the style 
which he had established before he was thirty; so that, while it usually 
is easy to recognize a poem by Hardy, it is difficult to date one.

There is only one sense in which it is valid to talk about 
Hardy's development: he did develop toward a more consistent and 
more effective control of that tone which we recognize as uniquely his. 
There is only one Hardy style, but in the earlier poems that style 
is only intermittently evident, and when it is not, the style is the 
style of another poet, or of the fashion of the time. In the later poems, 
however, the personal tone predominates. The bad early poems are 
bad Shakespeare or bad Swinburne; the bad late poems are bad 
Hardy.

There are two ways of getting at a poet's development: 
through his dated poems, and through the revisions which he made in later 
editions of his work. About a quarter of Hardy's poems carry 
an appended date line, usually the year of completion, but sometimes inclusive 
years ("1908-1910") or two separate dates when Hardy worked 
on the poem ("1905 and 1926") or an approximate date ("During 
the War"). These dates are virtually the only clues we have to 
the chronology of the poems, since the separate volumes are neither chronological 
within themselves nor in relation to each other. With the 
exception of <Satires of Circumstance,> each volume contains dated 
poems ranging over several decades (<Winter Words> spans sixty-one 
years); the internal organization rarely has any chronological order, 
except in obvious groups like the "Poems of Pilgrimage", the 
"Poems of 1912-13", and the war poems.   From the dated poems 
we can venture certain conclusions about Hardy's career in poetry, 
always remembering that conclusions based on a fraction of the whole 
must remain tentative. The dated poems suggest that while Hardy's 
concern with poetry may have been constant, his production was not. 
He had two productive periods, one in the late 1860's, the other 
in the decade from 1910 to 1920 (half of the dated poems are from the 
latter period, and these alone total about one-tenth of all Hardy's 
poems). There was one sterile period: only one poem is dated between 
1872 and 1882 and, except for the poems written on the trip to Italy 
in 1887, very few from 1882 to 1890.   The dated poems also 
give us an idea of the degree to which Hardy drew upon past productions 
for his various volumes, and therefore probably are an indication 
of the amount of poetry he was writing at the time. <Poems of the Past 
and the Present> and <Time's Laughingstocks,> both published 
while Hardy was at work on <The Dynasts,> draw heavily on poems 
written before 1900. <Satires of Circumstance> and <Moments of 
Vision,> coming during his most productive decade, are relatively self-contained; 
the former contains no poem dated before 1909-10- that 
is, no poem from a period covered by a previous volume- and the 
latter has only a few such. The last three volumes are again more dependent 
on the past, as Hardy's creative powers declined in his old 
age.   These observations about Hardy's productivity tally with 
the details of his life as we know them. The first productive period 
came when he was considering poetry as a vocation, before he had decided 
to write fiction for a living (in his note for <Who's Who> 
he wrote that he "wrote verses 1865-1868; gave up verse for prose, 
1868-70; but resumed it later"). During the poetically sterile 
years he was writing novels at the rate of almost one a year and was, 
in addition, burdened with bad health (he spent six months in bed in 1881, 
too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at <A Laodicean>). 
Two entries in the <Early Life> support the assumption that 
during this period Hardy had virtually suspended the writing of poetry. 
Mrs& Hardy records that "**h at the end of November [1881] 
he makes a note of an intention to resume poetry as soon as possible" 
(<Early Life,> p& 188); and on Christmas Day, 1890, Hardy 
wrote: "While thinking of resuming 'the viewless wings of 
poesy' before dawn this morning, new horizons seemed to open, and worrying 
pettinesses to disappear" (<Early Life,> p& 302). There 
are more poems dated in the 1890's than in the '80's- Hardy 
had apparently resumed the viewless wings as he decreased the volume 
of his fiction- but none in 1891, the year of <Tess>, and only one 
in 1895, the year of <Jude>. After 1895 the number increases, and 
in the next thirty years there is only one year for which there is no 
dated poem- 1903, when Hardy was at work on <The Dynasts>.

The second productive period, the decade from 1910 to 1920, can 
be related to three events: the completion of <The Dynasts> in 1909, 
which left Hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty years; 
the death of Emma Hardy in 1912, which had a profound emotional 
effect on Hardy for which he found release in poetry; and the First 
World War. It may seem strange that a poet should come to full 
fruition in his seventies, but we have it on Hardy's own authority 
that "**h he was a child till he was sixteen, a youth till he was 
five-and-twenty, 
and a young man till he was nearly fifty" (<Early 
Life,> 
p& 42). We may carry this sequence one step further and say 
that at seventy he was a poet at the height of his powers, wanting only 
the impetus of two tragedies, one personal, the other national, to 
loose those powers in poetry.   Hardy's two productive decades 
were separated by forty years, yet between them he developed only in 
that he became more steadily himself- it was a narrowing, not an expanding 
process. Like a wise gardener, Hardy pruned away the Shakespearian 
sonnets and songs, and the elements of meter and poetic diction 
to which his personal style was not suited, and let the main stock 
of his talent flourish. The range of the later poetry is considerably 
narrower, but the number of successful poems is far greater.   We 
can see the general characteristics of the earlier decade if we look 
at two poems of very different qualities: "Revulsion" (1866) 
and "Neutral Tones" (1867). There is not much to be said for "Revulsion". 
Like about half of the 1860-70 poems, it is a sonnet 
on a conventional theme- the unhappiness of love. Almost anyone could 
have written it; it is competent in the sense that it makes a coherent 
statement without violating the rules of the sonnet form, but it 
is entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike Hardy. The language 
is the conventional language of the form; there is no phrase or image 
that sounds like Hardy or that is striking enough to give individuality 
to the poem. It is smoother than Hardy usually is, but with the 
smoothness of anonymity. It is obviously a young man's poem, written 
out of books and not out of experience; it asserts emotion 
without evoking it- that is to say, it is sentimental. There are many 
such competently anonymous performances among the earlier poems.

"Neutral Tones" we immediately recognize as a fine poem in 
Hardy's most characteristic style: the plain but not quite colloquial 
language, the hard, particular, colorless images, the slightly odd 
stanza-form, the dramatic handling of the occasion, the refusal to 
resolve the issue- all these we have seen in Hardy's best poems. 
The poem does not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic 
sources of diction, yet it is obviously <not> ordinary speech- 
only Hardy would say "a grin of bitterness swept thereby/Like an 
ominous bird a-wing", or "wrings with wrong", or would describe
