in remembering the real purpose of our presence, namely, Cultural 
Exchange.   Typical of such an experience was the occasion 
of a somewhat formal official welcome in the offices of the Union 
of Soviet Artists. We had looked forward to what we hoped to be our 
first informal meeting with a number of Moscow's artists. Instead, 
we became involved in a series of friendly, but overly formal, welcoming 
addresses to which we had no choice but to reply in kind. The terms 
of friendship, understanding, cooperation, etc&, tend to become 
somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use. I can only 
hope that the continuing exchange of groups and individuals between 
our countries will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion. 
The presiding female functionary, of massive proportions and forbidding 
appearance, initially did not contribute to the expressions of 
friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentlemen representing 
the arts. It was only after we had responded, with what I fear were 
similar cliches, that she went into action by questioning our desire 
for friendship and understanding with a challenge about aggressive and 
warlike actions by the U&S& Government in Cuba and Laos. She 
retreated by leaving the room when we suggested that our meeting might 
well terminate right then and there. Unfortunately she returned later, 
just as I had taken advantage of the friendlier atmosphere in the 
room by stating that perhaps an unexpected result of the Cultural Exchange 
Program would be the re-emergence of Abstract Art in Russia, 
with Social Realism regaining dominance in the U&S&. This 
gave her an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition 
that we should not presume to lecture her on Abstraction. She 
did not go so far as to say, as was done on other occasions, that 
Abstraction as well as Impressionism were a Russian invention that 
had been discarded as unwanted by the people of the U&S&S&R&

Pozatti and I could not know then that we would experience 
this sort of treatment more often in Moscow than elsewhere. We were 
to discover, in fact, that quite a number of people share with us the 
impression that, in contrast to other Soviet regions, Moscow's atmosphere 
is depressingly subdued and official. To have one's intentions 
deliberately or unintentionally misunderstood is always a waste 
of time. Until our Moscow experience, I had not considered it necessary 
to prepare any argument formally or informally. Artists simply do 
not talk to each other in that fashion; and, furthermore, I could 
not presume the implication that I spoke for American artists as a 
group. To save time, some clarification seemed necessary. The following 
is a statement read to a large and friendly group of your fellow artists 
in Leningrad:   "We have come to your land with the 
express intention of understanding and respecting your ideas and your 
ways. Our presence here should also be considered further, sincere evidence 
of the attempts by our people and their chosen government to seek 
any and all possible ways to effect closer, peaceful ties among all 
people. We are quite convinced that one of the main hopes for the future 
depends upon the informal contacts and exchanges of ideas between 
individuals.

In spite of the relatively short period of time that we 
have experienced among you, we have already seen many indications of 
your character and spirit. We are acutely aware that yours is a society 
which, in spite of several wars and many privations, has developed 
itself into one of the foremost nations of the world. Your past history 
is resplendent with the fruits of the intellect. Your present history 
is equally admirable for its industrial and scientific achievements.

We have come to you to experience something of your way of life 
while 
also attempting to acquaint you with that of ours. While we, as American 
artists, 
believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual 
activity, we would be less than honest with you, or ourselves, 
if we failed to state a specific attitude toward our own society as 
well as the international community as a whole. In stating this position, 
we should like to make it clear to you that we cannot expect artists 
and intellectuals in other lands to share our opinion in every respect. 
As a matter of fact, we prize the diversity among our own people 
so much that we will not presume to speak for all other American artists. 
But certainly, all will agree that it is not so much the knowledge 
and search for similarities between you and us, but rather the thoughtful 
exploration and acceptance of our differences which may lead 
us to our respective and desired goals with a minimum of misunderstanding.

Like yourselves, we have pride and love for our country. 
To many of us, this is a land to which we or our parents fled from totalitarian 
terror in order to live in dignified freedom. As artists we 
feel the same obligation, as do other individuals, in considering ourselves 
responsible citizens of a great nation.

<The Sane Society> is an ambitious work. Its scope is as 
broad as the question: What does it mean to live in modern society? 
A work so broad, even when it is directed by a leading idea and informed 
by a moral vision, must necessarily "fail". Even a hasty reader 
will easily find in it numerous blind spots, errors of fact and 
argument, important exclusions, areas of ignorance and prejudice, undue 
emphases on trivia, examples of broad positions supported by flimsy 
evidence, and the like. Such books are easy prey for critics. Nor need 
the critic be captious. a careful and orderly man, who values precision 
and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility, might easily be 
put off by such a book. It is a simple matter, for one so disposed, to 
take a work like <The Sane Society> and shred it into odds and 
ends. The thing can be made to look like the cluttered attic of a large 
and vigorous family- a motley jumble of discarded objects, some outworn 
and some that were never useful, some once whole and bright but 
now chipped and tarnished, some odd pieces whose history no one remembers, 
here and there a gem, everything fascinating because it suggests 
some part of the human condition- the whole adding up to nothing more 
than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the makers and users.

That could be easily done, but there is little reason in it. 
It would come down to saying that Fromm paints with a broad brush, 
and 
that, after all, is not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression 
he has from the outset. I mention these features of the book 
because they are inherent in the book's character and therefore must 
be mentioned. It would be superfluous to build a critique around them. 
There are more substantial criticisms to be made of Fromm's account 
of capitalist civilization.   It is worthwhile to recall that 
Fromm's treatment has both descriptive and normative aspects. Since 
I have already discussed his moral position, that discussion is 
incorporated by reference into the following pages, which will focus 
on the empirical and analytic side of Fromm's treatment. I shall 
first indicate a couple of weaknesses in Fromm's analysis, then argue 
that, granted these weaknesses, he still has much left that is valuable, 
and, finally, raise the general question of a philosophical versus 
a sociological approach to the question of alienation.   Almost 
no empirical work has been done on the problem of alienation. Despite 
its rather long intellectual history, alienation is still a promising 
hypothesis and not a verified theory. The idea has received much 
attention in philosophy, in literature, and in a few works of general 
social criticism, such as <The Sane Society>. What is missing is 
work that would answer, presumably by the use of survey methods and Guttman-type 
attitude scales, such questions as these: What are the 
components 
of the feeling-state described as alienation? How widespread 
is alienation? What is its incidence among the various classes 
and subgroups of the population? Taking alienation as a dependent variable, 
with what socio-structural factors is it most highly associated? 
Considered as an independent variable, how does it affect behavior 
in various sectors of life? Until such work is done, there must 
remain the nagging suspicion that alienation may be little more than 
an expression of the malaise of the intellectual, who, rejected by and 
in turn rejecting the larger society, projects his own fear and despair 
onto the broader social screen.   I am not suggesting that 
Fromm ought to do this kind of work. Nor do I think that alienation 
is nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual. 
I am saying only that until a fuller and different kind of evidence 
comes in, any discussion of alienation must be understood to have certain 
important limitations.   Until such evidence appears, we must 
make do with the evidence we have. Here, perhaps, Fromm is vulnerable, 
for he does not always use the best and most recent evidence available, 
and he sometimes selects and interprets the evidence in rather 
special ways. Three examples follow.   Fromm's analysis of alienation 
in the sphere of production centers around the concepts of the 
bureaucratization of the corporation, the separation of ownership from 
control, and the broad (and thus from the point of view of corporate 
control, ineffective) dispersion of stock ownership. For all these 
points he relies exclusively on Berle and Means's study of 1932, <The 
Modern Corporation and Private Property>. The broad conclusions 
of that pioneering work remain undisturbed, but subsequent research 
has expanded and somewhat altered their empirical support, has suggested 
important revisions in the general analytic frame of reference, and 
has sharpened the meaning of particular analytic concepts in this area. 
Fromm seems unaware of these developments.   Another example 
is his very infrequent use of the large amount of data from surveys 
designed to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on 
a broad 
range of topics: he cites such survey-type findings just three 
times. Moreover, the conclusions he draws from the findings are not 
always the only ones possible. For example, he cites the following 
data from two studies on job satisfaction: in the first study, 85 per 
cent of professionals and executives, 64 per cent of white collar people, 
and 41 per cent of factory workers expressed satisfaction with 
their jobs; in the second study, the percentages were 86 for professionals, 
74 for managerial persons, 42 for commercial employees, 56 for 
skilled workers, and 48 for semi-skilled workers. He concludes that 
these 
data show a "remarkably high" percentage of consciously dissatisfied 
and unhappy persons among factory and clerical workers. Starting 
from other value premises than Fromm's, some analysts might conclude 
that the percentages really tell us very little at all, while others 
might even conclude that the figures are remarkably low. Eric Hoffer, 
for example, once said that America was a paradise- the only 
one in the history of the world- for workingmen and small children. 
What matters is that while Fromm's reading of the data is not the 
only one possible, it is precisely the one we would expect from a writer 
who earnestly believes that every man can and ought to be happy and 
satisfied. Fromm also cites a poll on attitudes toward work restriction 
conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in 1945, in which 
49 per cent of manual workers said a man ought to turn out as much as 
he could in a day's work, while 41 per cent said he should not do 
his best but should turn out only the average amount. Fromm says these 
data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment are widespread. That 
is one way to read the findings, but again there are other ways. One 
might use such findings to indicate the strength of informal primary 
associations in the factory, an interpretation which would run counter 
to Fromm's theory of alienation. Or, he might remind Fromm that 
the 41 per cent figure is really astonishingly low: after all, the 
medieval guild system was dedicated to the proposition that 100 per 
cent of the workers ought to turn out only the average amount; and today's 
trade unions announce pretty much the same view.   In view 
of these shortcomings in both the amount and the interpretation of 
survey-type findings on public opinion, and considering the criticisms 
which can be brought against Fromm's philosophical anthropology, 
such a passage as the following cannot be taken seriously. "Are people 
happy, are they as satisfied, unconsciously, as they believe themselves
