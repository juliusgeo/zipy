are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating; it is as though some 
pressure had suddenly been lifted, allowing an intense awareness **h 
a sharpening of the senses".   Now, with the increasing interdependence 
between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need, 
that of being trusted implicitly by some creature. Two other people 
in time shared Mijbil's love: "**h it remained around us three 
that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable 
world of wave and water **h; we were his Trinity, and he behaved 
towards us **h with a mixture of trust and abuse, passion and irritation. 
In turn each of us in our own way depended, as gods do, upon his 
worship".

Yet the idyll ended. The brief details of Mijbil's 
death lend depth to the story, give it an edge of ironic tragedy. 
Man, to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty, was responsible 
in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract 
symbol of the savage in man. But then, through a strange coincidence, 
Maxwell manages to acquire Idal, a female otter, and the fascinating 
story starts once more.   One is not sure who emerges as 
the main personality of this book- Mijbil, with his rollicking ways, 
or Maxwell himself, poet, portrait painter, writer, journalist, traveller 
and zoologist, sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an 
unusual way of life, in a language at once lyrical and forceful, vivid 
and unabashed. This reviewer read the book when it was first brought 
out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement. Now Gavin 
Maxwell's ring of bright water has widened to enchant the world. 

_NEW YORK_- The performances of the Comedie Francaise are the 
most important recent events in the New York theater.   They 
serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats, 
as accurately as possible, the techniques of acting the classics that 
prevailed in the 17th century. On the contrary, the old plays are continually 
being reinterpreted, and each new production of a classic has 
only a brief history at the Comedie.   Of course, the well-received 
revivals last longer than the others, and that further reminds 
us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism. The directors of 
the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient 
a manner as the Broadway producers who, in two instances this 
season, closed their plays after one performance. But they are aware 
of the world outside, they court public approval, they delight in full 
houses, and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic 
classic.   In France, novel approaches to the classic French 
plays are frequently attempted. The government pays a subsidy 
for revival of the classics, and this policy attracts experimenters who 
sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve 
interesting results.   So far as I know, the Comedie has never 
put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century, but 
they do reinterpret plays and characters. Last season, the Comedie's 
two principal experiments came to grief, and, in consequence, we can 
expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's "Phedre" 
and Moliere's "School for Wives".   The new 
"Phedre" was done in 17th century setting, instead of ancient Greek; 
perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this 
play's characters into our own time. The speaking of the lines seemed 
excessively slow and stately, possibly in an effort to capture the 
spirit of 17th century elegance. A few literary men defended what they 
took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama, but 
the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.   The new "School 
for Wives" was interpreted according to a principle that 
is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy- the 
idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.

Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago, Louis 
Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns, while Fernand Ledoux, 
often performing at the Comedie, made them more gross than Moliere may 
have intended.   Apparently, Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just 
these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in "The School 
for Wives". I say "apparently" although I saw Jouvet as 
Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death; by 
that time, he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments 
of the comedy.   Arnolphe, it will be recalled, is a man 
of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be. 
The part can lend itself to serious treatment; one influential 
French critic remarked: "Pity for Arnolphe comes with age".

Accordingly, at the Comedie last year, Jean Meyer played 
a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into 
a tragedy. But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the 
play became only comedy acted rather slowly.   Wisely, the Comedie 
has brought Moliere's "Tartuffe" on its tour and has left 
"The School for Wives" at home. Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite 
who courts his benefactor's wife. Jouvet played him as a sincere 
zealot, and Ledoux, at the Comedie, made him a gross buffoon, or 
so the historians tell us.   Louis Seigner, who formerly played 
the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux, is the Tartuffe of the present 
production, which he himself directed. His Tartuffe observes the 
golden mean. His red face, his coarse gestures, and his lustful stares 
bespeak his sensuality. But his heavenward glances and his pious 
speeches are not merely perfunctory; of course, they do not reflect 
sincerity, but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his 
pious impersonation.   Occasionally, Seigner draws some justly 
deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another. The 
whole role, by the way, is a considerable transformation for anyone 
who has seen Seigner in his other parts. His normal specialty is playing 
the good-natured old man, frequently stupid or deluded but never 
mean or sly. Here, he is, quite persuasively, the very embodiment of 
meanness and slyness.   Seigner is the dean of the company, the 
oldest actor in point of continuous service. In that function, he helps 
to rebut another legend about the Comedie. We are often told that 
the Comedie has, unfortunately, life-contracts with old actors who 
are both mediocre and lazy, drawing their pay without much acting but 
probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage. 
Seigner, however, is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the 
company; among his other parts are the leads in "The Bourgeois 
Gentleman" and "The Imaginary Invalid".   In Moliere's 
farce, "The Tricks of Scapin", Robert Hirsch undertakes 
another of the great roles. Here some innovation is attempted. 
To begin with, Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever 
servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master. Hirsch's 
Scapin is healthy, cheerful, energetic, revelling in his physical 
agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he 
serves.   Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities 
he has observed in the city toughs of the real world. And surely 
his Scapin has a fresh directness, a no-nonsense quality that seems to 
make him his own master and nobody's servant.

DJANGO REINHARDT, the ill-fated gypsy, was a true artist, 
one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and 
flow into many channels.   There is hardly a jazz guitarist in 
the business today who doesn't owe something to Django. And Django 
owed much to Louis Armstrong. He told once of how he switched his 
style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records 
he bought in the Flea Market in Paris. It was the first jazz he 
had heard.   Django, who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in 
Belgium and who died in 1953 in France, was an extraordinary man. Most 
of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep 
with a cigarette. And this was before he began to play his startlingly 
beautiful jazz.   You can catch up with him- if you haven't 
already- on ~RCA-Victor's album. "Djangology", made 
up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of 
the Hot Club of France. This is a choice item and Grappely deserves 
mention too, of course. He is one of the few men in history who 
plays jazz on a violin.   They play: "Minor Swing", "Honeysuckle 
Rose", "Beyond the Sea", "Bricktop", "Heavy 
Artillery", "Djangology", "After You've Gone", "Where 
Are You, My Love"? "I Saw Stars", "Lover Man", 
"Menilmontant" and "Swing 42".   All this is great 
proceedings- get the minutes.   Kid Ory, the trombonist chicken 
farmer, is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz. He dates 
back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans. 
His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years 
than he cares to remember.   Good Time Jazz has released a nice 
two-record album which he made. He is starred against Alvin Alcorn, 
trumpet; Phil Gomez, clarinet; Cedric Haywood, piano; Julian 
Davidson, guitar; Wellman Braud, bass, and Minor Hall, drums.

The set contains "High Society", "Do What Ory 
Say", "Down Home Rag", "Careless Love", Jazz Me Blues", 
"Weary Blues", "Original Dixieland One-Step", "Bourbon 
Street Parade", "Panama", "Toot, Toot, Tootsie", 
"Oh Didn't He Ramble", "Beale Street Blues", "Maryland, 
My Maryland", "1919 Rag", "Eh, La Bas", "Mood 
Indigo", and "Bugle Call Rag".   All this will serve 
to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those 
who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late 
to lay hands on the gems.

MISCHA ELMAN shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert 
with three American composers.   His portion of the program- 
and a big portion it was- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century 
concertos for the violin: to wit, the Mendelssohn and the 
Tchaikovsky. That is an evening of music-making that would faze many 
a younger man; Mr& Elman is 70 years old.   There were 
8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they 
heard Elman. But, with all due respects and allowances, it must 
truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet, 
more mannered than musical. The occasion was sentimental; so was the 
playing. #@#

The American part of the evening consisted of Paul 
Creston's Dance Overture, William Schuman's "Chester" 
from "New England Triptych" and two works of Wallingford Riegger, 
Dance Rhythms, 
Op& 58, and a Romanza for Strings, Op& 
56~A.

The Creston is purely a potboiler, with Spanish, English, 
French and American dances mixed into the stew. The Riegger, 
with its Latin hesitation bounce, is just this side of the pale; 
like his sweet, attractive Romanza, it belongs to what the composer 
called his "Non-Dissonant (Mostly)" category of works. The Schuman 
"Chester" takes off from an old William Billings tune with 
rousing woodwind and brass effect. #@#

All these- potboilers 
or no- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively, 
colorful, unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors. It 
was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change. We have 
Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well 
as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony.

A WOMAN who undergoes artificial insemination against the 
wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of "A Question of Adultery", 
yesterday's new British import at the Apollo. 
Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation 
that would often arise, the film's extensive discussion of the 
problem seems, at best, superfluous. In its present artless, low-budget 
form, the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath.
