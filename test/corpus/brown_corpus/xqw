They slid through the wicket in the big gate, ghosted across the dark 
ground. Five minutes later they reached the horses. Barton was relieved 
to see that Carl Dill and Emmett Foster had brought extra mounts. 
He had been worried that with Miller and Rankin added to the 
escape party they would be short.   No one hurried. They walked 
the horses, heading along the river, Barton and Emmett Foster in 
the lead, seven men riding quietly through the night.   The only 
thing which would have attracted attention was that two wore the uniform 
of prison guards, three the striped suits of convicts.   Five 
miles.   In a small grove against the river they halted, turning 
deep into the protection of the trees. Foster had brought extra clothing 
also. A good man, Emmett. He had been one of the original Night 
Riders, one who had escaped the trial. It was to him that Barton 
had sent Carl Dill on Dill's release from the prison.   Clyde 
Miller was crying softly to himself, shedding his striped suit 
and fumbling into the nondescript butternut pants, the worn brown shirt. 
Kid Boyd was unusually silent, Rankin watchful, a few paces apart. 
Barton finished his dressing and extended his hand to Powers.

"I won't even try to thank you".   The ex-prison guard 
was embarrassed. He said in a studied voice, "I didn't do it for 
you. I did it for the valley. You're the only man the Night Riders 
will follow. We've been starving and I don't like to starve".

Barton turned away, his eyes falling upon Rankin beside 
his horse.   "Good luck".   The murderer lifted his head. 
"Meaning you want me to ride out"?   "You aren't 
one of us. There's nothing for you here".   "I got no place 
to go".   Barton hesitated. He did not trust Rankin, his 
violent temper, his killer instinct. But ten years in prison had taught 
him realities. They were in a fight, outweighed in both numbers and 
money. It was all right to put a bunch of ranchers onto horses, to 
call them Night Riders, to set out to attack the largest mining combination 
the country had ever seen if all they wanted was adventure. But 
if they really hoped to succeed they needed professionals, men who 
knew how to use a gun against men, who would match the killers on the 
other side.   "Your choice", he said briefly, and turned to 
Kid Boyd. "Bury those uniforms so they won't be found".

Then Barton touched Carl Dill's arm and moved off, up the river 
bank. He wanted a careful, uninterrupted report from Dill on the 
conditions in the valley.   They squatted on their heels in the 
deep mud and Dill found a cigar in his breast pocket, passing it over 
silently. He too knew the agony of going for weeks, sometimes months 
without the solace of tobacco.   Mitchell Barton drew in the fragrance 
deeply, letting the smoke lie warm and soothing in his throat 
for a moment before he exhaled.   Through the gloom he could not 
see the man beside him clearly but he knew him thoroughly. For his 
first five years in prison, they had shared a cell.   Carl Dill 
was neither a rancher nor a valley man. He had been the auditor for 
the mining syndicate, and he had stolen fifty thousand dollars of the 
syndicate's money. He had done time for the theft.   The one 
thing they had in common was their hatred. Both hated Donald Kruger. 
It had drawn them together, and since his release from prison Dill 
had worked tirelessly to effect this night's escape.   He 
said 
now, "I've got the perfect headquarters set up. The old Haskell 
mine".   Mitch Barton knew the place. Twenty years before 
a group of Easterners had bought out the Haskell claims in the rocky 
hills south of Grass Valley. They had spent a million dollars, carving 
in a road, putting up buildings, drilling their haulage tunnel. Then 
the vein had petered out and the whole project had been abandoned.

"The road's washed badly", said Dill, "but there's a 
trail you can get over with a horse. A company of cavalry couldn't 
come in there if two men were guarding that trail".   Barton 
nodded. "How do the valley people feel"?   "As mad as ever. 
But Kruger's men keep them off balance, and they don't trust 
me. I'm an outsider. When they learn you're in the hills though, 
they'll rally, don't worry about that".   Barton waited 
for a long moment, then asked the question which lay always uppermost 
in his mind.   "My boy. Did you find him"?   Dill 
was silent as if he hated to answer, and Barton had a cold, sick feeling 
of apprehension.   "He's in Morgan's Ferry".

Barton half-straightened in surprise.   "What's he doing 
there"?   Again Dill hesitated. "Dealing faro". 
"Dealing faro? How come"?   "Your sister-in-law has 
the faro bank in Cap Ayres' saloon".   Barton cursed under 
his breath. After another long pause he asked, "How many people 
know who they are"?   "Everyone. Your cousin Finley saw 
to that. He's quite a rat, you know. He sold out to Kruger's men. 
He's informed them of everything you've ever written him. He 
wants your ranch".   Barton stood up. He said tensely, "All 
right. Let's go get the boy".   Dill had come up also. "I 
was afraid of this. I almost didn't tell you".   "If 
you hadn't I'd have killed you".   Dill's voice tightened. 
"But you can't ride into the Ferry. That's what they'll 
expect you to do. They'll be there waiting for you. I understand 
how you feel about the child **h".   "The hell you do". Barton's 
voice was rougher than Dill had ever heard it. "I never 
saw him. My wife died in childbirth after I was sent away.   "I 
can't leave him there. Donald Kruger would like nothing better 
than to hold him as hostage, and I wouldn't entrust a snake to his 
tender care. I've got to get the boy. Let's ride". 

#CHAPTER 
TWO#

BARTON'S MEN CUT the telegraph wires in half a dozen 
places, carrying away whole sections to make repairs more difficult. It 
was over an hour before their escape was discovered, but still the 
news that Barton was free flashed across the central portion of the state.

It reached Donald Kruger in his massive home in Burlingame. 
It reached the mines at North San Juan and Bloomfield. It 
brought men out of bed and sent them into hurried conferences. 
For everyone involved knew that the whole valley was a powder keg, and 
Mitchell Barton the fuse which could send it into explosive violence.

Creighton Hague sat in his office above the Ione pit. The 
office was of logs, four rooms, each heated by an iron stove. The 
building was dwarfed by the scene outside. There a dozen giant monitors 
played their seventy-five-foot jets of water against the huge seam 
of tertiary gravel which was the mountainside.   The gravel was 
the bed of an ancient river, buckled in some prehistoric upheaval of 
earth. It was partially cemented by ages and pressure, yet it crumpled 
before the onslaught of the powerful streams, the force of a thousand 
fire hoses, and with the gold it held washed down through the long sluices. 
A million dollars' of gold a month. A million tons of rock 
and soil and brush.   The monitors ran twenty-four hours each day. 
Their roar, like the swelling volume of a hundred tornadoes could 
be heard for miles. Hague, like all who worked near the pits, was partly 
deafened from the constant assault against his eardrums.   He 
was a big man, wearing a neat flannel shirt against the cold foothill 
air. Fat showed in loose rolls beneath the shirt. Ten years older 
than Mitch Barton, he had clawed his way up from mucker in the pits 
to manager of the operation.   He was proud of his accomplishments, 
proud of his job, proud that Donald Kruger and his associates trusted 
him. He lived and breathed for the mining company.   No 
man could have reached his spot nor held it without being ruthless, and 
Hague had made a virtue of ruthlessness all of his life.   There 
came a ghost of noise at the office door and Hague swung to see Kodyke 
in the entrance from the outer room. Hague had never accustomed 
himself to Kodyke. The man was tall, thin, with a narrow face and 
a too-large nose. The eyes always held Hague, eyes of a dead man, lidless 
as a lizard's, with the fixed intensity of a cobra. Even Hague 
was repelled by the machinelike deadliness that was Kodyke. 
He knew nothing about the man's history. Kodyke had appeared at the 
mine one day bearing a letter from Kruger. Kodyke was to head the 
dread company police. He ran the change rooms. He threw out the hi-graders. 
He supervised the cleanups and handled the shipments of raw 
gold which each week went out to San Francisco.   Hague squeezed 
down his uneasy dislike. He pulled open the top drawer of his desk 
and drew out a tintype.   "This is Mitchell Barton. He broke 
out of Folsom last night. Apparently he bribed one of the guards. 
We want him back there or we want him dead".   Kodyke took the 
picture in a lean hand, studying it thoughtfully.   "Dangerous"?

"Dangerous, yes. You know how the ranchers in the 
valley are. They blame us for all their troubles. Ten years ago they 
blew up some of our ditches. It cost us a hundred thousand dollars 
and thirty days lost time to fix them. We don't want Barton's Night 
Riders loose again".   The gunman nodded, slipping the picture 
into his breast pocket, saying nothing.   Normally Hague 
wasted no words, but now he found himself unable to stop their flow although 
he knew Kodyke was aware of all he said. 
If she sensed any unusual preoccupation on the part of her mother, she 
did not comment upon it.   After they had finished eating, Melissa 
took Sprite the kitten under her arm- "so that Auntie Grace 
can teach it about the whistle"- and climbed into the station wagon 
beside her mother. She had offered to walk, but Pamela knew she 
would not feel comfortable about her child until she had personally confided 
her to the care of the little pink woman who chose to be called 
"Auntie".   When they reached their neighbor's house, Pamela 
said a few polite words to Grace and kissed Melissa lightly on 
the forehead, the impulse prompted by a stray thought- of the type 
to which she was frequently subject these days- that they might never 
see one another again. Then she turned the station wagon around and 
headed it back down the hill, with the village as her ostensible destination.

As she drove, she thought about her plan. It was really 
quite simple. So simple, in fact, that it might even work- although 
Pamela, now, in her new frame of mind, was careful not to pretend 
too much assurance. That mistake, she thought, had cost her dearly 
these past few days, and she wanted to avoid falling into any more of 
the traps that the mountain might set for her. She must be cautious 
so as not to alert the scheming forest.   When the station wagon 
drew abreast of the dusty dirt road that led up to the porch of the Culver 
house, Pamela turned the wheel, guiding the car to its familiar 
parking spot close to the house, and stopped. All of her movements 
were careful and methodical, partaking of the stealth of a criminal who 
has plotted his felony for months in advance and knows exactly which 
step to take next in the course of the final execution of his crime. 
She locked the ignition, removed the keys, stepped out of the car and 
went into the house. Here, she dropped the keys on a small table beside 
the door and went upstairs to her bedroom.   On her bureau lay 
a small, brass ornament of simple design and faded engraving- an 
object which, Pamela believed now, had been the property of her 
great-grandfather, 
Major Hiram Munroe Culver. He had belonged to this 
land and, perhaps, had desecrated it- and this was the only material 
symbol that remained of him. If she, Pamela, were being held responsible 
for his crimes, then hers must be the final act of expiation. She 
would return this symbol to the mountain, as one pours seed back into 
the soil every Spring **h or as ancient fertility cults demand annual 
human sacrifice.   Slowly and thoughtfully, she slipped the 
ornament into the pocket of her slacks, moved down the stairs and out 
of the house. There was only one place where the mountain might receive 
her- that unnamed, unnameable pool harbored in its secret bosom.
