well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 
million of 1960. Price support loans may total another $1 billion 
this year. With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly 
above 1960, farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion, $1.5 
billion above 1960's record high. Net income may reach $12.7 billion, 
up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953. The Government 
reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers 
rose in the month ended at mid-September for the third consecutive month, 
reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-July.

{KENNEDY OPPOSES any widespread relief from a High Court 
depletion ruling.}   The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 
was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it 
mined. The company, in figuring its taxable earnings, deducted a percentage 
of the revenue it received for its finished products. Such "depletion 
allowances", in the form of percentages of sales are authorized 
by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their 
assets. The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage 
allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground, 
not to the revenue from finished products.   A measure passed 
by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact, on 
prior-year returns still under review, for clay-mining companies that 
make brick and tile products. The measure allows such companies in 
those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the 
value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay 
alone.   <President Kennedy, in signing the relief measure 
into law, stressed he regarded it as an exception. "My approval of 
this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment 
of similar legislation for other mineral industries", the President 
said>. #@#

{CHARITABLE DEDUCTIONS come in for 
closer scrutiny by the I&R&S&.}   The Service announced 
that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement 
from the recipient organization showing the date, purpose, amount 
and other particulars of the contribution. Requests for substantiation, 
the Service indicated, can be especially expected in cases where 
it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return, such 
as tickets to a show.   In such instance, revenuers stressed, 
the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received. #@#

A RULE on the Federal deductibility of state taxes 
is contested.}   A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax 
under Federal law, on its gain from the sale of property disposed 
of in line with a plan of liquidation. Louisiana, however, collected 
an income tax on the profits from the sale. The corporation, in filing 
its final Federal income return, claimed the state tax payment as a 
deductible expense, as permitted under U&S& tax law.   The 
Revenue Service disallowed the claim, invoking a law provision that 
generally bars deductions 
for expenses incurred in connection with what 
it said was tax-exempt income. The Tax Court rejected this view. 
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the 
exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations.

<The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding 
by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old 
I&R&S& ruling on the subject. The Service has not said what 
its next step will be>. #@#

{PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS}

that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get, after

THE OWNER} of a public relations firm owed no 
income tax on payments he received from a client company and "kicked 
back" to the company's advertising manager, the Tax Court ruled. 
The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had 
to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager. The Court upheld 
the taxpayer's contention that these "kickbacks" were not his 
income though they passed through his hands. The Court limited its 
decision to the tax issue involved, commenting: "It is not our province 
to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction". #@#

A PORTABLE KEROSENE RANGE} designed for use aboard boats 
is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion

does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' 
excise tax on household-type appliances. #@#

{HIRING 
THE WIFE for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income}.

A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls, 
for example, may be entitled to distributions under the company's 
pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage. She would 
be taxed on the pensions when received, of course, but the company's 
contributions would be tax-free.   A frequent pitfall in this 
sort of arrangement, experts warn, is a tendency to pay the wife more 
than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her 
as retirement income. In that event, they note, the Revenue Service 
might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges 
under the law.   <Possible upshots: The company could 
be denied a deduction for its pension payments, or those payments for 
the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year 
made>. #@#

{STATE BRIEFS:} Voters in four counties 
containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 
2% sales tax within that area. Colorado has a 2% sales 
tax. Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed 
in the higher area tax **h. The Washington state supreme court ruled 
that the state's occupation tax applied to sales, made at cost to an 
oil company, by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain 
supplies without divulging the identity of the parent. The state's 
occupation tax is computed on gross sales. The court held that the tax 
applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic 
benefits by doing business as two separate entities. 

_WASHINGTON_- Consumer spending edged down in April after rising 
for two consecutive months, the Government reported.   The Commerce 
Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped 
to slightly under $18 billion in April, down 1% from the March 
level of more than $18.2 billion. April sales also were 5% below 
those of April last year, when volume reached a record for any month, 
$18.9 billion (see chart on Page One).   The seasonal adjustment 
takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this 
year, two weeks earlier than in 1960, and pre-Easter buying was pushed 
into March.   Commerce Department officials were inclined to 
explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer 
buying in March. Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively 
steep 2.5% from those of the month before, which in turn were slightly 
higher than the January low of $17.8 billion.

Greer Garson world-famous star of stage, screen and television, 
will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion 
with which she has created a high standard in her profession.

As a Neiman-Marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson 
is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion 
this season. She will receive the 1961 "Oscar" at the 24th annual 
Neiman-Marcus Exposition, Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand 
Ballroom of the Sheraton-Dallas Hotel. ##

{THE ONLY WOMAN} 
recipient, Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando 
Sarmi, creator of chic, beautiful women's fashions; Harry Rolnick, 
president of the Byer-Rolnick Hat Corporation and designer 
of men's hats; Sydney Wragge, creator of sophisticated casuals 
for women and Roger Vivier, designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris, 
France, whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized 
the shoe industry.   The silver and ebony plaques will be presented 
at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus, president of Neiman-Marcus, 
Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas 
Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center.

The attractive Greer Garson, who loves beautiful clothes 
and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles, prefers 
timeless classical designs. Occasionally she deserts the simple 
and elegant for a fun piece simple because "It's unlike me". ## 
{IN PRIVATE LIFE}, Miss Garson is Mrs& E& E& 
Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas, 
where 
they maintain an apartment, to their California home in Los Angeles' 
suburban Bel-Air to their ranch in Pecos, New Mexico. Therefore, 
her wardrobe is largely mobile, to be packed at a moment's notice 
and to shake out without a wrinkle.   Her creations in fashion 
are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe 
from any one designer any more than she wants "all of her pictures 
by one painter". ##

{A FAVORITE} is Norman Norell, 
however. She likes his classic chemise. Her favorite cocktail dress 
is a Norell, a black and white organdy and silk jersey.   Irene 
suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette. 
She also likes the femininity 
and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman 
and Helen Rose.   Balenciaga is her favorite European 
designer.   "I bought my first dress from him when I was still 
a struggling young actress", she reminisces. "I like his clothes 
for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has 
on fashion". ##

{BLACK AND WHITE} is her favorite color 
combination along with lively glowing pinks, reds, blues and greens.

Of Scotch-Irish-Scandinavian descent, Greer Garson was 
born in County Down, Ireland. Her mother was a Greer and her father's 
family came from the Orkney Isles.   Reared in England, 
she studied to be a teacher, earned several scholarships and was graduated 
with honors from the University of London. She took postgraduate 
work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned 
to London to work on market research with an advertising firm. ## 
{HER ACTING} began with the Birmingham Repertory Company 
and she soon became the toast of the West End. Among stage performances 
was a starring role in "Golden Arrow" directed by Noel 
Coward. It was during "Old Music" at the St& James Theater 
that Hollywood's Louis B& Mayer spotted her.   After 
signing a motion-picture contract, she came to America and had "Goodbye, 
Mr& Chips" as her first assignment after a year's wait. 
Other triumphs include "Random Harvest", "Madame Curie", 
"Pride and Prejudice", "The Forsythe Saga" and "Mrs& 
Miniver" (which won her the Academy Award in 1943). ##

{HONORS} 
that have come to Greer Garson are countless. Just this 
April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award 
for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in "Sunrise at Campobello".
