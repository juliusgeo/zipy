have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled, 'Science 
and Government'. Until the work actually appears I am 
not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail. But I have compared 
its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin 
lectures at Harvard, from which the book was derived, and I can 
with confidence challenge the gist of C& P& Snow's incautious 
tale".   Watson-Watt's remarks in> ~SR <did not then, 
constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures. 
Representatives of Harvard University Press, which is publishing 
the book this month of April, recognize and freely acknowledge 
that they invited such reaction by allowing> Life <magazine to print 
an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date. 
The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the

SIR ROBERT WATSON-WATT'S "rebuttal" 
of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout 
by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself 
from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those "falsehoods" 
in an unclear incoherent argument.   The article 
presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning. It calls the 
conclusion admitted valid by "historians and military strategists alike" 
a "perverted conclusion. **h nonsense".   It submits 
an enthusiastic, impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing 
another aspect of the man, but on no more authoritative basis than Sir 
Charles' account. We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.

The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the 
result of the tea party. But we are to believe that Lindemann actively 
supported radar outside the Tizard Committee, and dissembling, 
discounted it inside? If so, I would lean to Sir Charles' conception 
of the man.   I think it was a grave error to print the 
article at this time. To the unfortunate people unable to attend the 
Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the 
book which may dissuade some people from reading it. @

IT IS NOT NEWS that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the 
violin. Certainly not in Orchestra hall where he has played countless 
recitals, and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with 
the Chicago Symphony orchestra, playing the Brahms Concerto with 
his own slashing, demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high, pale, 
pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music, 
or forever finds it closed.   There was about that song something 
incandescent, for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat. Not 
the noblest performance we have heard him play, or the most spacious, 
or even the most eloquent. Those would be reserved for the orchestra's 
great nights when the soloist can surpass himself. This time the 
orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own 
high mood. But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only 
up to a point.   That is, when Mr& Milstein thrust straight 
to the core of the music, sparks flying, bow shredding, violin singing, 
glittering and sometimes spitting, Mr& Hendl could go along. But 
Mr& Hendl does not go straight to any point. He flounders and 
lets music sprawl. There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and 
marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist, orchestra 
and music to ultimate fusion. So we had some dazzling and memorable 
Milstein, but not great Brahms.   The concert opened with 
another big romantic score, Schumann's Overture to "Manfred", 
which suffered fate, this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic 
point to keep it afloat. Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was 
a considerably more serious misfortune, for it demands transluscent 
textures, buoyant rhythms, and astringent wit. It got the kind of scrambled, 
coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when 
the man with the baton lacks technique and style. 

#BAYREUTH NEXT 
SUMMER#

The Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production 
of "Tannhaeuser" staged by Wieland Wagner, who is doing all the 
operas this time, and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch. Sawalisch 
also conducts "The Flying Dutch", opening July 24. "Parsifal" 
follows July 25, with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting, and he 
also conducts "Die Meistersinger", to be presented Aug& 8 and 
12. The "Ring" cycles are July 26, 27, 28 and 30, and Aug& 
21, 22, 23 and 25. Rudolf Kempe conducts. No casts are listed, but 
Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano, Grace Bumbry, will 
sing Venus in "Tannhaeuser".

REMEMBER HOW BY a series of booking absurdities Chicago 
missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet? Remember how by lack of two big 
theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet? 
Well, now we have two big theaters. But barring a miracle, and 
don't hold your breath for it, Chicago will not see the Leningrad-Kirov 
Ballet, which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and 
is one of the great companies of the world.   Before you let 
loose a howl saying we announced its coming, not once but several times, 
indeed we did. The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big 
theater in McCormick Place, which Sol Hurok, ballet booker extraordinary, 
considers the finest house of its kind in the country- and 
of course he doesn't weep at the capacity, either. #@#

It 
was all set. Allied Arts corporation first listed the Chicago dates 
as Dec& 4 thru 10. Later the Hurok office made it Dec& 8 thru 
17, a nice, long booking for the full repertory. But if you keep a calendar 
of events, as we do, you noticed a conflict. Allied Arts had 
booked Marlene Dietrich into McCormick Place Dec& 8 and 9. Something 
had to give. Not La Dietrich. Allied Arts then notified 
us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking, fly here 
to open Nov& 28, and close Dec& 2. Shorter booking, but still 
a booking. We printed it.   A couple of days later a balletomane 
told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was 
told "the newspapers had made a mistake". So I started making 
some calls of my own. These are the results. #@#

The Kirov Ballet 
is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, Nov& 
21 thru Dec& 4. Not a chance of opening here Nov& 28- 
barring that miracle. Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held 
for us? Well, Dietrich won't budge from McCormick Place. Then 
how about the Civic Opera house? Well, Allied Arts has booked 
Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec& 4.   Queried about 
the impasse, Allied Arts said: "Better cancel the Kirov for 
the time being. It's all up in the air again".   So the Kirov 
will fly back to Russia, minus a Chicago engagement, a serious 
loss for dance fans- and for the frustrated bookers, cancellation of 
one of the richest bookings in the country.   Will somebody please 
reopen the Auditorium?

Paintings and drawings by Marie Moore of St& Thomas, Virgin 
Islands, are shown thru Nov& 5 at the Meadows gallery, 3211 
Ellis av&, week days, 3 p& m& to 8 p& m&, Sundays 3 p& m& 
to 6 p& m&, closed Mondays. @ #@#

An exhibition of 
Evelyn Cibula's paintings will open with a reception Nov& 5 at 
the Evanston Community center, 828 Davis st&. It will continue all 
month. #@#

Abstractions and semi-abstractions by Everett McNear 
are being exhibited by the University gallery of Notre Dame 
until Nov& 5.

In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget, the Dallas 
Civic Opera will use San Francisco's new Leni Bauer-Ecsy 
production of "Lucia di Lammermoor" this season, returning the favor 
next season when San Francisco uses the Dallas "Don Giovanni", 
designed by Franco Zeffirelli.

H E& BATES has scribbled a farce called "Hark, Hark, 
the Lark"! It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible 
novels of the season.   If there is a moral lurking among the 
shenanigans, it is hard to find. Perhaps the lesson we should take from 
these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild 
scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics.   Anyway, a number of 
them meet here in devastating collisions. One is an imperial London 
stockbroker called Jerebohm. Another is a wily countryman called Larkin, 
whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled, I believe, 
in earlier volumes of Mr& Bates' comedie humaine.   What's 
up now? Well, Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the 
stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive 
rustic simplicities.   They want to own a junior-grade castle, 
or a manor house, or some modest little place where Shakespeare might 
once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded 
courtiers.   They are willing to settle, however, in anything 
that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at. And of course 
Larkin has just the thing they want. 

#SPLENDOR BY SORCERY# 

It's a horror. The name of it is Gore Court, and it is surrounded 
by a wasteland that would impress T& S& Eliot. That's not 
precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it, though. He conjures 
herds 
of deer, and wild birds crowding the air.   He suggests 
that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor. The stained-glass 
windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas, the paneling 
may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform. 
The vast, dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions 
when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch.

Larkin has an answer to all that. The spaciousness of the Tudor 
cooking areas, for example, will provide needed space for the extra 
television sets required by modern butlers, cooks and maids. Also, perhaps, 
table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented.

It's a wonder, really, to how much mendacious trouble 
Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse. 
He doesn't really need the immense sum of money (probably converted 
from American gold on the London Exchange) he makes them pay.

For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot. He has 
a glorious wife and many children. When he needs money to buy something 
like, say, the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch, he 
takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies. One of those capital-gains 
ventures, in fact, has saddled him with Gore Court. He is 
willing to sell it just to get it off his hands.   And the Jerebohms 
are more than willing to buy it. They plan to become county people 
who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth. 

#FIRST 
ONE, THEN THE OTHER#

If, in Larkin's eyes, they are nothing 
but Piccadilly farmers, he has as much to learn about them as they 
have to learn about the ways of truly rural living.   Mr& Bates 
shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc. Oneupmanship 
is practiced by both sides in a total war.   First 
the Larkins are ahead, then the Jerebohms. After Larkin has been persuaded
