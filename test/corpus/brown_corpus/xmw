economic system in East Europe.   This illusion was described 
in a far-sighted editorial in the <New York Herald Tribune>, on 
March 5, 1947, in connection with the submission of the satellite peace 
treaties to the Senate. In doing so Marshall and Byrnes were "asking 
for the ratification of a grim lesson in the facts of international 
life". We had entertained exaggerated ideas about our victory 
automatically establishing our system throughout the world. "<We 
were troubled about the fate of the Baltic States. Yalta left us with 
comforting illusions of a Western capitalist-democratic political 
economy reigning supreme up to the Curzon line and the borders of Bessarabia>". 
[Italics added.]   This is a penetrating description 
of our post-war illusion, which applied to other areas than East 
Europe. The same editorial continued that "We expected to democratize 
Japan and Korea and to see a new China pattern itself easily 
on our institutions. We expected, in short, that most of the world 
would make itself over in our image and that it would be relatively simple, 
from such a position, to deal with the localized aberrations of 
the Soviet Union". Yet actually "the image corresponded in no 
way to the actualities of the post-war world. Neither our military, our 
economic nor our ideological power reached far enough" to determine 
the fate of East Europe. Then the editorial added prophetically: 
"how far they may reach in Asia is yet undetermined, but they fall 
far short of our dreams of the war conferences".   Here is 
the best short explanation of the origins of the Cold War that has been 
written. Failing to heed the lesson so clearly contained in the satellite 
treaties, President Truman re-declared the Cold War on March 
12, 1947, in the Truman Doctrine, exactly one week after the <Herald 
Tribune> editorial was written, and a year after the Cold War 
had been announced by Churchill at Fulton, Missouri, in Truman's 
presence. Then China promptly went Communist, and Mr& Truman 
had to fight the interminable Korean war for the democratization of 
Korea before we learned how far our writ did "reach in Asia".

Years of war, strain, and hatred; of heavy arms expenditures 
and constant danger of another world war had to ensue before the United 
States could bring itself to accept the two chief results of World 
War /2,- Communist control of East Europe and China. _A 
NEW BALANCE OF POWER._ While the Cold War raged it was easy to blame 
it all on Yalta. Yet, in summarizing a series of careful essays 
on the Yalta Conference, Forrest Pogue could find no basis for Yalta 
becoming "a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponents 
of Roosevelt and international cooperation". When the Yalta Papers 
were finally published with great fanfare they had revealed no betrayal 
by anyone.

An analysis of the election falls naturally in four parts. First 
is the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation, planning 
and discussion. Preparation began slightly more than a year after 
independence with the first steps to organize rural communes. All 
political interests supported electoral planning, although there are some 
signs that the inherent uncertainties of a popular judgment led to 
some procrastination. The second major aspect of the election is the 
actual procedure of registration, nomination and voting. Considerable 
technical skill was used and the administration of the elections was 
generally above reproach. However, the regionally differentiated results, 
which appear below in tables, are interesting evidence of the problems 
of developing self-government under even the most favorable circumstances. 
A third aspect, and probably the one open to most controversy, 
is the results of the election. The electoral procedure prevented 
the ready identification of party affiliation, but all vitally interested 
parties, including the government itself, were busily engaged in 
determining the party identifications of all successful candidates the 
month following the elections. The fourth and concluding point will 
be to estimate the long-run significance of the elections and how they 
figure in the current pattern of internal politics.   Elections 
have figured prominently in nearly every government program and official 
address since independence. They were stressed in the speeches 
of Si Mubarak Bekkai when the first Council of Ministers was formed 
and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role in the second Council. 
King Muhammad /5, was known to be most sympathetic to the formation 
of local self-government and made the first firm promise of elections 
on May Day, 1957. There followed a long and sometimes bitter 
discussion of the feasibility of elections for the fall of 1957, in 
which it appears that the Minister of the Interior took the most pessimistic 
view and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic. 
Since the complicated process of establishing new communes and 
reviewing the rudimentary plan left by the French did not even begin 
until the fall of 1957, this goal appears somewhat ambitious.   From 
the very beginning the electoral discussions raised fundamental issues 
in Moroccan politics, precisely the type of questions that were 
most difficult to resolve in the new government. Until the Charter 
of Liberties was issued in the fall of 1958, there were no guarantees 
of the right to assemble or to organize for political purposes. The 
Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957, but the P&D&I& (<Parti 
Democratique de l'Independance>), the most important minor 
party at the time, objected to the Istiqlal's predominance in the 
civil service and influence in Radio Maroc. There were rumors that 
the Ministry of the Interior favored an arbitrary, "non-political" 
process, which were indirectly affirmed when the King personally intervened 
in the planned meetings. The day following his intervention 
the palace issued a statement reassuring the citizens that "**h the 
possibility of introducing appeals concerning the establishment of electoral 
lists, lists of candidates and finally the holding of the consultation 
itself **h" would be supported by the King himself. 
The Ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postponed further consideration 
of elections, but French consultants were called in and notices of further 
investigation appeared from time to time. In January, 1958, the 
Minister of the Interior announced that an election law was ready 
to be submitted to the King, the rumors of election dates appeared once 
again, first for spring of 1958 and later for the summer. Although 
the government was probably prepared for elections by mid-1958, the 
first decision was no doubt made more difficult as party strife multiplied. 
In late 1957 the M&P& (<Mouvement Populaire>) appeared 
and in the spring of 1958 the internal strains of the Istiqlal was 
revealed when the third Council of Government under Balafrej was formed 
without support from progressive elements in the party. The parties 
were on the whole unprepared for elections, while the people were 
still experiencing post-independence let-down and suffering the after 
effects of poor harvests in 1957.   Despite the internal and international 
crises that harassed Morocco the elections remained a central 
issue. They figured prominently in the Balafrej government of May, 
1958, which the King was reportedly determined to keep in office until 
elections could be held. But the eagerly sought "homogeneity" 
of the Balafrej Council of Government was never achieved as the Istiqlal 
quarreled over foreign policy, labor politics and economic development. 
By December, 1958, when 'Abdallah Ibrahim became President 
of the Council, elections had even greater importance. They were 
increasingly looked upon as a means of establishing the new rural 
communes as the focus of a new, constructive national effort. To minimize 
the chances of repeating the Balafrej debacle the Ibrahim government 
was formed <a titre personnel> and a special office was created 
in the Ministry of the Interior to plan and to conduct the elections. 
By this time there is little doubt but what election plans were complete. 
There remained only the delicate task of maneuvering the laws 
through the labyrinth of Palace politics and making a small number 
of 
policy decisions.   From the rather tortuous history of electoral 
planning in Morocco an important point emerges concerning the first 
elections in a developing country and evaluating their results. In 
the new country the electoral process is considered as a means of resolving 
fundamental, and sometimes bitter, differences among leaders and 
also as a source of policy guidance. In the absence of a reservoir 
of political consensus each organized political group hopes that the elections 
will give them new prominence, but in a system where there is 
as yet no place for the less prominent. Lacking the respected and effective 
institutions that consensus helps provide, minority parties, such 
as the P&D&I& in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction 
in 1958, clamor for elections when out of power, but are not at all 
certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice when in power. Those 
in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral 
process. The tendency to treat elections as an instrument of self-interest 
rather than an instrument of national interest had two important 
effects 
on electoral planning in Morocco.   At the central level 
the <scrutin uninominal> voting system was selected over some form 
of the <scrutin de liste> system, even though the latter had been 
recommended by Duverger and favored by all political parties. The 
choice of the single member district was dictated to a certain extent 
by problems of communication and understanding in the more remote areas 
of the country, but it also served to minimize the national political 
value of the elections. Although the elections were for local officials, 
it was not necessary to conduct the elections so as to prevent parties 
from publicly identifying their candidates. With multiple member 
districts the still fragmentary local party organizations could have 
operated more effectively and parties might have been encouraged to 
state their positions more clearly. Both parties and the Ministry of 
the Interior were busily at work after the elections trying to unearth 
the political affiliations of the successful candidates and, thereby, 
give the elections a confidential but known degree of national political 
significance. Since a national interpretation cannot be avoided 
it is unfortunate that the elections were not held in a way to maximize 
party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation.

The general setting of the Moroccan election may 
also encourage the deterioration of local party organization. The concentration 
of effective power in Rabat leads not only to party bickering, 
but to distraction from local activity that might have had many 
auxiliary benefits in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections. 
Interesting evidence can be found in the results of the Chamber 
of Commerce elections, which took place three weeks before national 
elections. The Istiqlal sponsored U&M&C&I&A& (<L'Union 
Marocaine des Commercants, Industrialistes et Artisans>) 
was opposed by candidates of the new U&N&F&P& (<L'Union 
National des Forces Populaires>) in nearly all urban centers. 
As the more conservative group with strong backing from wealthy 
businessmen, the U&M&C&I&A& was generally favored 
against the more progressive, labor-based U&N&F&P& The 
newer party campaigned heavily, while the older, more confident party 
expected the Moroccan merchants and small businessmen to support them 
as they had done for many years. The local Istiqlal and U&M&C&I&A& 
offices did not campaign and lost heavily. The 
value of the elections was lost, both as an experiment in increased political 
participation and as a reliable indicator of commercial interest, 
as shown in Table /1,.   The chamber of Commerce elections 
were, of course, an important event in the preparation for rural commune 
elections. The U&N&F&P& learned that its urban organization, 
which depends heavily on U&M&T& support, was most 
effective. The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity of 
the independence struggle was not easily transposed to the more concrete, 
precise problems of internal politics. The overall effect was probably 
to stimulate more party activity in the communal elections than 
might have otherwise taken place.   A second major point of this 
essay is to examine the formal arrangements for the elections. Although 
a somewhat technical subject, it has important political implications 
as the above discussion of the voting system indicated. Furthermore, 
the problems and solutions devised in the electoral experiences of 
the rapidly changing countries are often of comparative value and essential 
to evaluating election results. The <sine qua non> of the elections 
was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure. As the 
background discussion indicated there were frequently expressed doubts
