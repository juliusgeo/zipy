the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that is used in its production. 
Originally, the main types used were various compositions of polyesters. 
These are still in wide use today, particularly in semi-rigid 
formulations, for such applications as cores for sandwich-type structural 
panels, foamed-in-place insulation, automotive safety padding, arm 
rests, etc&. More recently, polyethers- again in varied compositions, 
molecular weights, and branching- have come into use at first 
for the flexible foams, just lately for the rigids. The polyether glycols 
are claimed to give flexible urethanes a spring-back action which 
is much desired in cushioning.   Although the first polyether foams 
on the market had to be produced by the two-step prepolymer method, 
today, thanks to new catalysts, they can be produced by a one-shot 
technique. It is possible that the polyether foams may soon be molded 
on a production basis in low-cost molds with more intricate contours 
and with superior properties to latex foam.   The polyester urethane 
foam is generally produced with adipic acid polyesters; the polyether 
group generally consists of foams produced with polypropylene glycol 
or polypropylene glycol modified with a triol. _ONE SHOT VS& 
PREPOLYMER_ In the prepolymer system, the isocyanate and resin are 
mixed anhydrously and no foaming occurs. The foaming can be accomplished 
at some future time at a different location by the addition of the 
correct proportion of catalyst in solution. In one-shot, the isocyanate, 
polyester or polyether resin, catalyst, and other additives are 
mixed directly and a foam is produced immediately. Basically, this means 
that simpler processing equipment (the mixture has good flowing characteristics) 
and less external heat (the foaming reaction is exothermic 
and develops internal heat) are required in one-shot foaming, although, 
at the same time, the problems of controlling the conditions of 
one-shot foaming are critical ones. _PROPERTIES_ Most commercial 
uses of urethane foams require densities between 2 and 30 lb&/cu& 
ft& for rigid foams, between 1 and 3 lb&/cu& ft& for flexible 
foams. This latter figure compares with latex foam rubber at an average 
of 5.5 lb&/cu& ft& in commercial grades. _COMPRESSION STRENGTH:_ 
Graph in Fig& 1, p& 392, indicates how the ratio of 
compressive strength to density varies as the latter is increased or 
decreased. The single curve line represents a specific formulation in 
a test example. By varying the formula, this curve may be moved forward 
or backward along the coordinates to produce any desired compression 
strength/density ratio. _THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY AND TEMPERATURE RESISTANCE:_ 
In flexible urethane foams, we are referring to the range 
between the highest and lowest temperatures under which the materials' 
primary performance remains functionally useful. In temperature 
resistance, this quality is usually related to specific properties, 
e&g&, flexural, tensile strengths, etc&. Thermal conductivity is 
directly traceable to the material's porous, air-cell construction 
which effectively traps air or a gas in the maze of minute bubbles which 
forms its composition. These air or gas bubbles make highly functional 
thermal barriers. The ~K factor, a term used to denote the rate 
of heat transmission through a material (B&t&u&/sq& ft& 
of material/hr&/`F&/in& of thickness) ranges from 0.24 to 0.28 
for flexible urethane foams and from 0.12 to 0.16 for rigid urethane 
foams, depending upon the formulation, density, cell size, and nature 
of blowing agents used. Table /1,, p& 394, shows a comparison of 
~K factor ratings of a number of commercial insulating materials 
in common use, including two different types of rigid urethane foam. _FLEXURAL 
STRENGTH:_ This term refers to the ability of a material 
to resist bending stress and is determined by measuring the load required 
to cause failure by bending. The higher-density urethane semi-rigid 
foams usually have stronger flex fatigue resistance, i&e&, the 
12 lb&/cu& ft& foam has 8 times the flexural strength of the 
3 lb&/cu& ft& density. Note that flexural strength is not always 
improved by simply increasing the density, nor is the change always 
proportional from one formulation to another. Where flexural strength 
is an important factor, be sure that your urethane foam processor is 
aware of it. _TENSILE STRENGTH:_ This property refers to the greatest 
longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tearing 
apart. Like compression strength of urethane foams, it has a direct 
relationship to formulation. Exceptional tensile strength is another 
of urethane foam's strong features. Figure 2, above, shows the 
aging properties of urethane foams as determined by the percent of change 
in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet light. _PROCESSING 
URETHANES_ There are many ways of producing a foamed urethane 
product. The foam can be made into slab stock and cut to shape, it 
can be molded, it can be poured-in-place, it can be applied by spray 
guns, etc&.   Slab stock is still one of the most important forms 
of urethane end-product in use today. Basically, the foam machines 
that produce such stock consist of two or more pumping units, a variable 
mixer, a nozzle carriage assembly, and, in many cases, a conveyor 
belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process 
and until it solidifies into foam. The ingredients are fed from tanks 
through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermined rate. The mixing 
head moves back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle. 
It only takes a few minutes for the foaming action to be completed 
and after a short cure, the material can be cut into lengths as desired.

Much has been done in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate 
the slab stock into finished products. Profile cutting machines 
are available which can split foam to any desired thickness and produce 
sine, triangle, trapezoid, and other profiles in variable heights, 
dimensions, etc&. The convoluted sheets can be combined to attain 
certain cushioning effects mechanically rather than chemically. Also 
available is a slitter which "peels" the inside of a folded block 
of foam and can be used to slit continuous sheets up to 300 yd& in 
length, down to 1/16 in& thick.   The low cost and ease of fabrication 
of the dies for three-dimensional foam cutting plus the wide 
variety of shapes, dimensions, and contours that can be tailor-made to 
customer requirements has made the technique useful for producing case 
liners, materials handling containers, packaging and cushioning devices, 
and such novelties as soap dishes, toys, head rests, arch supports, 
and gas pedal covers. _MOLDING_ Although slab stock appeared 
first, it soon became apparent that for the production of cushions with 
irregular shapes, crowned contours, or rounded edges, the cutting of 
slab stock is a wasteful and uneconomical process. Only by resorting 
to molding techniques can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily 
in the established cushion market.   The closed molding 
of flexible urethane foams has been a problem ever since the introduction 
of the material (molding in open molds was more feasible). 
Satisfactory methods for polyester foams and even prepolymer polyether 
foams were never fully achieved. Closed molding generally resulted 
in parts weighing more (because of higher density) than parts fabricated 
from free-blown foams. This counteracted the gain from having no scrap 
loss. In addition, there were difficulties with the flow and spreading 
of the foam mixture over the mold surface, trouble with lack of 
gel strength in the rising foam, and problems of splits. The introduction 
of one-shot polyether foam systems, aided by the development of 
new catalysts, helped to alleviate some of the problems of closed molding. 
While there are still many bugs to be ironed out, the technique 
is fast developing. _OTHER TECHNIQUES_ Simple systems are available 
that make it possible for urethane foam components to be poured, pumped, 
etc&, into a void where they foam up to fill the void. In a 
typical application- the making of rigid urethane foam sandwich panels- 
an amount of foam mixture calculated to expand 10 to 20% more 
than the volume of the panel is poured into the panel void and the top 
of the panel is locked in place by a jig. 
Temperature of the wash and rinse waters is maintained at 85-90`F& 
(29-32`C&). The top rolls are loaded with 40 lbs&. Sixty 
lbs& loading is possible but 40 lbs& is adequate.   The suds 
box drain is arranged at the start to deliver into the raised main drain 
pipe (thus returning suds to soap box) and the machine is started. 
The 160-ml& bath containing the calculated amount of detergent is 
applied slowly and directly to the running specimen. Washing is continued 
for 30 minutes or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nips 
or passes through the squeeze rolls. At the conclusion of the washing, 
8 liters of water at 90`F& (32`C&) are automatically metered 
from the rinse reservoir to the washing tubs, 4 liters to each tub. 
This operation requires from 10 to 12 minutes. During the rinsing 
operation the volume in the tubs gradually increases until overflow 
from the main drain begins. At this point the drains are readjusted so 
that the suds box drain will discharge directly into the waste line 
and the main tub drain is set at the 2-1/2 mark on the drain gauge. When 
all of the rinse water has passed from the reservoir to the tubs the 
main drains are lowered to permit complete draining of the tubs. The 
run is complete when all the water has drained off into the waste line.

By this procedure rinsing progresses in two stages, first 
by dilution until the time when the drains are separated and thereafter 
by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water, since 
soiled liquor squeezed from the specimens at the nip passes directly 
to waste from the suds box drains. This method of rinsing appears 
to produce maximum cleansing with minimum soil redeposition. 

#SUGGESTED 
EVALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION#

Evaluation may be made on 
either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis as desired. A 
reflectance-measuring 
instrument may be desirable to measure cleaning, whereas 
Soxhlet extraction is necessary to measure grease removal. 

#PURPOSE AND SCOPE#

This test method is intended for determining 
the dimensional changes of woven or knitted fabrics, made of fibers other 
than wool, to be expected when the cloth is subjected to laundering 
procedures commonly used in the commercial laundry and the home. Four 
washing test procedures are established, varying in severity from very 
severe to very mild, and are intended to cover the range of practical 
washing from commercial procedure to hand washing. Five drying test 
procedures are established to cover the range of drying techniques 
used in the home and commercial laundry. Three methods for determining 
the dimensional restorability characteristics are established for those 
textiles which require restoration by ironing or wearing after laundering. 
These tests are not accelerated and must be repeated to evaluate 
dimensional changes after repeated launderings.   Table /1, 
summarizes all of the various washing, drying, and restoration procedures 
available. The person using these tests must determine which combination 
of procedures is practical for any specific item in order to 
evaluate the dimensional changes of textile fabrics or garments after 
laundering procedures commonly used in the home or commercial laundry. 
It is possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code 
consisting of a Roman Numeral, a letter, and an Arabic number. For 
example Test /3, ~E 1 refers to a specimen which has been washed 
by procedure "/3," (at 160`F& for a total of 60 minutes 
in the machine, has been dried in a tumble dryer by procedure "~E" 
and has been subjected to restorative forces on the Tension 
Presser by procedure "1". 

#PRINCIPLE#

A specimen or garment 
is washed in a cylindrical reversing wash wheel, dried and subjected 
to restorative forces where necessary. Temperature and time of agitation 
in the wash wheel are varied to obtain different degrees of severity. 
Drying procedures and application of restorative force procedures 
are varied to conform with end-use handling during home or commercial 
laundering. Distances marked on the specimen in warp and filling 
directions (or wales and courses for knitted fabrics) are measured before 
and after laundering.
