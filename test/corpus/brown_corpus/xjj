Some people thought he lacked both ability and character, but 
most 
agreed that he was noble in appearance and, for a Russian, humane. 
The Marshal came to know Littlepage quite well. At General Headquarters 
the newcomer in turn got to know others. There was the Neapolitan, 
Ribas, a capable conniver whose father had been a blacksmith 
but who had fawned his way up the ladder of Catherine's and Potemkin's 
favor till he was now a brigadier (and would one day be the daggerman 
designated to do in Czar Paul /1,, after traveling all the 
way 
to Naples to procure just the right stiletto).   Then there were 
the distinguished foreign volunteers. Representing the Emperor were 
the Prince de Ligne, still as impetuous as a youth of twenty; and 
General the Count Pallavicini, founder of the Austrian branch of 
that celebrated Italian house, a courtier Littlepage could have met 
at Madrid in December, 1780. From Milan came the young Chevalier 
de Litta, an officer in the service of Malta. Out of Saxony rode 
the Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg, one of the Czarina's cousins and 
a lieutenant general in her armies, a frank, sensitive, popular soldier 
whose kindnesses Littlepage would "always recall with the sincerest 
gratitude".   Though Catherine was vexed at the number of 
French officers streaming to the Turkish standard, there were several 
under her own, such as the Prince de Nassau; the energetic Parisian, 
Roger de Damas, three year's Littlepage's junior, to whom 
Nassau had taken a liking; and the artillerist, Colonel Prevost, 
whom the Count de Segur had persuaded to lend his technical skills 
to Nassau. England contributed a young subaltern named Newton and 
the naval architect Samuel Bentham, brother to the economist, who far 
his colonel's commission was proving a godsend to the Russian fleet. 
From America were the Messrs& Littlepage and Jones. 
Lewis had expected to report at once to Jones's and Nassau's naval 
command post. On arrival at headquarters he had, however- in King 
Stanislas' words to Glayre- "found such favor with ~Pe 
Potemkin that he made him his aide-de-camp and up to now does not want 
him to go join Paul Jones **h". So of course he stayed put. Having 
done so, he began to experience all the frustrations of others who 
attempted to get along with Serenissimus and do a job at the same 
time.   The Prince's perceptions were quick and his energy monstrous, 
but these qualities were sapped by an Oriental lethargy and 
a policy of letting nothing interfere with personal passions. At headquarters- 
sufficiently far from the firing line to make you forget occasionally 
that you were in a war- Lewis found that the Commander 
in Chief's only desk was his knees (and his only comb, his fingers). 
An entire theater had been set up for his diversion, with a 200-man 
Italian orchestra under the well-known Sarti. In the great one's 
personal quarters, a portable house, almost every evening saw an elegant 
banquet or reception. Lewis could let his eye caress The Prince's 
divan, covered with a rose-pink and silver Turkish cloth, or admire 
the lovely tapis, interwoven with gold, that spread across the floor. 
Filigreed perfume boxes exuded the aromas of Araby. Around the 
billiard tables were always at least a couple of dozen beribboned generals. 
At dinner the courses were carried in by tall cuirassiers in red 
capes and black fur caps topped with tufts of feathers, marching in 
pairs like guards from a stage tragedy.   Among the visitors arriving 
every now and then there were, of course, women. For if Serenissimus 
made the sign of the Cross with his right hand, and meant it, 
with his left he beckoned lewdly to any lady who happened to catch his 
eye. Usually Lewis would find at headquarters one or more of The 
Prince's various nieces.   Right now he found Sophie de Witt, 
that magnificent young matron he had spotted at Kamieniec fours years 
ago. The Prince took her with him on every tour around the area, 
and it was rumored he was utilizing her knowledge of Constantinople 
as part of his espionage network. One evening he passed around the banquet 
table a crystal cup full of diamonds, requesting every female guest 
to select one as a souvenir. When a lady chanced to soil a pair of 
evening slippers, Brigadier Bauer was dispatched to Paris for replacements.

But if The Prince fancied women and was fascinated 
by foreigners, he could be haughtiness personified to his subordinates. 
He had collared one of his generals in public. His coat trimmed 
in sable, diamond stars of the Orders of Saints Andrew or George agleam, 
he was often prone to sit sulkily, eye downcast, in a Scheherazade 
trance. When this happened, everything stopped. As Littlepage 
noted: "A complete picture of Prince Potemkin may be had in his 
1788 operations. He stays inactive for half the summer in front of Oczakov, 
a quite second-rate spot, begins to besiege it <formally> only 
during the autumn rains, and finally carries it <by assault> in 
the heart of winter. There's a man who never goes by the ordinary road 
but still arrives at his goal, who gratuitously gets himself into 
difficulty in order to get out of it with eclat, in a word a man who creates 
monsters for himself in order to appear a <Hercules> in destroying 
them".   To help him do so The Prince had conferred control 
of his land forces on a soldier who was different from him in almost 
every respect save one: both were eccentrics of the purest ray 
serene.   Alexander Vasilievitch Suvorov, now in his fifty-ninth 
year (ten years Potemkin's senior), was a thin, worn-faced person 
of less than medium height who looked like a professor of botany. He 
had a small mouth with deep furrows on either side, a large flat nose, 
and penetrating blue eyes. His gray hair was thin, his face beginning 
to attract a swarm of wrinkles. He was ugly. But Suvorov's face 
was also a theater of vivacity, and his tough, stooping little frame 
was briskness embodied. Like all Russians he was an emotional man, 
and in him the emotions warred. Kind by nature, he never refused charity 
to a beggar or help to anyone who asked him for it (as Lewis would 
one day discover). But he was perpetually engaged in a battle to 
command his own temper.   When Littlepage was introduced, if the 
General behaved as usual, the newcomer faced a staccato salvo of queries: 
origin? age? mission? current status? Woe betide the 
interviewee if he answered vaguely. Suvorov's contempt for don't-know's 
was proverbial; better to give an asinine answer than none 
at all. Despising luxuries of any sort for a soldier, he slept on a 
pile of hay with his cloak as blanket. He rose at 4:00 A&M& the 
year round and 
was apt to stride through camp crowing like a cock to wake 
his men. His breakfast was tea; his dinner fell anywhere from nine 
to noon; his supper was nothing. He hadn't worn a watch or carried 
pocket money for years because he disliked both, but highest among 
his hates were looking glasses: he had snatched one from an officer's 
grasp and smashed it to smithereens. He kept several pet birds 
and liked cats well enough that if one crept by, he would mew at it in 
friendly fashion. Passing dogs were greeted with a cordial bark.

Yet General Suvorov- who had never forgotten hearing his adored 
Czarina declare that all truly great men had oddities- was mad 
only north, northwest. He had come to learn that a reputation for peculiarity 
allowed mere field officers a certain leeway at Court; in 
camp he knew it won you the affection of your men. He had accordingly 
cultivated eccentricity to the point of second nature. Underneath, he 
remained one of the best-educated Russians of his day. He dabbled 
in verse, could get along well among most of the European languages, 
and was fluent in French and German. He had also mastered the Cossack 
tongue.   For those little men with the short whiskers, shaven 
polls, and top knots Suvorov reserved a special esteem. Potemkin- 
as King Stanislas knew, and presently informed Littlepage- looked 
on the Cossacks as geopolitical tools. To Serenissimus such tribes 
as the Cossacks of the Don or those ex-bandits the Zaporogian 
Cossacks 
(in whose islands along the lower Dnieper the Polish novelist 
Sienkiewicz would one day place <With Fire and Sword>) were just 
elements for enforced resettlement in, say, Bessarabia, where, as 
"the faithful of the Black Sea borders", he could use their presence 
as baragining points in the Czarina's territorial claims against 
Turkey. Suvorov saw in these scimitar-wielding skirmishers not demographic 
units but military men of a high potential. He knew how to 
channel their exuberant disorderliness so as to transform them from mere 
plunderers into A-1 guerrilla 
fighters. He always kept a few on his 
personal staff. He often donned their tribal costumes, such as the 
one featuring a tall, black sheepskin hat from the top of which dangled 
a little red bag ornamented by a chain of worsted lace and tassels; 
broad red stripes down the trouser leg; broader leather belt round 
the waist, holding cartridges and light sabre. Suvorov played parent 
not just to his Cossacks but to all his troops. It was probably at 
this period that Littlepage got his first good look at the ordinary 
Russian soldier.   These illiterate boors conscripted from villages 
all across the Czarina's empire had, Suvorov may have told Lewis, 
just two things a commander could count on: physical fitness and 
personal courage. When their levies came shambling into camp, they 
were all elbows, hair, and beard. They emerged as interchangeable cogs 
in a faulty but formidable machine: shaved nearly naked, hair queued, 
greatcoated, jackbooted, and best of all- in the opinion of the 
British professional, Major Semple-Lisle- "their minds are not 
estranged from the paths of obedience by those smatterings of knowledge 
which only serve to lead to insubordination and mutiny". 
Mando, pleading her cause, must have said that Dr& Brown was the 
most distinguished physician in the United States of America, for 
our man poured out his symptoms and drew a madly waving line indicating 
the irregularity of his pulse. "He's got high blood pressure, too, 
and bum kidneys", the doctor said to me. "Transparent look, waxy 
skin- could well be uremia". He looked disapprovingly at an ash 
tray piled high with cigarette stubs, shook his head, and moved his 
hand back and forth in a strong negative gesture. The little official 
hung his head in shame. Seeing this, his colleague at the next desk 
gave a short, contemptuous laugh, pushed forward his own ash tray, innocent 
of a single butt, thumped his chest to show his excellent condition, 
and looked proud. The doctor gravely nodded approval.

At this moment Mando came hurrying up to announce that the problem 
was solved and all Norton had to do was to sign a sheaf of papers. We 
went out of the office and down the hall to a window where documents 
and more officials awaited us, the rest of the office personnel hot 
upon our heels. By this time word had got around that an American doctor 
was on the premises. One fellow who had liver spots held out his 
hands to the great healer. It was funny but it was also touching. "You 
know", Norton said to me later, "I am thinking of setting 
up the Klinico Brownapopolus. I might not make any money but I'd 
sure have patients".   After luncheon we took advantage of 
the siesta period to try to get in touch with a few people to whom our 
dear friend Deppy had written. Deppy is Despina Messinesi, a long-time 
member of the <Vogue> staff who, although born in Boston, was 
born there 
of Greek parents. Several years of her life have been spent in 
the homeland, and she had written to friends to alert them of our coming. 
"All you have to do, Ilka dear, is to phone on your arrival. 
They are longing to see you". The wear and tear of life have taught 
me that very few friends of mutual friends long to see foreign strangers, 
but I planned on being the soul of tact, of giving them plenty 
of outs was there the tiniest implication that their cups were already 
running over without us. My diplomacy was needless. Greek phone service 
is worse than French, so that it was to be some little time before 
contact of any sort was established.   In the late afternoon 
Mando came back to fetch us, and we drove to the Acropolis. We stopped 
first at the amphitheater that lies at the foot of the height crowned 
by the Parthenon. The curving benches are broken, chipped, tumbled, 
but still in place, as are the marble chairs, the seats of honor 
for the legislators. The carved statues of the frieze against the low 
wall are for the most part headless, but their exquisitely graceful nude 
and draped torsos and the kneeling Atlantes are well preserved in 
their perfect proportion.   Having completed our camera work, we 
started our climb. I suppose the same emotion holds, if to a lesser
