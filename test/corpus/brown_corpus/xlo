(transpiration cooling) not only feeds back the energy transferred 
to the anode by the above mentioned processes, but also modifies the conditions 
in the arc itself. A detailed study of this latter phenomenon 
was not attempted in this paper. Argon was used as a blowing gas to 
exclude any effects of dissociation or chemical reaction. The anode 
material was porous graphite. Sintered porous metals should be usable 
in principle. However, technical difficulties arise by melting at local 
hot spots. The experimental arrangement as described below is based 
on the geometry of free burning arcs. Thus, direct comparisons can 
be drawn with free burning arcs which have been studied in detail during 
the past years and decades by numerous investigators (Ref& 3). 

#EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS#

Figures 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic 
views of the test stand and of two different models of the anode 
holder. The cathode consisted of a 1/4'' diameter thoriated tungsten 
rod attached to a water cooled copper tube. This tube could be 
adjusted in its axial direction by an electric drive to establish the 
required electrode spacing. The anode in figure 2 was mounted by means 
of the anode holder which was attached to a steel plug and disk. The 
transpiring gas ejected from the anode formed a jet directed axially 
towards the cathode below. Inflow of air from the surrounding atmosphere 
was prevented by the two disks shown in figure 2. Argon was also 
blown at low velocities (mass flow rate **f) through a tube coaxial 
with 
the cathode as an additional precaution against contamination of the 
arc by air. The anode consisted of a 1/2 inch diameter porous graphite 
plug, 1/4 inch long. The graphite was National Carbon ~NC 
60, which has a porosity of 50% and an average pore size of 30 This 
small pore size was required to ensure uniformity of the flow leaving 
the anode. The anode plug (Figure 2) was inserted into a carbon 
anode holder. A shielded thermocouple was used to measure the upstream 
temperature of the transpiring gas. It was exposed to a high velocity 
gas jet. A plug and a tube with holes in its cylindrical walls divided 
the chamber above the porous plug into two parts. This arrangement 
had the purpose to prevent heated gas to reach the thermocouple by 
natural convection. Two pyrometers shown in figure 1 and 2 (Pyrometer 
Instrument Co& Model 95) served for simultaneous measurement of 
the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along 
the anode holder. Three thermocouples were placed at different locations 
in the aluminum disk surrounding the anode holder to determine its 
temperature.   Another anode holder used in the experiments is shown 
in figure 3. In this design the anode holder is water cooled and 
the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring 
the temperature rise of the coolant. To reduce heat transfer from 
the hot has to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc, a carbon 
shield was attached tothe surface providing an air gap of 1/16 
inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder. In addition, 
the inner surface of the carbon shield was covered with aluminum foil 
to reduce radiation. Temperatures of the shield and of the surface 
of the water-cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account 
for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode 
plug.   The argon flow from commercial bottles was regulated 
by a pressure regulator and measured with a gas flow rator. The power 
source was a commercial D& C& rectifier. At 100 ~Amp the 
360 cycle ripple was less than 0.5 ~V (peak to peak) with a resistive 
load. The current was regulated by means of a variable resistor and 
measured with a 50 ~mV shunt and millivoltmeter. The arc voltage 
was measured with a voltmeter whose terminals were connected to the anode 
and cathode holders. Because of the falling characteristic of the 
rectifier, no ballast resistor was required for stability of operation. 
A high frequency starter was used to start the arc. 

#EXPERIMENTAL 
PROCEDURE AND ERROR ANALYSIS#

_1. TRANSPIRATION COOLED ANODE WITH 
CARBON ANODE HOLDER_ The anode holder shown in figure 2 was designed 
with two goals in mind. The heat losses of the holder were to be reduced 
as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat 
balance can be made. In order to reduce the number of variable parameters, 
all experiments were made with a constant arc length of 0.5'' 
and a current of 100 ~Amp. The argon flow through the porous anode 
was varied systematically between **f. and **f. The lower limit 
was determined by the fact that for smaller flow rates the arc started 
to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug 
and that it became highly unstable. The upper limit was determined by 
the difficulty of measuring the characteristic anode surface temperature 
(see below) since only a small region of the anode was struck by the 
arc. This region which had a higher temperature than the rest of the 
anode surface changed size and location continuously.   For each 
mass flow rate the arc voltage was measured. To measure the surface 
temperature of the anode plug, the surface was scanned with a pyrometer. 
As it turned out, a very hot region occurred on the plug. Its temperature 
was denoted by **f. The size of this hot region was estimated 
by eye. The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards 
the outer diameter of the plug. The mean temperature of this region 
was approximated by the temperature measured halfways between the 
edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug. It was denoted by **f. 
The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to 
the following relation: **f where ~x is the fraction of the plug area 
covered by the hot spot. Assuming thermal equilibrium between the 
anode surface and the transpiring argon, the gas enthalpy rise through 
the anode was calculated according to the relation **f whereby the specific 
heat of argon was taken as **f. This calculation results in 
an 
enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally 
distributed over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass 
velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures.

The upstream gas temperature measured with the thermocouple 
shown in figure 2 was **f. The **f values are listed in Table 1 
together 
with the measured surface temperatures and arc voltages. Simultaneously 
with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer 
readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode 
holder as indicated on figure 2. Some of these temperatures are plotted 
in figure 4. They showed no marked dependence on the flow rate 
within the accuracy of these measurements. Thus, the dotted line shown 
in figure 4 was taken as typical for the temperature distribution for 
all blowing rates.   The thermocouples in the aluminum disk shown 
in figure 2 indicated an equilibrium temperature of the surface of 
**f. This temperature was taken as environmental temperature to which 
the anode holder was exposed as far as radiation is concerned. It 
is sufficiently small compared with the surface temperature of the anode 
holder, to make the energy flux radiated from the environment toward 
the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurements. 
The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder 
and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also 
be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces 
and of the specific geometry. The total heat loss through the anode 
holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical 
piece into the adjacent metal parts. It was calculated from the 
temperature gradient **f at **f inch as **f. The total heat flux from 
the porous plug into the plug holder is thereby **f The temperature 
distribution of figure 4 gives **f for all blowing rates, assuming **f. 
The temperature dependent value of ~|e was taken from Ref& 
7. The radiation loss from the anode surface was computed according to 
**f where **f is the mean of the fourth powers of the temperatures **f 
and **f calculated analogously to equation (1).

A band viscometer is shown in Figure 2. It consists of two blocks 
with flat surfaces held apart by shims. There is a small well in 
the top in which the fluid or paste to be tested is placed. A tape 
of cellulose acetate is pulled between the blocks and the tape pulls the 
fluid or paste with it between the parallel faces of the blocks. In 
normal use weights are hung on the end of the tape and allowed to pull 
the tape and the material to be tested between the blocks. After it 
has reached terminal velocity, the time for the tape to travel a known 
distance is recorded. By the use of various weights, data for a force-rate 
of shear graph can be obtained. The instrument used for this 
work was a slight modification of that previously described.   In 
this test a **f tape was pulled between the blocks with a motor and 
pulley at a rate of **f with a clearance of 0.002'' on each side of 
the tape. This gives a rate of shear of **f. This, however, can only 
be considered 
approximate, as the diameter of the pulley was increased by the 
build-up of tape and the tape was occasionally removed from the pulley 
during the runs. The face of one block contained a hole 1/16'' 
in diameter which led to a 
manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure.   Although 
there were only four fluids tested, it was apparent that there were 
two distinct types. Two of the fluids showed a high-positive normal pressure 
when undergoing shear, and two showed small negative pressures 
which were negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressures 
generated by the other two.   Figure 3 shows the data on 
a silicone fluid, labeled 12,500 ~cps which gave a high positive normal 
pressure. Although the tape was run for over 1 hr&, a steady 
state was not reached, and it was concluded that the reason for this was 
that the back pressure of the manometer was built up from the material 
fed from between the blocks and this was available at a very slow 
rate. A system had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding of 
the fluid into the manometer if measurements of the normal pressure 
were to be made in a reasonable time. A back pressure was then introduced, 
and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicated 
which was greater, the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure. 
By this method it was determined that the normal pressure exerted 
by a sample of polybutene (molecular weight reported to be 770) was 
over half an atmosphere. The actual pressure was not determined because 
the pressure was beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand.

The two fluids which gave the small negative pressures were polybutenes 
with molecular weights which were stated to be 520 and 300. 
These are fluids which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more 
Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight. The maximum suction 
was 3.25'' of test fluid measured from the top of the block, 
and steady states were apparently reached with these fluids. It is presumed 
that this negative head was associated with some geometric factor 
of the assembly, since different readings were obtained with the same 
fluid and the only apparent difference was the assembly and disassembly 
of the apparatus. This negative pressure is not explained by the 
velocity head **f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings 
by several magnitudes.   These experiments can be considered 
exploratory only. However, they do demonstrate the presence of large 
normal pressures in the presence of flat shear fields which were forecast 
by the theory in the first part of the paper. They also give information 
which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument 
for the measurement of the normal pressures. Such an instrument would 
be useful for the characterization of many commercial materials as well 
as theoretical studies. The elasticity as a parameter of fluids 
which 
is not subject to simple measurement at present, and it is a parameter 
which is probably varying in an unknown manner with many commercial 
materials. Such an instrument is expected to be especially useful 
if it could be used to measure the elasticity of heavy pastes such as 
printing inks, paints, adhesives, molten plastics, and bread dough, for 
the elasticity is related to those various properties termed "length", 
"shortness", "spinnability", etc&, which are usually judged 
by subjective methods at present.   The actual change **f
