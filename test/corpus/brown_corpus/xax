her eligible for parole, as one of his last acts in office.

Mrs& Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became 
her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934. It was when he 
attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place.

The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday 
and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman 
on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan& 
20.   The defendant, William L& Stickney /3, 23, of 
3211 Park pl&, Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless driving, also 
was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic 
school each Tuesday night for one month.   Stickney is a salesman 
for Plee-Zing, Inc&, 2544 Green Bay rd&, Evanston, a 
food brokerage and grocery chain firm, of which his father, William L& 
Jr&, is president.   Patrolman James F& Simms said 
he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart 
avenue at Central street.   At Jenks street, Simms said, 
the car skidded completely around, just missed two parked cars, and 
sped east in Jenks.   The car spun around again, Simms said, 
before Stickney could turn north in Prairie avenue, and then violated 
two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie. 

_ST& JOHNS, MICH&, APRIL 19._- A jury of seven men and five 
women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday 
in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs& Anna Hengesbach.   Pohl 
received the verdict without visible emotion. He returned to his cell 
in the county jail, where he has been held since his arrest last July, 
without a word to his court-appointed attorney, Jack Walker, or his 
guard. 

#STEPSON VINDICATED#

The verdict brought vindication to 
the dead woman's stepson, Vincent Hengesbach, 54, who was tried 
for the same crime in December, 1958, and released when the jury failed 
to reach a verdict. Mrs& Hengesbach was killed on Aug& 31, 1958.

Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since. When 
the verdict came in against his young neighbor, Hengesbach said:

"I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed. Still, 
I don't wish to appear happy at somebody's else's misfortune". 

#LIVES ON WELFARE#

Hengesbach, who has been living on welfare 
recently, said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by 
his grandfather in Westphalia, 27 miles southwest of here.   Hengesbach 
has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were 
burned down after his release in 1958.   Pohl confessed the 
arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area 
by State Police.   He also admitted killing Mrs& Hengesbach. 
However, the confession, which was the only evidence against him, 
was retracted before the trial. 

#CHARGES IN DOUBT#

Assistant Prosecutor 
Fred Lewis, who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases, 
said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending 
against Pohl.   Circuit Judge Paul R& Cash did not set 
a date for sentencing. Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison 
or probation.   Walker said he was considering filing a motion 
for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the 
weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial 
procedure. 

#LOCKED IN MOTEL#

A verdict against Pohl came at 4:05 
p&m& after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation. The jury, which 
was locked up in a motel overnight, was canvassed at the request of 
Walker after the verdict was announced.   The jury foreman, Mrs& 
Olive Heideman, of rural Elsie, said that a ballot was not even 
taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation 
was spent in going over the evidence.   She said the jurors agreed 
that Pohl's confession was valid.   The jury asked Judge 
Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first 
and second-degree murder and manslaughter.   The verdict came 
three hours later.   Some 30 spectators remained in the court during 
the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read. The trial had 
packed the large courtroom for more than a week.

A Sterling Township family of six surviving children, whose 
mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one 
of the children, found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors 
and school friends.   While neighbor women assumed some of the 
dead mother's duties, fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners 
association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski 
family, 34220 Viceroy.   Mrs& Eleanor Kowalski, 42, 
died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered 
in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the 
flat of her widowed mother, Mrs& Mary Pankowski, in the adjoining 
suburb of Warren. 

#SERVICES TOMORROW#

Funeral services for Mrs& 
Kowalski and her daughter, Christine, 11, who died of burns at 
the same hospital Monday, have been scheduled for 10 a&m& tomorrow 
in St& Anne's Catholic Church, 31978 Mound, in Warren.

The 
mother and daughter, who will be buried side by side in Mt& Olivet 
Cemetery, rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott 
Funeral Home, 31730 Mound, Warren.   Mrs& Pankowski, 
61, remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion, 
which occurred while Mrs& Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's 
small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile road east. 

#HELD 
CANDLE#

Assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes 
apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski 
girls present held for her mother, because the flat lacked electricity.

Christine's twin sister, Patricia, and Darlene Kowalski, 
8, escaped with minor burns. They are home now with the other Kowalski 
children, Vicky, 14; Dennis, 6; Eleanor, 2; and Bernardine, 
1.   "All we have left in the world is one another, and we 
must stay together the way Mother wanted", Kowalski said in telling 
his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon. 
Kowalski, a roofer who seldom worked last winter, already was in arrears 
on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered 
him with medical and funeral bills. #$135 DONATED#

Neighbor 
women, such as Mrs& Sidney Baker, 2269 Serra, Sterling Township, 
have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores 
with Kowalski's sister-in-law, Mrs& Anna Kowalski, 22111 
David, East Detroit.   Another neighbor, Mrs& Frank C& 
Smith, 2731 Pall Mall, Sterling Township, surprised Kowalski by 
coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the 
$400 funeral costs.   John C& Houghton, president of the Tareytown 
Acres Homeowners Association, followed that by announcing plans 
last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision 
on behalf of the Kowalski family. 

#STUDENTS HELP OUT#

Houghton 
said 6 p&m& Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes 
in the subdivision, which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 
Mile road east. He said contributions also could be mailed to Post 
Office Box 553, Warren Village Station.   Vicky Kowalski 
meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost 
$25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior 
High School, 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.   Principal 
Clayton W& Pohly said he would allow a further collection between 
classes today, and revealed that ~Y-Teen Club past surpluses had 
been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs& Kowalski. 

#FUNDS FROM DANCES#

Student Council officers announced 
today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from 
a school dance held two weeks ago, and another dance for Fuhrmann's 
770 students this Friday night.   "Furhmann's faculty is proud 
that this has been a spontaneous effort, started largely among the 
students themselves, because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for 
her entire family, Pohly said.   There also were reports of a 
collection at the County Line Elementary School, 3505o Dequindre, 
which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including 
Christine. 

#EXPRESSES THANKS#

Kowalski has spoken but 
little since the fire last Saturday. But today he wanted to make a public 
statement.   "I never knew there were such neighbors and 
friends around me and my family. I wasn't sure there were such people 
anywhere in the world. I'll need more than a single day to find 
the words to properly express my thanks to them".

An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police 
today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against 
a youthful motorist.   Patrolman George Kimmell, of McClellan 
Station, said he would recommend a special safety citation for 
Ralph Sisk, 9230 Vernor east, a third grader at the Scripps School, 
for his assistance in the case.   Kimmell said he and Ralph 
were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon 
when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the 
pedestrian crosswalk. 

#GETS CAR NUMBER#

Kimmell ordered the driver 
to back up, watched the children safely across and was approaching 
the car when it suddenly "took off at high speed", he said, narrowly 
missing him.   Commandeering a passing car, Kimmell pursued 
the fleeing vehicle, but lost it in traffic. Returning to the school 
crossing, the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized 
the driver, a neighbor, and had obtained the license number.   The 
motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees, 17, of 2433 McClellan, 
currently on probation and under court order not to drive.
