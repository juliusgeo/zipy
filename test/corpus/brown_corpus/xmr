patient's and his months of work together. one cannot assume, of course, 
that all these accumulated meanings were inherent in the stereotype 
at the beginning of the therapy, or at any one time later on when 
the stereotype was uttered; probably it is correct to think of it as 
a matter of a well-grooved, stereotyped mode of expression- and no, 
or but a few, other communicational grooves, as yet- being <there>, 
available for the patient's use, as newly-emerging emotions and 
ideas well up in him over the course of months. But it is true that the 
therapist can sense, when he hears this stereotype, that there are 
at this moment many emotional determinants at work in it, a blurred babel 
of indistinct voices which have yet to become clearly delineated from 
one another.   Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype- a 
"How are you now"? or an "I want to go home", or whatever- 
but a nonverbal one which reveals itself, gradually, as the condensed 
expression of more than one latent meaning. A hebephrenic man used 
to give a repetitious wave of his hand a number of times during his 
largely-silent 
hours with his therapist. When the therapist came to feel 
on sufficiently sure ground with him to ask him, "What is that, 
Bill- hello or farewell"?, the patient replied, "Both, Dearie- 
two in one".   Of all the possible forms of nonverbal expression, 
that which seems best to give release, and communicational expression, 
to complex and undifferentiated feelings is laughter. It is 
no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient, the most severely dedifferentiated 
of all schizophrenic patients, shows, as one of his characteristic 
symptoms, laughter- laughter which now makes one feel scorned 
or hated, which now makes one feel like weeping, or which now gives 
one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man's despair; and 
which, more often than all these, conveys a <welter> of feelings which 
could in no way be 
conveyed by any number of words, words which are so 
unlike this welter in being formed and discrete from one another. To 
a much less full extent, the hebephrenic person's belching or flatus 
has a comparable communicative function; in working with these patients 
the therapist eventually gets to do some at least private mulling 
over of the possible meaning of a belch, or the passage of flatus, 
not only because he is reduced to this for lack of anything else to analyze, 
but also because he learns that even these animal-like sounds constitute 
forms of communication in which, from time to time, quite different 
things are being said, long before the patient can become sufficiently 
aware of these, as distinct feelings and concepts, to say them 
in words.   As I have been intimating, in the schizophrenic- 
and perhaps also in the dreams of the neurotic; this is a question 
which I have no wish to take up- condensation is a phenomenon in which 
one finds not a condensed expression of various feelings and ideas 
which are, at an unconscious level, well sorted out, but rather a condensed 
expression of feelings and ideas which, even in the unconscious, 
have yet to become well differentiated from one another. Freeman, 
Cameron and McGhie, in their description of the disturbances of thinking 
found in chronic schizophrenic patients, say, in regard to condensation, 
that "**h the lack of adequate discrimination between the 
self and the environment, and the objects contained therein **h in itself 
is the prototypical condensation".   In my experience, a 
great many of the patient's more puzzling verbal communications are 
so for the reason that concrete meanings have not become differentiated 
from figurative meanings in his subjective experience. Thus he may 
be referring to some concrete thing, or incident, in his immediate environment 
by some symbolic-sounding, hyperbolic reference to transcendental 
events on the global scene. Recently, for example, a paranoid woman's 
large-scale philosophizing, in the session, about the intrusive 
curiosity which has become, in her opinion, a deplorable characteristic 
of mid-twentieth-century human culture, developed itself, before the 
end of the session, into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking 
at her partially exposed breast, as indeed I was. Or, equally 
often, a concretistic-seeming, particularistic-seeming statement may consist, 
with its mundane exterior, in a form of poetry- may be full 
of meaning and emotion when interpreted as a figurative expression: 
a metaphor, a smile, an allegory, or some other symbolic mode of speaking.

Of such hidden meanings the patient himself is, more often 
than not, entirely unaware. His subjective experience may be a remarkably 
concretistic one. One hebephrenic women confided to me, "I 
live in a world of words", as if, to her, words were fully concrete 
objects; Burnham, in his excellent article (1955) concerning schizophrenic 
communication, includes mention of similar clinical material. 
A borderline schizophrenic young man told me that to him the various 
theoretical concepts about which he had been expounding, in a most articulate 
fashion, during session after session with me, were like great 
cubes of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above him; as he 
spoke I was reminded of the great bales of cargo which are swung, high 
in the air, from a docked steamship.

The many linguistic techniques for reducing the amount of dictionary 
information that have been proposed all organize the dictionary's 
contents around prefixes, stems, suffixes, etc&. A significant 
reduction 
in the voume of store information is thus realized, especially 
for a highly inflected language such as Russian. For English the reduction 
in size is less striking. This approach requires that: (1) 
each text word be separated into smaller elements to establish a correspondence 
between the occurrence and dictionary entries, and (2) the information 
retrieved from several entries in the dictionary be synthesized 
into a description of the particular word. The logical scheme used 
to accomplish the former influences the placement of information in 
the dictionary file. Implementation of the latter requires storage of 
information needed only for synthesis.   We suggest the application 
of certain data-processing techniques as a solution to the problem. 
But first, we must define two terms so that their meaning will be 
clearly understood: _1._ <form>- any unique sequence of alphabetic 
characters that can appear in a language preceded and followed 
by a space. _2._ <occurrence>- an instance of a form in text.

We propose a method for selecting only dictionary information 
required by the text being translated and a means for passing the information 
directly to the occurrences in text. We accomplish this by compiling 
a list of text forms as text is read by the computer. A random-storage 
scheme, based on the spelling of forms, provides an economical 
way to compile this text-form list. Dictionary forms found to match 
forms in the text list are marked. A location in the computer store 
is also named for each marked form; dictionary information about the 
form stored at this location can be retrieved directly by occurrences 
of the form in text. Finally, information is retrieved from the dictionary 
as required by stages of the translation process- the grammatic 
description for sentence-structure determination, equivalent-choice 
information for semantic analysis, and target-language equivalents 
for output construction.   The dictionary is a form dictionary, 
at least in the sense that complete forms are used as the basis for matching 
text occurrences with dictionary entries. Also, the dictionary 
is divided into at least two parts: the list of dictionary forms and 
the file of information that pertains to these forms. A more detailed 
description of dictionary operations- text lookup and dictionary 
modification- give a clearer picture.   Text lookup, as we will 
describe it, consists of three steps. The first is compiling a list 
of text forms, assigning an information cell to each, and replacing text 
occurrences with the information cell assigned to the form of each 
occurrence. For this step the computer memory is separated into three 
regions: cells in the ~W-region are used for storage of the forms 
in the text-form list; cells in the ~X-region and ~Y region 
are reserved as information cells for text forms.   When an occurrence 
**f is isolated during text reading, a random memory address **f, 
the address of a cell in the ~X-region, is computed from the form 
of **f. Let **f denote the form of **f. If cell **f has not previously 
been assigned as the information cell of a form in the text-form 
list, it is now assigned as the information cell of **f. The form itself 
is stored in the next available cells of the ~W-region, beginning 
in cell **f. The address **f and the number of cells required to 
store the form are written in **f; the information cell **f is saved 
to represent the text occurrence. Text reading continues with the next 
occurrence.   Let us assume that **f is identical to the form 
of an occurrence **f which preceded **f in the text. When this situation 
exists, the address **f will equal **f which was produced from **f. 
If **f was assigned as the information cell for **f, the routine can 
detect that **f is identical to **f by comparing **f with the form 
stored at location **f. The address **f is stored in the cell **f. When, 
as in this case, the two forms match, the address **f is saved to 
represent the occurrence **f. Text reading continues with the next 
occurrence.

A third situation is possible. The formula for computing 
random addresses from the form of each occurrence will not give a 
distinct address for each distinct form. Thus, when more than one distinct 
form leads to a particular cell in the ~X-region, a chain of 
information cells must be created to accommodate the forms, one cell 
in the chain for each form. If **f leads to an address **f that is equal 
to the address computed from **f, even though **f does not match **f, 
the chain of information cells is extended from **f by storing the 
address of the next available cell in the ~Y-region, **f, in **f. 
The 
cell **f becomes the second information cell in the chain and is assigned 
as the information cell of **f. A third cell can be added by storing 
the address of another ~Y-cell in **f; similarly, as many cells 
are added as are required. Each information cell in the chain contains 
the address of the ~Y-cell where the form to which it is assigned 
is stored. Each cell except the last in the chain also contains 
the address of the ~Y-cell that is the next element of the chain; 
the absence of such a link in the last cell indicates the end of the 
chain. Hence, when the address **f is computed from **f, the cell **f 
and 
all ~Y-cells in its chain must be inspected to determine whether 
**f is already in the form list or whether it should be added to the form 
list and the chain. When the information cell for **f has been determined, 
it is saved as a representation of **f. Text reading continues 
with the next occurrence.   Text reading is terminated when 
a pre-determined number of forms have been stored in the text-form list. 
This initiates the second step of glossary lookup- connecting the 
information cell of forms in the text-form list to dictionary forms. 
Each form represented by the dictionary is looked up in the text-form 
list. Each time a dictionary form matches a text form, the information 
cell of the matching text form is saved. The number of dictionary 
forms skipped since the last one matched is also saved. These two pieces 
of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text 
form constitute the table of dictionary usage. If each text form is 
marked when matched with a dictionary form, the text forms not contained 
in the dictionary can be identified when all dictionary forms have 
been read. The appropriate action for handling these forms can be taken 
at that time.   Each dictionary form is looked up in the text-form 
list by the same method used to look up a new text occurrence in 
the form list during text reading. A random address **f that lies within 
the ~X-region of memory mentioned earlier is computed from the 
~i-th dictionary form. If cell **f is an information cell, it and 
any information cells in the ~Y-region that have been linked to **f 
each contain an address in the ~W-region where a potentially matching 
form is stored. The dictionary form is compared with each of these 
text forms. When a match is found, an entry is made in the table of 
dictionary usage. If cell **f is not an information cell we conclude 
that the ~i-th dictionary form is not in the text list.   These 
two steps essentially complete the lookup operation. The final step 
merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information 
that pertains to each form matched in the text-form list, and 
uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach
