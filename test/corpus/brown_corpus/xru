again, and had the house all trimmed up, hadn't brought many callers 
in two whole months.   Doc Dunne and Miss Sis had come. So 
had Miss Shawnee Rakestraw, full of criticisms about the changes here, 
giving thanks that her dear old father had gone to his Heavenly 
Rest last year, saying how much she enjoyed her boarding house in town 
in inclement weather, was looking forward to Quinzaine Spa this summer.

<There> was an idea. Miss Kizzie had been right snippy 
ever since they were married, though you'd have thought a namesake 
would 
have brought her round. Oh, she'd come to see them once, left silver 
teething rings for all of the trips. But when Miss Jen went over 
right away to return the call, Miss Kiz couldn't have been very 
cordial, for she'd come back before she hardly had time to get there. 
More and more, these days, she'd been driving that pretty little 
mare that looked like her, over to Tillie's and Nick's- his own 
old square frame box on posts, chickens and cats and pups under the 
house, everybody friendly inside, making a to-do over the babies dressed 
like dollies. Though he was glad she got on well with his young folks, 
she ought to be welcome at the finest house in the land, too.

It made him pretty hot under the collar, after the idea Miss Sis 
had given him, to be told by Miss Kiz that her holy spa was all reserved 
for this summer <and next>, if you please, and that much as 
she regretted it, they would be unable to entertain Mrs& Robards and 
the children. She hoped they were well.   He didn't tell Miss 
Jen, but she must have got word from the cook or nurse, who of course 
knew those Quinzaine nigs, and she really took a fit. If he <ever> 
did such a thing again she'd die of shame.   "Have a 
party an' leave 'em out, hon", he suggested. "A <swell> party, 
send an invite to <ever'body> but them- those folks you met 
at the Galt House, the ones I've got to know in this new Jockey 
Club affair, the whole dang neighborhood. We'll have oystchers- 
couple bar'l oystchers'll fetch in a crowd any time. I'll see 
word gets round".   "<Don't you dare!>"   Miss 
Jen was 
funny that way, funny that she didn't seem to take to his ideas and 
perk up. He was downright worried about her, but there was one more 
thing he could try **h.   Zion was surprised when Roy's buggy 
stopped beside her on the pike one early summer day as she was walking 
home from the country school where she was teaching now that Eph Showers 
had had a call to preach in some mountain town.   Roy smiled- 
he <did> have a nice smile- took off his hat most politely, 
told her to hop in, and he'd give her a lift to Quinzaine. Her hesitation 
was only momentary and she hoped he didn't notice it, as she 
settled herself, asked quickly how Miss Jenny and the babies were 
getting on.   "See for yourself, Miss Zion. It won't take 
a minute". He swung in through his own wide gateway. "Them's 
the purtiest babes you ever did see, but Miss Jen gets mighty lonesome. 
She'll relish the sight of a friendly face. Miss Kiz won't 
care your comin', will she"?   "Why of course not", Zion 
said uncomfortably.

"He must have forgiven me", Henrietta murmured to the room. 
The absolution of Doaty's last will and testament was proof enough 
of that; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman.

She found herself wishing an old wish, that she had told Doaty 
she was running away, that she had left something more behind her 
than the loving, sorry note and her best garnet pin. Perhaps Doaty 
had guessed already and kept her counsel.   Henrietta thought, It's 
extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us. There 
had been more to know about Hetty, inevitably, and most of it unfavorable. 
Adelia was the good one, or, if not always good, less frequently 
tempted. Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without 
Hetty's flair for drama, especially through the long summers. In 
winter, in the city, there had been the Maneret School, which taught 
excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge; there had 
been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really 
profound distaste for his pupils; there had been the dancing class- 
Miss Craddock, thin and tireless, with her supervising wand and her 
everlasting <one>-two-three, <one>-two-three. There had been supper 
parties and teas, fetes and little balls, Mama small and pretty 
and gay and Papa enormously jocular, enormously possessive, the sun 
around 
which the Blackwell planets revolved.   Mama had died before 
the corruption of the family circle, the interruption of Charles. 
It was safe to assume that Papa, sighing heavily, had said many times 
to his remaining daughter, "Thank God your poor mother was spared 
this", and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta 
to leave, with her hand in Charles' hand, just because 
her "poor 
mother" was gone already and would never know. Mama was vulnerable; 
one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her.

But I would have gone anyway, thought Henrietta. She had always 
been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no 
choice. Only at this moment- perhaps because it was before dawn and 
she was lying in Doaty's bed- she found herself examining how others 
might regard her. Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted 
just of that ability to see a choice.   She turned on her side, 
finding the idea oppressive. If Adelia had felt about someone as 
Henrietta felt about Charles, would she have run away with him?

Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone. No temptation, 
no sin.   No temptation, no virtue?   A curious 
thought to end a curious night. The birds were really awake now in a 
colloquy of music, and light was beginning to creep across the room, 
touching sill and door, table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers 
in their artificial blossom and leaf.   Before anything else, she 
would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten 
garden. Everything must wait upon this mission, this sentimental duty 
of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards. She closed her eyes, remembering 
the small French cemetery, enclosed by stone walls. It had 
always seemed to rain there, and even the grass was gray.   After 
the sad impatient moment, waiting for comfort which could not come, 
she slipped out of bed and went to the open window. The garden below 
was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness. Leaning 
out, 
she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle, one not quite come 
to bloom, one just beyond it. On a thrusting spray thick with thorns 
and dewdrops and swelling pink buds, like a summer Valentine, a bird 
balanced and sang, nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music, 
a little engine of song.   It was so pretty and artless that 
she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot 
to play on the wet grass with all the growing things, but Doaty never 
permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but <une femme 
d'un certain age>. Feeling suddenly neat and subdued, she dressed 
quite soberly and went downstairs.   Rosa, unbelievably, was 
not yet up and about, reassurance that Rosa was human. Feeling protective 
toward this sleeping being, Henrietta found a yesterday bun and 
milk in a white jug, a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of 
going barefoot.   Outside, the garden, the tame wilderness, yielded 
a patchwork bouquet of daisies, sweet william, scented stock and lady's 
bedstraw, which she tied with long grasses and took back to show 
Rosa, who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly. 
The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers, 
supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws.   Henrietta held 
her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty. "Rummaging in 
the dew", said Rosa coldly. "Go change your shoes before you turn 
around". She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed 
her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay 
home. Folly danced, eager for whatever lay beyond the door.   To 
a Blackwell, there was only one church. The cemetery slumbered just 
behind it, and the way lay through the village and close to the sea. 
For the first time in thirty years, Henrietta walked down the narrow 
street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying 
her with the frankest curiosity. She smiled and bowed, recalling 
the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child. 
Now, some of the acknowledgments were cautious, but all were interested.

An old man, sitting against the wall of a cottage and 
waiting for the sun to find him, gave her a more than reflective look 
as she passed, the sap still plainly rising in his branches. On an impulse, 
she turned back and said good morning.   He cupped his ear 
and shook his head at her repetition, announcing in a nettled way that 
he had heard her the first time. He then offered his own estimate 
of the weather, which was unenthusiastic. "Summer's been slow to 
come", he said. "It's my dryin' out time". He scowled at her 
flowers.   "I'm taking them to the cemetery", said Henrietta, 
out of a vague feeling of hospitality.   "They'll be 
takin' me next", he said pleasantly, "but not so soon's they 
plan. See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin. 
It's dryin' myself out that does it". He regarded her with 
rising hope. "You'd like to hear how I go about it".   "It's 
nice of you", Henrietta said doubtfully.   "Y're 
welcome". He straightened himself, soldierly against the wall, and 
pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their 
old boots. His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became 
a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text. 
"Every 
month, f'r three days", he said happily, "I take no water into 
my system, no water whatsoever. It rests the tissues".   Henrietta 
murmured that she could quite see how it would, and he nodded approval 
of her womanly good sense. "Rests the tissues", he said, "and 
pacifies the system. My dad did it, and he lived to a great age". 
He looked up at her sharply. "Don't remember, do you"?

She did suddenly, through the link of memory with his father, 
old Titus, who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away. 
Next to the Blackwells, Titus had owned the island most, and she 
and Adelia had often stood in front of him, silenced by his terrible 
years- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like 
a mariner, more aged than possible. He had never spoken once to the 
awed sisters, but his son had been friendly, a big fellow of fifty 
or more, a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea. It must be 
that son who sat before her now, shriveled to half his size and half 
his senses.   She said gently, "Of course I remember you".

"Not so well's I remember you", he said. "Y're the 
young Blackwell woman. Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded 
man. I know all about you".   "You do seem to", said 
Henrietta, impressed.   "Can't blame a man for leavin' his 
wife", he said quite cheerfully. "Left mine many a time, only she 
never knew it. Man in a boat, there's a lot of places he can put 
in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit. Any harm in that"?

"Probably", said Henrietta dryly.   He gave 
a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly. "You'd be the one 
to say", he observed, and she found herself liking his approval none 
too well, but she could not defend herself and say that her actions 
were "different", since all actions had their own laws. Only, this 
old man's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter's 
open censure. Well, she had not come back to Great Island to 
be understood, praised or condemned. She had come to make her peace 
with the past, and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind 
of shadow.   She started to move away, just as a woman came out 
of the cottage, a big-boned, drab-haired figure with a clean apron 
tied over her limp print dress. She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and 
spoke to the old man. "You've not had your breakfast yet, gran'dad".
