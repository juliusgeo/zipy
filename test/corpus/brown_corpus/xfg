I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on 
the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.   "I am thoroughly 
convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects 
nature will do his composing for him; as a result, such pictures are 
only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before 
him. Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot 
is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting, 
unless the position serves the design of the whole composition. 
If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain 
units in his design, often only slightly, finer pictures would result. 
Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other 
objects like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the original 
sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they 
occupy the right position, which I call 'clicking'.   "Speed 
in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity 
and crispness, but unless the artist has lots of experience so that 
he can control rapid execution, he would do well to take these first sketches 
and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.

"If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition, 
I mean to project equal concern for color. Often, in working 
out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere, a particular 
passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be 
too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when viewed indoors in 
a mat. When this occurs, I make the change on the sketch or on the 
final watercolor- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field.

"When working from one of my sketches I square it up and 
project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal. 
When this linear draft is completed, I dust it down to a faint 
image. From this point, I paint in as direct a manner as possible, by 
flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage. 
However, first 
I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and 
design along the lines I have described. Then I plan my attack: 
the parts I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting of 
minor details- all in all, mechanics of producing the finished job 
with a maximum of crispness. The longer I work, the more I am sure 
that for me, at least, a workmanlike method is important. Trial and 
error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles 
in the final painting.   "As for materials, I use the 
best available. I work on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently 
resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue 
strain. In my studio I work at a tilt-top table, but leave the paper 
unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes. I have 
used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English 
make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight. After selecting a sheet 
and inspecting it for flaws (even the best sometimes has foreign 'nubbins' 
on its surface), I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with 
clean, cold water. Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that 
it will lie flat as a board.   "In addition to the usual tools, 
I make constant use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes, 
but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to open up lights 
in dark washes. The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that 
it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the 
watercolorist. I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large 
washes in the studio.

"My brushes are different from those used 
by most watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle. The 
red sables are @8; two riggers, @6 and @10; and a very large, 
flat wash brush. The bristles are a Fitch @2 and a one-half 
inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.   "My usual palette 
consists of top-quality colors: alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna, 
raw umber, burnt sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French 
ultramarine blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green @2, cadmium yellow 
pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's gray, 
and ivory black".   In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason, 
the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness, 
yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration 
here. True, a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis 
of nature rather than a detailed inventory. Unlike many decorative patterns 
that present a static flat convention, this artist's pictures 
are full of atmosphere and climate.   Long observation has taught 
Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes: 
a foreground in sharp focus- either a light area with dark accents 
or a dark one with lights; a middle distance often containing the 
major motif; and a background, usually a silhouetted form foiled against 
the sky. In following this general principle, Mason provides the 
observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background, 
and the illusion of depth is instantly created.   When painting, 
Mason's physical eyes are half-closed, while his mind's eye 
is wide open, and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression 
he wishes to convey. He does not insist on telling all he knows about 
any given subject; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw 
on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia. It is for this 
reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition 
of place for their enjoyment. His pictures generalize, though 
they are inspired by a particular locale; they universalize in terms 
of weather, skies, earth, and people. By dealing with common landscape 
in an uncommon way, Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American 
landscape art. Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience 
of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor, 
a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor 
the Creator of it all.   The artist was born in Gilbert Mills, 
New York, in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife moved 
to California, he lived in western New York, in Batavia. When 
I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 
15th, I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for 
a watercolorist: the water sign of Pisces (February 18-March 20). 
And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes, and 
how appropriate that he should appear in AMERICAN ARTIST again, 
in his natal month of March!   Over the years, beginning in 
1929, Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold 
medals; two Ranger Fund purchase awards; the Joseph Pennell 
Memorial Medal; two American Watercolor Society prizes; the Blair 
Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute of Chicago; 
and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua, New Haven, Rochester, 
Rockport, and most recently, the $300 prize for a watercolor at 
the Laguna Beach Art Association,   He was elected to the National 
Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 
(after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy 
in 1930), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940. Other memberships 
include the American Watercolor Society, Philadelphia Water 
Color Club, Allied Artists of America, Audubon Artists, Baltimore 
Watercolor Society.

The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts 
in the 1960 Olympics for one reason- they were better. They were 
better trained, better looking, better built, better disciplined **h 
and something else- <they were better dancers>. Our athletes are 
only just beginning to learn that they must study dance. The Russians 
are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.

But why gymnastics at all? And is the sport really important? 
After all, we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics 
competition. But if it is important, what can we do to improve ourselves? 
It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem, 
for just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has some very 
important things to learn from gymnastics.   Taking first things 
first, let's understand the sport called gymnastics. It is made up 
of tumbling, which might be said to start with a somersault, run through 
such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels, backbends, and 
culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists 
**h and apparatus work. The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a 
common sight in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in favor 
of games. The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard, horizontal bar, 
rings, and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball, 
volleyball, basketball and football.   But the Russians use 
gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because 
it provides training in every basic quality except one, endurance. The 
gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination, timing, 
rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and the desire for perfection. 
In short, gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great 
deal of character as well. The addition of endurance training later, 
when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury, 
provides that final quality that makes the top athlete, soldier 
or citizen.   Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that 
it can be started very early in life. (An enterprising teacher or parent 
<could> start training a healthy child at the age of seven days. 
Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries.) 
In most sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on the side 
of those who begin young, and the Russian competitor of 16 has at 
least thirteen years of training behind him. The American is very lucky 
if he has three.   If a nation wished to get a head start in 
physical fitness over all other nations, it would start its kindergarten 
students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus 
eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools. 
First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension, 
since action relieves both. Oddly enough, it is proven that there 
would be less reading difficulty. Certainly there would be less anxiety, 
fewer accidents (it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries), 
and higher scholastic averages, since alert children work better. 
Russia knows this, and that is why there were over 800,000 competing 
for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team. Eighty 
thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself. We 
could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.

And what has dancing to do with all this? A great deal. 
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous 
training on apparatus. Well-stretched, trained in posture and coordinated 
movement, and wedded to rhythm, they presented the audiences 
in 
Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic 
contest. American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons. 
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing 
with incredible grace. They were further stripped of old wive's 
tales 
by seeing the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring 
tremendous strength **h and with not one bulging muscle.   President 
Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation. If 
we wait until children are in junior high or high school, we will never 
manage it. To be fit, one has to start early with young children, 
and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher 
of dance. If the dance teachers of America make it their business 
to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come 
some day if our schools are really responsible, we will be that much 
ahead. School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they must do, 
will need demonstrators. There should be youngsters who know how to do 
a headstand, and also how to help other children learn it. They should 
know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for 
the sports we will demand be taught.   Dance teachers can respond 
to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular 
dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes 
for strength and flexibility.   Very little in today's living 
provides the strength we need **h and nothing provides the flexibility. 
Dancers do have flexibility. They often fail, however, to develop 
real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength. Ask any group 
of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results, 
considering the amount of physical training they have had, will be
