I don't know about that much", said Mr& Skyros. "And you know, 
Angelo, Pretty, he always keeps it a strict cash basis, like they 
say"-   "Sure", said Angie. "Sure, Mr& Skyros. 
Fifty a throw, that the deal? Sure. I bring you the cash, say five 
hundred for ten decks. Never mind how much I cut it, how much I 
get", and he smiled his sleepy smile again. "Standard deal, Mr& 
Skyros. You go 'n' have a look round for it".   "I 
do my best", said Mr& Skyros earnestly, "just for you, my friend. 
This is awkward for everybody, isn't it, we all got to put up with 
inconvenience sometimes. But I do my best for you". He got out 
of there in a hurry, brushing past another man in the door, mopping 
his brow.   The expedient thing- yes, very true, one must make 
do as one could, in some situations. It could all be straightened out 
later. Not very much later, but when things had settled down a little. 
After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through. An ace 
of spades **h. He was not a superstitious man, but he felt perhaps 
there was a little something in that, indeed. He rather wished he 
had never got into the business, and still- scarcely to be resisted, 
a nice little profit with not much work involved, easy money **h

Katya Roslev, who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now, 
rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change. She 
did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without 
a smile or a word of thanks. Usually she marked the few who did 
thank you, you didn't get that kind much in a place like this: and 
she played a little game with herself, seeing how downright rude she 
could act to the others, before they'd take offense, threaten to call 
the manager. Funny how seldom they did: used to it, probably. The 
kind who came into a cheap store like this! Grab, snatch, I saw 
that first! and, Here, I'll take this, I was before <her>, 
you wait on me now or I don't bother with it, see! This kind of 
place **h   She'd be through here, just no time at all- leave 
this kind of thing 'way behind. Off at noon, and she'd never come 
back. Never have to. Money- a lot of money, <enough>. She'd 
be smart about it, get him to give it to her in little bills so's 
nobody would suspect- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account 
of that, the banks- But that wasn't really long to wait. Not when 
she'd waited so long already.   No need say anything at all 
to the old woman. She had it all planned out, how she'd do. She'd 
say she didn't feel good on Sunday, couldn't go to church- there'd 
be a little argument, but she could be stubborn- and when the 
old woman had gone, quick pack the things she'd need to take, all 
but the dress she'd wear Monday, and take the bag down to that place 
in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight, for 
a dime. Then on Monday morning- or it might have to be Tuesday- 
get up and leave just the usual time, and last thing, put the money 
in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer. She 
wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left, 
go do the daily shopping. No need leave a note with it, either- 
or maybe just something like, Don't worry about me, I'm going away 
to make a better life.   A better life. Escape. It wasn't 
as if she wanted <much>. She didn't mind working hard, not as if 
she figured to do anything <wrong> to live easy and soft- all she 
wanted was a <chance>, where she wasn't marked as what she was. 
To 
be Katharine Ross, and work in a nicer shop somewhere, at a little 
more money so she could have prettier clothes, and learn ladies' manners 
and all like that, and get to know different people than up to now, 
not just the ones like her here, with foreign-sounding names, the 
ones went to the same church and- Different place, different job, different 
people, she'd be all different too. Prettier, she'd do her 
hair another way; smarter, and wear different kinds of clothes- 
she'd be Katharine Ross, just what that <sounded> like. 
"You've give me the wrong change", said the customer sharply. "Think 
I can't count"?   Katya made up the amount in indifferent 
silence. She was listening to other voices, out of the future. 
Some of those vaguely-imagined new, different people. <Oh, Katharine's 
awfully nice, and pretty too, I like Katharine- Let's 
ask Katharine to go with us, she's always lots of fun- Katharine>-

Soon, very soon now **h #@ SIXTEEN @#

Mendoza 
didn't 
wake until nearly nine-thirty. It was going to be another hot 
day; already the thermometer stood close to ninety. Alison was still 
sound asleep; he made fresh coffee and searched through all the desk 
drawers for more cigarettes before thinking of her handbag, and found 
a crumpled stray cigarette at its bottom, which tasted peculiarly 
of face powder. He left a note propped on the desk asking her to call 
him sometime today, and drove home.   After he'd got out fresh 
liver for Bast, he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her 
dish. Surely she <was> just a trifle fatter around the middle? He 
seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters, 
and suffered a dismaying vision of the apartment overrun with a 
dozen kittens. "<@Y que sigue despues?>- what then"? he 
asked her severely. "A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't 
like cats, it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good 
homes for kittens- and, damn it, you know very well if I have them 
around long, impossible to give them away! And I suppose now that 
you've finally grown up, if a little late, you'd go on producing 
kittens every six months or so. Yes, well, it's a pity to spoil your 
girlish figure- which all those kittens would do anyway- but I 
think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so 
there won't be any more **h. I wonder if the Carters would take one 
**h. And it's no good looking at me like that", as she wound affectionately 
around his ankles. 
Maude's long nose unexpectedly wrinkled up. "Happened to be in the 
hall! Happened to hear you quarrel about her! Oh, well, you can't 
really blame Lolotte. She lost her beau to you".   But 
she was talking of Emile when she saw the black line of the open door; 
Sarah remembered it clearly. Maude went on. "I've got to 
get busy. Miss Celie's taken to her bed, with the door locked. She 
opened it an inch and poked out the keys for me to give you. Here"- 
She thrust a bundle of keys strung on a thick red cord into Sarah's 
hand. "Not that there's much use in locking up the smokehouse 
and the storehouse now. Drink your coffee"-   Coffee. 
"It's- cold". Maude suddenly looked quite capable of pouring 
it down her throat. "I don't want it", Sarah said, firmly.

"Oh. Well- I'll take it down with me as I go". 
Maude swooped up the cup and hiked up her top hoop as if about to take 
off with a racing start. At the door she turned back, her Roman nose 
looking very long now and satiric. "I forgot. Ben and Lucien 
have gone after them. It's just like that book your Northern friend 
wrote- except there aren't any ice floes to cross and no bloodhounds".

"I don't know Mrs& Stowe **h. What can they 
do if they find them"?   "They can't do anything. It's 
silly, childish, running after them like that. I told Ben so. But 
of course the paterollers won't be of any help, not with everything 
so upset and that Yankee cavalry outfit they say is running around, 
God knows where".   She had swished away, she had been gone for 
a long time probably when Sarah suddenly realized that she ought to 
stop her, pour out the coffee, so no one would drink it. But then the 
so-called coffee was bad enough at best, cold it was all but undrinkable- 
especially that cup!   She was deeply, horribly sure 
that Lucien had filled it with opium. She had quarreled with Lucien, 
she had resisted his demands for money- and if she died, by the provisions 
of her marriage contract, Lucien would inherit legally not 
only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboards in the office, but 
later, when the war was over, her father's entire estate.   She 
felt cold and hot, sticky and chilly at the same time. Now wait a 
minute, she told herself, think about it; Lucien is not the only person 
in this house who could have put opium in that coffee.   She 
had lost a bottle of opium- but that was on the trip from New Orleans. 
Or someone had taken it during her first day at Honotassa. Yes, 
she had missed it after her talk with Emile, after dinner, just 
before Emile was shot. Rilly or Glendora had entered her room while 
she slept, bringing back her washed clothes. So somebody else could 
have come in, too- then or later while she was out of the room. It 
would have been easy to identify as opium by its odor.   It was 
not very reasonable to believe that Lucien had procured unprocurable 
opium and come back to Honotassa with a formed plan to murder her. He 
didn't even know that she was there. And he certainly couldn't 
have guessed that she would resist his demand for the gold or that she 
was not the yielding- yes, and credible fool he had every right to 
expect. No, he had been surprised, unpleasantly surprised, but surprised.

Then somebody else? Don't question, Rev had said, don't 
invite danger. Her skin crawled: Lolotte had told Maude that 
she was in the hall and the door was open. Sarah had begun to tell 
Lucien of Emile, she had begun to question and a little draft had crept 
across the room from the bedroom door, open barely enough to show 
a rim of blackness in the hall. So Lolotte- or anybody- could have 
listened, and that somebody could have already been supplied with 
the missing bottle of opium.   That was not reasonable either. 
The opium had disappeared before Emile's death and whoever shot him 
could not by any stretch of the imagination have foreseen Sarah's 
own doubts and suspicions- and questions.   She began to doubt 
whether there had been in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup. So 
suppose somebody only wished to frighten her, so she would leave Honotassa!

That made a certain amount of logic. Added to the 
argument was the fact that while she might have tasted the coffee if it 
had been still hot, she might even have drunk some of it, she wouldn't 
have taken enough to kill her, for she would have been warned by 
its taste.   No. It was merely an attempt to frighten her.

She wouldn't go back to New York as Maude suggested; she wouldn't 
run like a scared cat. But- well, she'd be very careful.

She dressed and the accustomed routine restored to her a sense 
of normal everyday life.   But before she left her room she dug 
into her big moire bag, took out the envelope holding her marriage contract 
and the wax seal had been broken. So somebody else knew what 
would happen to her father's money if she died.   Rev had known 
all along. Rev didn't need to break the wax seal, read the contract 
and find out. He could conceivably have wished to make sure; Rev 
loved Honotassa, it was like a part of his breath and body; Rev 
had stressed the need for money. Rev would never have tried to give her 
poison!   She thrust the envelope back in the bag; there 
was no point in locking it up in the armoire now, it was like locking 
the barn after the horse was stolen. And in all likelihood, by now, 
there was more than one person in the house who knew the terms of her 
marriage contract. There was no point either in telling herself again 
what a fool she'd been.   She went downstairs and received another 
curious shock, for when Glendora flapped into the dining room in 
her homemade moccasins, Sarah asked her when she had brought coffee 
to her room and Glendora said she hadn't. "Too much work this morning, 
Miss Sarah- everybody gone like that"-   Sarah swallowed 
past another kind of constriction in her throat. "Well, then 
who brought it"?   "Miss Maude. She come to the kitchen 
and say she take it up to you". Glendora put down a dish of lukewarm 
rice. "Not much breakfast this morning. I don't know what we're 
going to do, Miss Sarah".   "We've got to eat", 
Sarah said, curtly, because a chill crawled over her again. Maude?

Glendora flapped away. The rice wasn't dosed with opium,
