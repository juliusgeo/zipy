to the courthouse and caught the sheriff just as he was leaving.

"Sounds like what you're after", he said when Hank had 
finished. "Come on, let's hurry down before they lock up for the 
day".   In the basement the sheriff took him to a small, dingy 
office occupied by a tall, thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeves.

"Mr& Ferrell **h Hirey Lindsay, chairman of the board 
of supervisors. Mr& Ferrell is a private detective, Hirey. Wants 
to look up something in the newspaper files, so don't lock him 
in here".   "Sure", said Hirey. "I'll just leave the 
door open. It latches when you close it, so stay as long as you like".

Carruthers crossed the room to a metal door with an open 
grillework in the top half. He pulled it open. "Now don't shut this 
door. It won't open from inside. Before we built the new jail, 
we used to keep prisoners in here overnight sometimes when the old jail 
got too crowded. Hirey treats himself a lot better than we do prisoners. 
They were a sight more comfortable than the ones in the jail with 
the cold air from Hirey's air conditioner coming through the grille".

He walked past the sheriff into a windowless room with 
shelves full of big, leather-bound volumes from floor to ceiling all 
around the walls. A metal table and four chairs stood in the center.

"They're all here, back to 1865", Carruthers told him. 
"It's all right to smoke, but make sure your cigarettes are out 
before you leave. And, of course, you know not to take clippings".

"I'll leave the air conditioner on for you, Mr& Ferrell", 
said Hirey. "Don't forget to turn it off and close the door 
good so it'll latch".   Hank thanked them and promised to 
observe the rules. When they had gone, he stood for a minute breathing 
in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrumming 
air conditioner couldn't quite dispel. 

#CHAPTER FOURTEEN#

In 
a tour around the stacks, he found that the earliest volumes began on 
the left and progressed clockwise around the room. An old weakness for 
burrowing in records rose up to tempt him.   It was, indeed, 
all here- almost a century. From reconstruction to moon rockets. But 
he pulled away from the irrelevant old volumes and walked around to 
the newer ones.   Last year's volume was at the top a couple 
of inches below the ceiling. Near it was a metal ladder on casters attached 
to the top shelf. He pulled it over, climbed up, and lifted out 
the big volume, almost losing his balance from the weight of it. He 
staggered over and dropped it on the table.   Since Mrs& Calhoun 
remembered only that the marriage had been in the spring, he started 
to plod through several months. He tried to turn right to the society 
page in each one, but interesting stories kept cropping up to distract 
him. At last he found it in the paper of April 2.   It 
told him little more than Mrs& Calhoun had remembered, stating that 
it had been a small, modest wedding compared to some of the others.

There was a marked contrast in the amount of information on bride 
and groom. Mr& Black's life was an open book, so to speak, from 
his birth in Jackson, Mississippi, through his basketball-playing 
days at L&S&U& and his attainment of a B&A& degree, which 
had presumably prepared him for his career as district sales manager 
for Peerless Business Machines.   The one line on the bride 
said she was Miss Lisa Carmody from Baton Rouge. No mention of 
New Orleans.   Hank was beginning to feel sharp concern for 
Mr& Black. If Mrs& Black was who he thought she was, Mr& Black's 
Peerless selling days might well be over.   Now for their 
exodus from Gulf Springs. This time the search took twice as long, 
cutting down on his extra reading, for he had to pick through several 
columns of one- and two-line social notes in each issue. He found 
it in the edition of May 15. The item said Mr& and Mrs& Black 
had moved to Jackson, his home town- so the lovely Lisa had been 
with him a year ago.   Next on his program was a call to the Jackson 
office of Peerless Business Machines to find out if Vincent 
Black was still with them- or, more specifically, still with <us>.

He glanced at his watch, saw it was only seven, and decided 
to indulge his weakness now. For the next hour he scrambled happily 
up and down the ladder, sharing the excitement of reporters who had seen 
McKinley's assassination, the Iroquois Theater fire in Chicago, 
and the Hall-Mills trial.   In the middle of the stock market 
crash, he heard a slight noise in the outer office. He turned around, 
saw nothing, and decided it must be a mouse. Something else distracted 
him, yet there was no sound, only tomblike silence. Then he knew 
it was not sound, but lack of it. The air conditioner was no longer 
running.   He jumped up and turned around to see the metal door 
closing. It clanged shut as he sprang toward it.   He pressed 
his face against the grille. "Who's there"?   The light 
shining through the grille dimly illumined the office beyond- enough 
for him to see there was no one there. Then he heard the outer door 
closing.   "Hey, come back", he shouted. He thought it must 
be some damn janitor or cleaning woman puttering around, figuring 
that Hirey had gone off and forgotten to turn off everything and lock 
up. _hen the faint beginnings of fear stirred in his mind. Unless 
he was stone-blind, the person who'd just left couldn't have missed 
seeing Hank through the open door of the brightly lighted room. And 
even if he'd somehow missed seeing him, he wouldn't have gone off 
and left the light on and door open in the file room.   Whoever 
it was had meant to shut him up in here, had followed him and waited 
till the courthouse and square were deserted. But why? To search 
his room at the motel? To come back later and kill him after the stores 
had closed around the square and everybody had left? No, they 
could 
kill him just as easy right now. Nobody could hear what was going 
on in this underground vault.   Then he heard it and smelled it- 
the steady hissing, the dread, familiar pungency of gas escaping. 
It must be coming from an upright heater against the far wall in the 
supervisors' office.   Until now, Lilac Gaylor and Lila Kingsley 
had been like an anagram which he could unscramble at his own pace 
and choosing.   Except for those minutes in her room, he had 
lost touch with her as a reality. Gaylor's obsession and Cunningham's 
chimera-chasing reminiscences had mesmerized him into thinking 
of Lila and Lilac, separately or together, as a legend. They kept drifting 
apart and merging again in his mind like some minute form of life 
on a microscope slide.

"Well"- said Mr& Skyros. "I take a little time to 
think it over". It was awkward: very awkward. There would be all 
the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over. Someone reasonably 
trustworthy. And Angie would hear about it. And Angie knew-

"Time", said Angie, and he smiled very sweet and slow at 
Mr& Skyros. "Not too much time, because I'll be needing some 
more myself pretty much right away. And I done favors for you, big 
favor not so long back, didn't I, and I'm right here to take on 
where Pretty left off. No trouble. I don't want no trouble, you 
don't want no trouble, nobody wants trouble, Mr& Skyros".

Dear heaven, no, thought Mr& Skyros, turning away as another 
man came in. He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand; 
the genial smile seemed painted on his face. Angie knew- Speak 
of dangerous information! Angie knew too much entirely already. Really 
he had Mr& Skyros at bay **h   "Big favor I done 
you. Acourse there's this deal o' Denny's- and Jackie's- 
kinda hangin' fire, ain't it, maybe you've been kinda worryin' 
over that. And can't say I blame you", said Angie thoughtfully. 
"This deal with the ace o' spades. Anything to do with an ace 
o' spades, bad luck".   Ace of spades- a widow, that was 
what they called a widow, these low-class crooks remembered Mr& Skyros 
distractedly. All about that Angie knew, too. When things got 
a little out of hand, they very rapidly got a lot out of hand- it seemed 
to be a general rule. All just by chance, and in a way tracing 
back to poor Frank, all of it, because naturally- brothers, living 
together- and Angie-   Mr& Skyros did not at all like the 
look on Angelo's regular-featured, almost girlishly good-looking 
face- 
or indeed anything about Angelo. Mr& Skyros was not a man 
who thought very much about moral principles; he found money much more 
interesting; but all the same he thought now, uneasily, of the way 
in which Angelo earned his living- and paid for his own stuff- 
and eyed the soft smile, and the spaniel-like dark eyes, and he felt a 
little ill.   "Look, my friend", he said, "in my life I 
learn, how is it the proverb says, better an ounce of prevention to a 
pound of cure. I stay in business so long because I'm careful. Two 
weeks, a month, we talk it over again, and maybe if nothing happens 
meanwhile to say the cops know this and that, then we make a little deal, 
isn't it"?   "That's a long while", said Angie. 
"I tell you, you want to leave it that way, I don't fool around 
with it. I go over to Castro and get fixed up there. I can't wait 
no two weeks".   And Mr& Skyros didn't like Angie, but 
what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside, and not likely 
to come out- And Angie such a valuable salesman, Prettyman said- 
All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a 
whole new bunch of boys- Why did everything have to happen at once?

Denny said stupidly, "Why, you ain't turning Angie down, 
are you, Mr& Skyros? I mean, we all figured- I guess anybody'd 
figure- Angie"-   Angelo gave him an affectionate 
smile. "Mr& Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me", 
he said. "It's O&K&, Denny, everything's O&K& Ain't 
it, Mr& Skyros"?   Oh, God, the name repeated over 
and over, anybody to hear- Not being a fool, Mr& Skyros knew 
why. But aside from everything else, it would scarcely be pleasant 
to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually 
held- you could say- the whip hand. And all because of Domokous! 
If Mr& Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would 
eventually cause-   Of course, there was another factor. Angie 
worth his weight in gold right now, but these users, they sometimes 
went down fast. Who knew, Angie might not last long **h. 
The sweat broke out on Mr& Skyros' forehead as he realized he had 
been actually thinking- hoping- planning- perhaps-   Good 
God above, had not Domokous been enough?   He patted Angelo's 
thin shoulder paternally. "Now you don't want to go talking 
that way", he said. "Sure, sure, you're the one take over 
for Pretty, soon as I get the supply, get started up again, isn't 
it? You don't need worry, Angelo. I tell you, I know how it is 
with you, my friend, I sympathize, and I'll make it a special point- 
a special favor- get in touch, and get some stuff just for you. 
I don't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow, but I'll try 
my best, my friend. You see, you got to remember, we all got schedules, 
like any business! My man, he won't be around a little while, 
he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite. It's 
awkward, you see that, isn't it"?   "Well, that's 
your business, Mr& Skyros", said Angie, and his dreamy eyes 
moved past Mr& Skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass 
window. "I appreciate it, you do that. Sure. We don't none 
of us want no trouble **h. I'm in a room over the Golden Club on 
San Pedro, you just ask for me there, you want see me. Or maybe I 
call you- tonight? About nine o'clock, I call and see if you 
got any. A couple decks for me, Mr& Skyros- and ten-twelve to sell, 
see, I like to have a little ready cash".   "Oh, now,
