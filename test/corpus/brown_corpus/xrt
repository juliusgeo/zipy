money stretch for food, for the mortgage, for taxes, for shoes, for half 
soles, for overshoes, 
for clothes, for the new leaks in the roof, for gas 
and light bills; about keeping warm, about keeping well, about meeting 
the minor emergencies that came up once, twice, fifty times a day. 
Just dropping the baby's bottle and breaking it became a catastrophe, 
and Stuart wore out his shoes so fast that he was termed a major 
disaster.   The Abernathy furnace consumed fuel like a giant 
ravenous maw that had to be appeased by hurling tons of coal into its 
evil red depths, and no matter how much coal they put in the house remained 
cold. Cold came in the innumerable cracks that seemed to have sprung 
up, under doors, around loosened window frames, from the sleeping 
porches, the attic, from the widened cracks between shingles on the 
roof. Presently they had to give up running the furnace at full capacity 
and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen, which had never been 
removed when the new gas range was installed, and the fireplaces and 
an electric heater in Grandma's room. It was so cold and so wretched 
that a sort of desperate gaiety infected all of them, like people 
stormbound or shipwrecked or caught in some other freak of circumstance 
so that time stood still and minor anxieties fell away and the only 
important thing was to cling together and survive.   The pipes 
burst and they all laughed and stood in ice water to their ankles while 
they swabbed the bathrooms. They lived mainly in the kitchen; they 
moved Maggie's bed and the baby's basket there, and the rest of 
them undressed by the stove and ran groaning and shivering to the upper 
polar regions and plunged into icy beds. Grandma said it was just 
like the early mining camp days, and it was the way people ought to live, 
only she was getting too old to take the pleasure from it that she 
used to.   "You said a mouthful", Eugenia said grimly. Eugenia 
hated being cold worse than anything, and she was beginning to 
find the joys of poverty wearing thin. She said to Maggie that it was 
one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it, and it was 
beginning to look at if this one was going to last forever. 
"Plenty of people are poor all their lives".   "Plenty of 
people haven't our brains and talent".   "I know you when 
you start talking about brains and talent", Maggie said. "You're 
working up to something, and if you don't watch out you'll ruin 
your whole life one of these days just to prove that the Abernathy 
family is superior to everything, even a depression".   "The 
only thing that worries me is how I'm going to prove it", Eugenia 
said.   They begged Grandma to let them put a bed in the kitchen 
for her, but Grandma said she was getting too old to sleep in strange 
beds and be seen with her teeth out, and that she hoped to die in 
privacy like a Christian and if the Lord willed it to be of pneumonia 
than it would have to be that way. She didn't want to be the only 
one with a stove in her room, especially as her life span was nearly 
run out anyway, and she insisted that Hope have the heater. Hope wouldn't 
hear of it, and she took the heater back to Grandma's room, 
and Grandma took it back to Hope's room, and the two of them dragged 
it back and forth until Grandma tipped it over and almost set her 
bedspread on fire. She said that proved she wasn't to be trusted 
with a fire in her room, and she could be burned to a crisp without anybody 
knowing it. Eugenia suspected her of deliberately overturning the 
heater because she was getting tired of dragging it back and forth 
and still wanted her own way, but Hope said if Grandma wouldn't have 
the heater nobody would have it, so Grandma had to give in.

"Thrifty of her to use it up. Unusual in a case like this, 
but"-   "You can <joke!> Didn't you read it? <She's 
married that tenant!>"   "I read it, yes. This ought 
to simplify Tolley's life".   Laban had more to say. Tolley 
had gone to live in California. He'd mentioned it, himself, 
at church 
and everybody seemed to have the idea that Tolley had left because Jenny 
had jilted him for <Roy robards>. "It was plain as the nose 
on your face that they're laughing about it, Mamma. Zion stayed 
to get my pin, but it'll be a cold day in June when I go back".

"We will <both> go back, Laban"! Kizzie turned to go inside. 
"Let me stay and take the pictures you wanted, Mamma. The sun's 
right"-   "Pictures"? She swung around. "<What> 
pictures"?   "In Brace's room! You <told> me to 
bring my camera. I'm not going back"-   "Indeed you <are!> 
Why should I want pictures of an empty room now? Tolley 
had no idea of marrying that sneaky little Jenny! This- trip of 
his had nothing to do with her consorting with tenants, and I am going 
to see that everybody at Mt& Pleasant understands that simple fact. 
Wait for me, Laban, I'll be dressed in half a second"!

Frank followed her into the bedroom, hooked her dress up the back.

"<Hurry>, Frank! They're not going to laugh at the 
Fairbrothers and Labans very long! Tolley's going is <my> 
fault. I <drove> him away. You know it and I'll tell <everybody> 
exactly how it happened".   She was so beautiful, so valiant, 
so pitiable. He kissed her. "Make your confession to God, Kizzie 
dear, not to the congregation".   "I'll decide that when 
I get there. I was so cruel to Tolley, so unfair. But I'll 
be fair now! He <is> coming back, isn't he, Frank"? 
Yes, oh yes. What else was there to say? Returning to the log-house 
he found some favorite lines from Jonathan Swift on his lips:

"Under the window in stormy weather   I marry this man 
and woman together.   Let none but Him who rules the thunder

Put this man and woman asunder".   Absolution for his lie? 
He questioned God's taking time to telegraph the message, but 
he felt better about Kizzie, and he took the sealed envelope from its 
pigeonhole, wondering why he had preserved it. If he died before she 
did, she would never be unable to resist opening it. In any case he 
would be thrusting a burden on his remaining sons, making them parties 
to a deception peculiarly his own. It was simply <his> necessity 
to confess which had made him write and keep this thing. "You've 
told God, Frank", he said. "Why lacerate the- congregation"?

Reaching for an old clay pot, relic of pioneer days, he tore 
the envelope in pieces, dropping them into it, touching the little 
pyre to flame, watching it curl, the red sealing wax melting and bubbling 
in the feathery ash. Surely now his beloved son could rest in peace.

"'And let me go, for the night gathers me, and in the 
night shall no man gather fruit'". 
A beautiful and haunting line, 
a subtle genius, Swinburne, difficult not to envy a gifted man, and 
perhaps he did **h.   But there were great satisfactions, even for 
a small man. Beyond his window were the greening trees, new spring, 
eternal hope, eternal life. There lay Grand Fair's Quinzaine, 
his own young parents' graves, but new life and promise for his sons, 
grandsons. He poured his thimble of wine for the toast he'd made 
so often. "To absent loved ones". But this last time he drank not 
to Brace but "To Tolley"!

MR& ROBARDS- Jenny 
was the only person she knew of in the Mt& Pleasant neighborhood 
who called him that- was kind but too easygoing. It didn't bother 
him for everybody from the blacksmith to the preacher to say, "Howdy, 
Miss Jenny", adding a careless "Roy", but it did her.

He could put a stop to it, she told him again and again. Simply 
call Mr& Whipsnade <Oscar>, and Dr& Dunne <P&G>&, 
and C'un Major <Frank>. Mr& Robards laughed, said he'd 
feel a damn fool, plain-out couldn't do that even to please <her>.

"You could try. And if I <ever> hear you say 'Mist 
Laban' again I'll <scream>. And don't tell me you didn't 
at church Sunday. I <heard> you"!   He really hadn't 
meant to, he assured her, but it was plain to her that the importance 
of these small things was lost on Mr& Robards. How strange it was 
that he could give her this handsome house and carte blanche as to its 
beautiful furnishings, and fail her in- spiritual ways.   Another 
weakness- far more irritating than his manner of speaking, which 
he made only token effort to change- was his devotion to that old horse 
of Tolley's. <Her> horse, rather. But Mr& Robards' now, 
oh my yes, indeed, yes! He called her "the Mare" much as Mrs& 
Whipsnade spoke of "the Queen, God bless her". **h He, with 
fifteen or twenty horses or mares or geldings or what-nots out there 
in the barn, was reverent only of "the Mare", "the Racin' 
Mare", the revolting Gunny.   For the first few months of their 
marriage she had tried to be nice about Gunny, going out with him 
to watch this pearl without price stamp imperiously around in her stall. 
And what had happened? Gunny invariably tried to bite her. Nerves, 
Mr& Robards said, just a nip anyway. "Stand back, Miss Jen, 
she's oneasy of your scarf". Never, "Quit that, you sor'l 
devil"! Never concern for his wife's nerves, or the danger 
that the curled lip and big teeth might mark their own dear baby due in 
January. <She> musn't annoy <Gunny> whose foal was due then 
too!   Listening for hours to his laments that the war and "Mist 
Fair's" poverty afterwards had robbed the mare of many a racing 
triumph, and to his predictions of greatness for the procession 
of foals to come, Jenny could look forward to years of conflict with 
an <animal> who disliked her intensely and showed it. Gunny symbolized 
so much that was unpleasant- Tolley, the indifference with which 
the Fairbrothers and indeed the whole neighborhood now treated her 
and which she would die rather than acknowledge to her husband, his lack 
of understanding and sympathy in her present condition, her disgusting 
swollen stomach.   Human birth was no novelty to Mr& Robards. 
Tillie was a fine midwife and could get here quick, he suggested. 
Jenny's aversion to having Dr& Dunne, a former admirer, seemed 
silly to him, but he would humor her, get anybody she wanted, the best 
never being too good for her.   The chances were against his 
being here to humor her when her time came, she was sure. He would be 
in the barn, or riding for the veterinarian! Night after night he 
stayed with Gunny in the dead of winter, rubbing her with quarts of 
expensive liniment, fussing over her bran mash as the cook did over charlotte 
russe, tracking manure on the pretty new carpet when he did come 
to the house. Yet when the dear baby came, he had Tillie over here 
in a jiffy, and was as attentive and sweet and worried and happy when 
it was all over as any husband could have been.   Jenny wished 
now that she had had Dr& Dunne, feeling that somehow he wouldn't 
have allowed the dear baby to turn into triplets. There was something 
not <nice> about triplets, though their father seemed pleased, showing 
no disappointment that they hadn't been the son he wanted, saying, 
"You don't see triplets trippin' down the pike ever' day, 
Miss Jen, hon. Rhyme 'em up cute- Arcilla, Flotilla **h"

Edmonia for her mother, she said firmly, Jennifer, for herself, 
and-   "Kezziah, for Miss Kizzie", he suggested. "She 
was mighty good to you past times, an' this'll fetch her". Now 
she must be thinking of a boy-name, something special. Just wait till 
she saw the Mare's foal. Handsomest colt in all Kentucky. Strong 
too, up on his legs when he was an hour old. What about Royal Robards?

"<Why don't you name him Jesus Christ!>" 
She burst into tears.   Roy was deeply distressed. He'd had 
no idea how unhappy his sweet peach had been. Of course she wasn't 
herself right now, but as her strength came back her spirits didn't 
seem to rise with it. He had a good idea why not. Those elegant "At 
Home" cards she sent out, now she could wear her pretty clothes
