than a mass ideology, certainly deeper than the isolated individual; 
and the narrator recalls the words of his father, Vincent Berger: 
"It is not by any amount of scratching at the individual that one 
finally comes down to mankind".   The entire middle section 
of <The Walnut Trees> is taken up with the life of Vincent Berger 
himself, whose fragmentary notes on his "encounters with mankind" 
are now conveyed by his son. "He was not much older than myself" 
writes the narrator, "when he began to feel the impact of that human 
mystery which now obsesses me, and which makes me begin, perhaps, 
to understand him". For the figure of Vincent Berger Malraux has 
obviously drawn on his studies of T& E& Lawrence (though Berger 
fights on the side of the Turks instead of against them), and like 
both Lawrence and Malraux himself he is a fervent admirer of Nietzsche. 
A professor at the University of Constantinople, where his first 
course of lectures was on Nietzsche and the "philosophy of action", 
Vincent Berger becomes head of the propaganda department of the 
German Embassy in Turkey. As an Alsatian before the first World 
War he was of course of German nationality; but he quickly involves 
himself in the Young Turk revolutionary movement to such an extent 
that his own country begins to doubt his patriotism. And, after becoming 
the right-hand man of Enver Pasha, he is sent by the latter 
to pave the way for a new Turkish Empire embracing "the union of all 
Turks throughout Central Asia from Adrianople to the Chinese oases 
on the Silk Trade Route".   Vincent Berger's mission 
is a failure because the Ottoman nationalism on which Enver Pasha 
counted does not exist. Central Asia is sunk in a somnolence from which 
nothing can awaken it; and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing 
human any longer seemed to survive, Vincent Berger begins to dream 
of the Occident. "Oh for the green of Europe! Trains whistling 
in the night, the rattle and clatter of cabs **h". Finally, after 
almost being beaten to death by a madman- he could not fight back 
because madmen are sacred to Islam- he throws up his mission and 
returns to Europe. This has been his first encounter with mankind, and, 
although he has now become a legendary figure in the popular European 
press, it leaves him profoundly dissatisfied. Despite Berger's 
report, Enver Pasha refuses to surrender his dream of a Turkish Blood 
Alliance; and Vincent Berger learns that political ambition 
is more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about men. But as he discovers 
shortly, on returning among intellectuals obsessed by <le culte 
du moi,> his experience of action had also taught him a more positive 
lesson. "For six years my father had had to do too much commanding 
and convincing" writes the narrator, "not to understand that man 
begins with 'the other'".   And when Vincent Berger returns 
to Europe, this first result of his encounters with mankind is 
considerably enriched and deepened by a crucial revelation. For a dawning 
sense of illumination occurs in consequence of two events which, 
as so often in Malraux, suddenly confront a character with the existential 
question of the nature and value of human life. One such event 
is the landing in Europe itself, when the mingled familiarity and strangeness 
of the Occident, after the blank immensities of Asia, shocks 
the returning traveller into a realization of the infinite <possibilities> 
of human life. 
In a pessimistic assessment of the cold war, Eden declared: "There 
must be much closer unity within the West before there can be effective 
negotiation with the East". Ordinary methods of diplomacy within 
the free world are inadequate, said the former Prime Minister. 
"Something much more thorough is required". Citing the experience 
of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in World War /2,, Eden said 
that all would have been confusion and disarray without them. "This", 
he said, "is exactly what has been happening between the politically 
free nations in the postwar world. We need joint chiefs of a political 
general staff". Citing the advances of Communist power in 
recent years, Sir Anthony observed: "This very grave state of 
affairs will continue until the free nations accept together the reality 
of the danger that confronts them and unite their policies and resources 
to meet it".   While I fully agree with Sir Anthony's 
contention, I think that we must carry the analysis farther, bearing 
in mind that while common peril may be the measure of our <need>, 
the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the 
measure of our <capacity>.   While it is hazardous to project 
the trend of history, it seems clear that a genuine community is painfully 
emerging in the Western world, particularly among the countries 
of Western Europe. At the end of World War /2,, free Europe was 
ready for a new beginning. The excesses of nationalism had brought 
down upon Europe a generation of tyranny and war, and a return to the 
old order of things seemed unthinkable. Under these conditions a new 
generation of Europeans began to discover the bonds of long association 
and shared values that for so long had been subordinated to nationalist 
xenophobia. A slow and painful trend toward unification has taken 
hold, a trend which may at any time be arrested and reversed but which 
may also lead to a binding federation of Europe. It may well be 
that the unification of Europe will prove inadequate, that the survival 
of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of 
the entire Western world.   The movement toward European unity 
has been expressed in two currents: federalism and functionalism, 
one looking to the constitution of a United States of Europe, the 
other building on wartime precedents of practical coo^peration for the 
solution of specific problems. Thus far the advances made have been 
almost entirely along functional lines.   Many factors contributed 
to the growth of the European movement. In 1946 Sir Winston Churchill, 
who had spoken often of European union during the war, advocated 
the formation of "a kind of United States of Europe". Had 
Churchill been returned to office in 1945, it is just possible that 
Britain, instead of standing fearfully aloof, would have <led> Europe 
toward union.   In 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive 
coo^rdinated efforts to achieve economic recovery led to the formation 
of the Organization for European Economic Coo^peration to supervise 
and coo^rdinate the uses of American aid under the Marshall 
Plan. The United States might well have exploited the opportunity 
provided by the European Recovery Program to push the hesitant European 
nations toward political federation as well as economic coo^peration, 
but all proposals to this effect were rejected by the United 
States Government at the time.   Another powerful factor in 
the European movement was the threat of Soviet aggression. The Communist 
coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was followed immediately by the 
conclusion of the Brussels Treaty, a 50-year alliance among Britain, 
France and the Benelux countries. And of course the Soviet threat 
was responsible for ~NATO, the grand alliance of the Atlantic 
nations.   New organs of unification proliferated in the decade 
following the conclusion of the ~NATO alliance. In 1949 the Council 
of Europe came into existence, a purely consultative parliamentary 
body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity. 
In 1952, the European Coal and Steel Community was launched, 
placing the coal and steel production of France, West Germany, Italy 
and Benelux under a supranational High Authority. For a time it 
appeared that a common European army might be created, but the project 
for a European Defense Community was rejected by the French National 
Assembly in 1954. In 1957 the social-economic approach to European 
integration was capped by the formation among "the Six" of 
a tariff-free European Common Market, and Euratom for coo^peration 
in the development of atomic energy.   The "overseas" democracies 
have generally encouraged the European unification movement 
without seriously considering the wisdom of their own full participation 
in a broader Atlantic community. The United States and Canada 
belong only to ~NATO and the new O&E&C&D&. Britain 
until recently went along in some areas with all of the enthusiasm of 
the groom at a shotgun wedding. In other areas it held back, pleading 
its Commonwealth bonds. Now Britain has decided to seek admission 
to the European Economic Community and it seems certain that she will 
be joined by some of her partners in the loose Free Trade Area 
of the "Outer Seven". Besides its historical significance as a 
break with the centuries-old tradition of British insularity, Britain's 
move, if successful, will constitute an historic landmark of the 
first importance in the movement toward the unification of Europe and 
the Western world.   If a broader Atlantic community is to 
be formed- and my own judgment is that it lies within the realm of both 
our needs and our capacity- a ready nucleus of machinery is at hand 
in the ~NATO alliance. The time is now ripe, indeed overdue, 
for the vigorous development of its non-military potentialities, for 
its development as an instrument of Atlantic community. What is required 
is the full implementation of Article 2 of the Treaty, which 
provides: "The Parties will contribute toward the further development 
of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening 
their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of 
the principles upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting 
conditions of stability and well-being. They will seek to eliminate 
conflict in their international economic policies and will encourage 
economic collaboration between any and all of them". As Lester 
Pearson wrote in 1955: "~NATO cannot live on fear alone. It 
cannot become the source of a real Atlantic community if it remains 
organized to deal only with the military threat which first brought 
it into being".   The problem of ~NATO is not one of machinery, 
of which there is an abundance, but of the will to use it. The 
~NATO Council is available as an executive agency, the Standing 
Group as a high military authority. The unofficial Conference of 
Parliamentarians is available as a potential legislative authority. 
This machinery will not become the instrument of an Atlantic community 
by fiat, but only when that community evolves from potentiality to 
reality. The existence of a community is a state of mind- a conviction 
that goals and values are widely shared, that effective communication 
is possible, that mutual trust is reasonably assured.   An 
equally promising avenue toward Atlantic community may lie through the 
development and expansion of the O&E&C&D& Conceived as 
an organ of economic coo^peration, there is no reason why O&E&C&D& 
cannot evolve into a broader instrument of union if its members 
so desire. Indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than ~NATO 
for the development of a parliamentary organ of the Atlantic 
nations, because it could encompass <all> of the members of the Atlantic 
community including those, like Sweden and Switzerland, who 
are unwilling to be associated with an essentially military alliance like 
~NATO.   Underlying these hopes and prescriptions is a 
conviction that the nations of the North Atlantic area do indeed form 
a community, at least a potential community. There is nothing new 
in this; what is new and compelling is that the West is now but one 
of several powerful civilizations, or "systems", and that one or 
more of the others may pose a mortal danger to the West. For centuries 
the North Atlantic nations dominated the world and as long as they 
did they could afford the luxury of fighting each other. That time 
is now past and the Atlantic nations, if they are to survive, must develop 
a full-fledged community, and they must also look beyond the frontiers 
of "Western civilization" toward a world-wide "concert of 
free nations". #/6,#

The burden of these reflections is that 
a broader unity among the free nations is at the core of our needs. 
And if we do not aspire to too much, it is also within our capacity. 
A realistic balancing of the need for new forms of international organization 
on the one hand, and our capacity to achieve them on the other, 
must be approached through the concept of "community". History 
has demonstrated many times that concerts of nations based solely on 
the negative spur of common danger are unlikely to survive when the external 
danger ceases to be dramatically urgent. Only when a concert of 
nations rests on the positive foundations of shared goals and values 
is it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy. It follows 
that the solution to the current disunity of the free nations is 
only to a very limited extent a matter of devising new machinery of consultation 
and coo^rdination. It is very much a matter of building 
the foundations of community.   It is for these reasons that proposals 
for a "new world order", through radical overhaul of the United 
Nations or through some sort of world federation, are utterly
