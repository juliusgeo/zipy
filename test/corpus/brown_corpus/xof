of these compounds are being studied.   In another study 
chromium-substituted aluminum oxyhydroxides and related species, prepared 
homogeneously by high-temperature hydrolysis, are being characterized 
and investigated spectrally in the ultraviolet region with a view 
to identification and semiquantitative estimation of the phases formed 
under varying preparative conditions. (J& A& Laswick, N& L&

#STRUCTURE AND PROPERTIES OF MACROMOLECULES#

_ELASTICITY 
OF MACROMOLECULAR NETWORKS_- The theory of elasticity of 
Gaussian networks has been developed on a more general basis and the 
equations of state relating variables of pressure, volume, temperature, 
stress and strain have been precisely formulated. Simple elongation 
has been treated in detail. The various stress-temperature coefficients 
for constancy of volume and strain, constancy of pressure and strain, 
and constancy of pressure and length have been interrelated. The 
dilation accompanying elongation and the simultaneously developed anisotropy 
of compressibility have been related to the elongation. In continuation 
of these theoretical studies, a more precise elucidation of 
the effects of imperfections in network structure is sought. (P& J& 
Flory, C& A& J& Hoeve) _CHAIN CONFORMATIONS OF POLYMERIC 
CHAINS_- Recent theoretical work to calculate the dimensions 
of polymeric chains by Volkenstein and Lifson has been extended to include 
more general types of chains. The mean-square end-to-end distance 
of the polyisobutylene chain has been calculated in reasonable agreement 
with values deduced from viscosity data. These studies are being 
extended to different polymers to increase our knowledge about the 
hindrances to rotation around chain bonds. (C& A& J& Hoeve, 
A& A& Blumberg) _CRYSTALLIZATION IN POLYMERS AND COPOLYMERS_- 
The crystallization of copolymers comprising **f units interspersed 
with a minor percentage of **f is limited by the inability of the 
crystal lattice characteristic of the former to accommodate the bulky 
side group of the latter. Only uninterrupted sequences of the former 
are eligible for formation of crystallites. Limitations on the lengths 
of these sequences diminish the stability of the comparatively short 
crystallites which can be formed, and this is reflected in a broadening 
of the melting range. (Robert Chiang, J& B& Jackson, P& 
J& Flory) Carefully executed melting studies on this system (M& 
J& Richardson) permit quantitative estimation of the instability 
engendered by reduced crystallite length. The complex morphology of 
polycrystalline homopolymers is necessarily dependent on the same factor. 
Hence, the present studies offer a possible basis for interpretations 
in the latter field. _CONTRACTION OF MUSCLE_- Glycerinated 
muscle, in the presence of the physiological agent. (~ATP) responsible 
for delivering energy to the mechanochemically active proteins 
of muscle, has been shown to undergo a contraction which is highly sensitive 
both to temperature and to solvent composition in mixtures of 
alcohols and water. Experiments carried out over long periods of time 
in order to allow establishment of a steady state have shown that the 
onset of contraction and its completion are confined to an interval of 
several degrees Centigrade and to a concentration range of only several 
per cent. The contraction therefore partakes of the character of 
a phase transition. While ~ATP appears to be necessary for the 
occurrence of contraction, its presence and enzymatic hydrolysis of it 
by the muscle protein myosin are not the only criteria for contraction. 
(C& A& J& Hoeve, P& J& Flory) _ANIONIC POLYMERIZATION_- 
One of the principal aims of anionic polymerization techniques 
is the synthesis of polymers of extremely narrow molecular weight 
distribution. A simple process for the preparation of nearly monodisperse 
polystyrene of predictable molecular weight has been developed. 
The preparation of such products is not new, but the systems heretofore 
employed in polymerizations have commanded considerable experimental 
skill and starting materials of a high purity. In the new process 
impurities present in the solvent (benzene), the monomer, and in the 
reaction system which would cause deactivation of propagation centers, 
are rendered inactive prior to polymerization by gradual addition of 
initiator, a mixture of butyl-lithium and telomeric styryl-lithium, at 
a temperature low enough to suppress chain growth. Upon completion 
of the purging step, additional initiator appropriate for the molecular 
weight of the sample desired is added, and the system is then warmed 
to the polymerization temperature, at which the reaction is allowed 
to go to completion. The predictability of the molecular weights was 
found to be within 10% for the polymers prepared, with **f ratios less 
than 1.1.   Contrary to observations with ethers, no apparent 
change of the reactivity of the chain ends takes place over considerable 
periods of time in benzene as solvent. 
_ORGANIZATION:_ In this publication measurements of interfacial 
angles of crystals are used to classify and identify chemical substances. 
T& V& Barker, who developed the classification-angle system, 
was about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he 
died in 1931. The compilation work was undertaken by a number of interested 
crystallographers in the Department of Mineralogy of the University 
Museum at Oxford. Since 1948 the working headquarters has 
been the 
Department of Geology and Mineralogy. Numerous cooperating individuals 
in Great Britain, Holland, the United States, and Belgium 
have contributed editorially or by making calculations. Great interest 
and practical help have been given by the Barker Index Committee. 
Financial and material help have come from academic, governmental, and 
industrial organizations in England and Holland. Editors for Volumes 
/1, and /2, were M& W& Porter and the late R& C& 
Spiller, both of Oxford University. A third volume remains to be 
published. _SUBSTANCES:_ Volume /1, deals with 2991 compounds 
belonging to the tetragonal, hexagonal and trigonal, and orthorhombic 
systems; and Volume /2,, with about 3500 monoclinic substances. 
Volume /3,, in preparation, will treat the anorthic compounds described 
in Groth's CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE. _PROPERTIES:_ 
The Barker system is based on the use of the smallest number of 
interfacial angles necessary for indexing purposes. Other morphological, 
physical, and optical property values are also given. _SOURCES 
OF DATA:_ The index is essentially a new treatment of previously 
compiled morphological data. Most of the data used are from Groth's 
CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE. _CRITICALITY:_ Every calculation 
has been made independently by two workers and checked by one of 
the editors. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ 
Accepted crystallographic symbolism has been used; other 
symbols related to the index necessarily have been introduced. _CURRENCY:_ 
This publication covers the old literature (Groth); there 
is no mechanism for keeping the volumes up to date. _FORMAT:_ 
The publication form is that of clothbound books. The data are presented 
in lists and tables. Part 1 in both volumes is labeled "Introduction 
and Tables". The tables include those for the classification 
angles, refractive indices, and melting points of the various types 
of crystals. Part 2 of Volume /1, and Parts 2 and 3 of Volume 
/2, contain the crystal descriptions. These are grouped into sections 
according to the crystal system, and within each section compounds 
are arranged in the same order as in Groth's CHEMISCHE KRYSTALLOGRAPHIE. 
An alphabetical list of chemical and mineralogical names 
with reference numbers enables one to find a particular crystal description. 
References to the data sources are given in the crystal descriptions. 
_PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION:_ The BARKER INDEX 
is published for the Barker Index Committee by W& Heffer + Sons, 
Ltd&, 3-4 Petty Cury, Cambridge, England. Volume /1, containing 
Parts 1 and 2 was published in 1951; Volume /2,, in three 
parts, in 1956. The two volumes are available from the publisher 
for $16.80 and $28.00, respectively. #/2,-2. CRYSTAL DATA#

_ORGANIZATION:_ 
The present edition of CRYSTAL DATA was written 
by J&D&H& Donnay, the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, 
Md& (Part /2,) and Werner Nowacki, University of Berne, 
Switzerland (Part /1,) with the collaboration of Gabrielle Donnay, 
U& S& Geological Survey, Washington, D& C&. Many collaborators 
in the United States and Switzerland helped in collecting 
and assembling data, in making calculations, and in editing. Support 
came from academic and industrial groups in these two countries. The 
Geological Society of America gave a grant-in-aid to complete the 
work and bore the expenses of publication. Preparation of a second 
edition is in progress under the sponsorship of the Crystal Data Committee 
of the American Crystallographic Association. Coeditors are 
J&D&H& Donnay, G& E& Cox of Leeds University, and 
Olga Kennard of the National Council for Medical Research, London. 
Financial grants have been received from the National Science 
Foundation and the (British) Institute of Physics for the compilation 
work and the publication costs. The continuity of the project is 
suggested by plans for an eventual third edition. _SUBSTANCES:_ 
Elements, alloys, inorganic and organic compounds. (Metal data will 
not be included in the second edition, since these have been collected 
independently by W& B& Pearson, National Research Council, 
Ottawa, and published as A HANDBOOK OF LATTICE SPACINGS AND STRUCTURES 
OF METALS AND ALLOYS by Pergamon Press.) _PROPERTIES:_ 
Crystallographic data resulting mainly from ~X-ray and electron 
diffraction measurements are presented. Cell dimensions, number of formula 
units per cell, space group, and specific gravity are given for 
all substances. For some substances, auxiliary properties such as the 
melting point are given. _SOURCES OF DATA:_ Part /1, of the 
present edition covers the literature to mid-1948; Part /2,, up 
to the end of 1951. Much of the material comes directly from secondary 
sources such as STRUKTURBERICHT. _CRITICALITY:_ The vast 
number of compounds to be covered, the limited resources to do the job, 
and the immediate need for this type of compilation precluded a thorough 
evaluation of all available data in the present edition. Future 
editions may be more critical. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, 
PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ Since Parts /1, and /2, were prepared 
independently, the abbreviation schemes and the chemical symbols used 
differ in the two parts. The second edition should have greater uniformity. 
_CURRENCY:_ A second edition is in preparation, and there 
are long range plans for a third. _FORMAT:_ Data in the present 
edition are presented in tables and lists. Part /1, deals with 
the classification of crystalline substances by space groups and is 
not a numerical data compilation. The compounds are divided according 
to composition into seven categories. Part /2, contains determinative 
tables for the identification of crystalline substances. These are 
arranged according to crystal system. There are formula and name indexes 
covering both parts. References for Part /1, are given at the 
end and for Part /2, in the tables. _PUBLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION:_ 
The present edition of CRYSTAL DATA (**f), published in 
1954 as Memoir 60 of the Geological Society of America, is now out 
of print. The manuscript of the second edition will probably be ready 
by the end of 1960. #/2,-3. CRYSTAL STRUCTURES#

_ORGANIZATION:_ 
The author of CRYSTAL STRUCTURES is Ralph W&G& 
Wyckoff, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona. The first section 
of this publication appeared in 1948 and the last supplement in 1960. 
Though now complete, the publication is included in this directory 
because of its importance and because of the long-term nature of its 
preparation. _SUBSTANCES:_ Elements, inorganic and organic compounds 
(no alloys). _PROPERTIES:_ The data presented are derived 
almost entirely from ~X-ray diffraction measurements and include 
atomic coordinates, cell dimensions, and atomic and ionic radii. _SOURCES 
OF DATA:_ Published literature. _CRITICALITY:_ The 
aim was to state the results of <all> available determinations of atomic 
positions in crystals. Presumably the tabulated data are best available 
values. The critical comments in the textual sections of this 
publication are invaluable. _USE OF NOMENCLATURE, SYMBOLS, UNITS, 
PHYSICAL CONSTANTS:_ The terminology used conforms to that of INTERNATIONALE 
TABELLEN ZUR BESTIMMUNG VON KRISTALLSTRUKTUREN. _CURRENCY:_
