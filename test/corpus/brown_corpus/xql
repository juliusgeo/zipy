marks and spaces; <Time> magazine reviewed it and suggested that 
the Federation Assembly Daily Record should be translated into 
the medium.   A colossal campaign opened to sell more sexual organs 
of plants and Mrs& Joseph ("Shadow of Greatness") Douglas 
was quoted as saying: "I would no more sit down without flowers 
on my table than without serviettes". A Tibetan swami from Palermo, 
Sicily, announced in Beverly Hills a newly discovered, ancient 
yoga discipline for ripple breathing which increased both pranha and 
cosmic attraction between sexes. His chelas were required to assume 
the 
matsyendra posture dressed in hand-woven diapers while he read aloud 
from Rig-Veda and an assistant guru examined their purses in another 
room- nothing was stolen; the purpose was less immediate.

The President of the United States proclaimed the first Sunday 
in November as "National Grandmothers' Day" and urged America 
to say it with flowers. A funeral parlor chain was indicted for price-cutting. 
Fosterite bishops, after secret conclave, announced the 
Church's second Major Miracle: Supreme Bishop Digby had been 
translated bodily to Heaven and spot-promoted to Archangel, ranking 
with-but-after Archangel Foster. The glorious news had been held up 
pending Heavenly confirmation of the elevation of a new Supreme Bishop, 
Huey Short- a candidate accepted by the Boone faction after 
lots had been cast repeatedly.   <L'Unita> and <Hoy> published 
identical denunciations of Short's elevation, <l'Osservatore 
Romano> and the <Christian Science Monitor> ignored it, 
<Times of India> snickered at it, and the Manchester <Guardian> 
simply reported it- the Fosterites in England were few but extremely 
militant.   Digby was not pleased with his promotion. The 
Man from Mars had interrupted him with his work half finished- and 
that stupid jackass Short was certain to louse it up. Foster listened 
with angelic patience until Digby ran down, then said, "Listen, 
junior, you're an angel now- so forget it. Eternity is no time for 
recriminations. You too were a stupid jackass until you poisoned me. 
Afterwards you did well enough. Now that Short is Supreme Bishop 
he'll do all right, he can't help it. Same as with the Popes. 
Some of them were warts until they got promoted. Check with one of 
them, go ahead- there's no professional jealousy here". 
Digby calmed down, but made one request.   Foster shook his halo. 
"You can't touch him. You shouldn't have tried to. Oh, you 
can submit a requisition for a miracle if you want to make a fool of 
yourself. But, I'm telling you, it'll be turned down- you don't 
understand the System yet. The Martians have their own setup, different 
from ours, and as long as they need him, we can't touch him. 
They run their show their way- the Universe has variety, something 
for everybody- a fact you field workers often miss".   "You 
mean this punk can brush me aside and I've got to hold still for 
it"?   "I held still for the same thing, didn't I? 
I'm helping you now, am I not? Now look, there's work to be 
done and lots of it. The Boss wants performance, not gripes. If you 
need a Day off to calm down, duck over to the Muslim Paradise and 
take it. Otherwise, straighten your halo, square your wings, and dig 
in. The sooner you act like an angel the quicker you'll feel angelic. 
Get Happy, junior"!   Digby heaved a deep ethereal sigh. 
"Okay, I'm Happy. Where do I start"?   Jubal did 
not hear of Digby's disappearance when it was announced, and, when 
he did, while he had a fleeting suspicion, he dismissed it; if Mike 
had had a finger in it, he had gotten away with it- and what happened 
to supreme bishops worried Jubal not at all as long as he wasn't 
bothered.   His household had gone through an upset. Jubal deduced 
what had happened but did not know with whom- and didn't want 
to inquire. Mike was of legal age and presumed able to defend himself 
in the clinches. Anyhow, it was high time the boy was salted.

Jubal couldn't reconstruct the crime from the way the girls behaved 
because patterns kept shifting- ~ABC ~<vs> ~D, then ~BCD 
~<vs> ~A **h or ~AB ~<vs> ~CD, or ~AD 
~<vs> 
~CB, through all ways that four women can gang up on each 
other.   This continued most of the week following that ill-starred 
trip to church, during which period Mike stayed in his room and usually 
in a trance so deep that Jubal would have pronounced him dead 
had he not seen it before. Jubal would not have minded it if service 
had not gone to pieces. The girls seemed to spend half their time tiptoeing 
in "to see if Mike was all right" and they were too preoccupied 
to cook, much less be secretaries. Even rock-steady Anne- Hell, 
Anne was the worst! Absent-minded, subject to unexplained tears 
**h Jubal would have bet his life that if Anne were to witness the 
Second Coming, she would memorize date, time, personae, events, and 
barometric pressure without batting her calm blue eyes. 
The expense and time involved are astronomical. However, we sent a third 
vessel out, a much smaller and faster one than the first two. We 
have learned much about interstellar drives since a hundred years ago; 
that is all I can tell you about them.   "But the third ship 
came back several years ago and reported **h"   "That it 
had found a planet on which human beings could live and which was already 
inhabited by sentient beings"! said Hal, forgetting in his enthusiasm 
that he had not been asked to speak.   Macneff stopped 
pacing to stare at Hal with his pale blue eyes.   "How did you 
know"? he said sharply.   "Forgive me, Sandalphon", 
said Hal. "But it was inevitable! Did not the Forerunner predict 
in his <Time and the World Line> that such a planet would be found? 
I believe it was on page 573"!   Macneff smiled and 
said, "I am glad that your scriptural lessons have left such an impression".

How could they not? thought Hal. Besides, they 
were not the only impressions. I still bear scars on my back where 
Pornsen, my <gapt>, whipped me because I had not learned my lessons 
well enough. He was a good impresser, that Pornsen. Was? Is! 
As I 
grew older and was promoted, so was he, always where I was. He was 
my <gapt> in the creche. He was the dormitory <gapt> when I went 
to college and thought I was getting away from him. He is now my block 
<gapt>. He is the one responsible for my getting such low M& 
R&'s.   Swiftly, came the revulsion, the protest. No, not 
he, for I, and I alone, am responsible for whatever happens to me. 
If I get a low M& R&, I do so because I want it that way or 
my dark self does. If I die, I die because I willed it so. So, forgive 
me, Sigmen, for the contrary-to-reality thoughts!   "Please 
pardon me again, Sandalphon", said Hal. "But did the expedition 
find any records of the Forerunner having been on this planet? 
Perhaps, even, though this is too much to wish, find the Forerunner 
himself"?   "No", said Macneff. "Though that does 
not mean that there may not be such records there. The expedition 
was under orders to make a swift survey of conditions and then to return 
to Earth. I can't tell you now the distance in lightyears or what 
star this was, though you can see it with the naked eye at night in 
this hemisphere. If you volunteer, you will be told where you're going 
after the ship leaves. And it leaves very soon".   "You 
need a linguist"? said Hal.   "The ship is huge", said 
Macneff, "but the number of military men and specialists we are taking 
limits the linguists to one. We have considered several of your 
professionals because they were <lamechians> and above suspicion. Unfortunately 
**h"   Hal waited: Macneff paced some more, frowning. 
Then, he said, "Unfortunately, only one <lamechian> linguist 
exists, and he is too old for this expedition. Therefore **h"

"A thousand pardons", said Hal. "But I have just thought 
of one thing. I am married".   "No problem at all", 
said Macneff. "There will be no women aboard the <Gabriel>. And, 
if a man is married, he will automatically be given a divorce".

Hal gasped, and he said, "A divorce"?   Macneff raised 
his hands apologetically and said, "You are horrified, of course. 
But, from our reading of the <Western Talmud>, we Urielites 
believe that the Forerunner, knowing this situation would arise, made 
reference to and provision for divorce. It's inevitable in this case, 
for the couple will be separated for, at the least, forty years. Naturally, 
he couched the provision in obscure language. In his great 
and glorious wisdom, he knew that our enemies the Israelites must not 
be able to read therein what we planned".   "I volunteer", 
said Hal. "Tell me more, Sandalphon". ##

Six months later, 
Hal Yarrow stood in the observation dome of the <Gabriel> and 
watched the ball of Earth dwindle above him. It was night on this hemisphere, 
but the light blazed from the megalopolises of Australia, 
Japan, China, Southeast Asia, India, Siberia. Hal, the linguist, 
saw the glittering discs and necklaces in terms of the languages spoken 
therein. Australia, the Philippine Islands, Japan, and northern 
China were inhabited by those members of the Haijac Union that spoke 
American.   Southern China, all of southeast Asia, southern 
India and Ceylon, these states of the Malay Federation spoke Bazaar.

Siberia spoke Icelandic.   His mind turned the globe 
swiftly for him, and he visualized Africa, which used Swahili south 
of the Sahara Sea. All around the Mediterranean Sea, Asia Minor, 
northern India, and Tibet, Hebrew was the native tongue. In 
southern Europe, between the Israeli Republics and the Icelandic-speaking 
peoples of northern Europe, was a thin but long stretch of territory 
called March. This was no man's land, disputed by the Haijac 
Union and the Israeli Republic, a potential source of war for 
the last two hundred years. Neither nation would give up their claim 
on it, yet neither wished to make any move that might lead to a second 
Apocalyptic War. So, for all practical purposes, it was an independent 
nation and by now had its own organized government (unrecognized 
outside its own borders). Its citizens spoke all of the world's surviving 
tongues, plus a new one called Lingo, a pidgin whose vocabulary 
was derived from the other six and whose syntax was so simple it could 
be contained on half a sheet of paper.   Hal saw in his mind 
the rest of Earth: Iceland, Greenland, the Caribbean Islands, 
and the eastern half of South America. Here the peoples spoke the tongue 
of Iceland because that island had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian-Americans 
who were busy resettling North America and the western 
half of South America after the Apocalyptic War.   Then 
there was North America, where American was the native speech of all 
except the twenty descendants of French-Canadians living on the Hudson 
Bay Preserve.   Hal knew that when that side of Earth 
rotated into the night zone, Sigmen City would blaze out into space. 
And, somewhere in that enormous light, was his apartment. But Mary 
would soon no longer be living there, for she would be notified in a 
few days that her husband had died in an accident while on a flight to 
Tahiti. She would weep in private, he was sure, for she loved him 
in her frigid way, though in public she would be dry-eyed. Her friends 
and professional associates would sympathize with her, not because she 
had lost a beloved husband, but because she had been married to a man 
who thought unrealistically. If Hal Yarrow had been killed in a 
crash, he must have wanted it that way. There was no such thing as an 
"accident". Somehow, all the other passengers (also supposed to 
have died in this web of elaborate frauds to cover up the disappearance 
of the personnel of the <Gabriel>) had simultaneously "agreed" 
to die. And, therefore, being in disgrace, they would not be cremated 
and their ashes flung to the winds in public ceremony. No, the fish 
could eat their bodies for all the Sturch cared.   Hal felt 
sorry for Mary; he had a time keeping the tears from welling to his 
own eyes as he stood in the crowd in the observation dome.   Yet, 
he told himself, this was the best way. He and Mary would no longer 
have to tear and rend at each other; their mutual torture would be 
over. Mary was free to marry again, not knowing that the Sturch had 
secretly given her a divorce, thinking that death had dissolved her
