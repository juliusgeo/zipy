the hydrogen atoms to occupy general, rather than special, positions 
along the [111] axis.   If the **f bond is linear then there 
are three reasonable positions for the hydrogen atoms: (1) The hydrogen 
atoms are centered and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the 
oxygen sheets; (2) all hydrogen atoms lie on a sheet, but the sheet 
is closer to one oxygen sheet than to the other; (3) hydrogen atoms 
are asymmetrically placed, either randomly or in an ordered way, so 
that some hydrogen atoms are closer to the upper oxygen atoms while others 
are closer to the lower oxygen atoms. Position (2) appears to us 
to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on 
general chemical structural grounds. A randomization of "ups" and 
"downs" is more likely than ordered "ups" and "downs" in 
position (3) since the hydrogen atoms are well separated and so the 
position of one could hardly affect the position of another, and also 
since ordered "up" and "down" implies a larger unit cell, for 
which no evidence exists. Therefore, the only unknown structural feature 
would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms are located symmetrically 
(1) or asymmetrically (3). 

#EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES#

_SAMPLES_ 
Douglass prepared his sample of **f by thermal decomposition of 
aqueous chromic acid at 300-325`~C. Dr& Douglass was kind enough 
to lend us about 5 grams of his material. This material proved 
to be unsatisfactory, since we could not obtain reproducible results on 
various portions of the sample. Subsequently, we learned from Douglass 
that his sample contained a few percent **f impurity. Since **f 
is ferromagnetic, we felt that any results obtained from the magnetically 
contaminated **f would be suspect.   Plane suggested another 
preparation of **f which we used here. 500 ~ml of 1~<M> aqueous 
**f 
with 1 ~g **f added are heated in a bomb at 170`~C for 48 hours. 
A very fine, gray solid (about 15 ~g) is formed, water-washed 
by centrifugation, and dried at 110`~C.   Differential thermal 
analysis showed a very small endothermic reaction at 340`~C and 
a large endothermic reaction at 470`~C. This latter reaction is 
in accord with the reported decomposition of **f. Thermogravimetric analysis 
showed a weight loss of 1.8% centered at 337`~C and another 
weight loss of 10.8% at 463`~C. The expected weight loss for 
**f going to **f and **f is 10.6%. Mass spectrometric analysis of 
gases evolved upon heating to 410`~C indicated nitrogen oxides 
and water vapor. The small reaction occurring at 337`~C is probably 
caused by decomposition of occluded nitrates, and perhaps by a small 
amount of some hydrous material other than **f. All subsequent measurements 
were made on material which had been heated to 375`~C for 
one hour. Emission spectra indicated **f calcium and all other impurities 
much lower. Chromium analysis gave 58.8% ~Cr as compared 
with 61.2% theory. However, **f adsorbs water from the atmosphere and 
this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight 
loss.   The x-ray diffraction pattern of the material, taken with 
~CuK|a radiation, indicated the presence of no extra lines and 
was in good agreement with the pattern of Douglass. Magnetic analyses 
by R& G& Meisenheimer of this laboratory indicated no ferromagnetic 
impurities. **f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired 
electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of **f, 
where **f. For exactly three unpaired electrons the coefficient would 
be 3.10. An infrared spectrum, obtained by H& A& Benesi and 
R& G& Snyder of this laboratory, showed bands in the positions 
found by Jones.   Electron microscopic examination of the **f 
sample showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles about 0.3|m 
in diameter. The particles appeared rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal 
domains are smaller than this. The x-ray data are consistent 
with particle sizes of 1000 ~A or greater. We found no obvious 
effects due to preferred orientation of the crystallites in this sample 
nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape found from electron 
microscopic examination. 

#NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (~NMR) 
MEASUREMENTS# 

The magnetic resonance absorption was detected by employing 
a Varian model **f broad line spectrometer and the associated 12-inch 
electromagnet system. One measurement at 40 ~Mc/sec was obtained 
with the Varian model **f unit. A bridged-<T> type of bridge was 
used in the 10-16 ~Mc/sec range. The ~rf power level was maintained 
small enough at all times to prevent obvious line shape distortions 
by saturation effects. A modulation frequency of 40 ~cps with an 
amplitude as small as possible, commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise 
quality, was used. Background spectra were obtained in 
all cases. The spectrometer was adjusted to minimize the amount of dispersion 
mode mixed in with the absorption signal.   A single value 
of the thermal relaxation time **f at room temperature was measured 
by the progressive saturation method. The value of **f estimated at 
470 gauss was **f microseconds. A single measurement of the spin-spin 
relaxation time **f was obtained at 10 ~Mc/sec by pulse methods. 
This measurement was obtained by W& Blumberg of the University of 
California, Berkeley, by observing the breadth of the free induction 
decay signal. The value derived was 16 microseconds.   Field 
shifts were derived from the mean value of the resonance line, defined 
as the field about which the first moment is zero.   Second moments 
of the spectra were computed by numerical integration. Corrections 
were applied for modulation broadening, apparatus background, and 
field shift.   Spectra were obtained over the temperature range 
of 77-294`K. For the low-temperature measurements the sample was 
cooled 
by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of Andrew and 
Eades. The temperature was maintained to within about **f for the 
period of time required to make the measurement (usually about one hour). 
One sample, which had been exposed to the atmosphere after evacuation 
at 375`~C, showed the presence of adsorbed water (about 0.3 
~wt %) as evidenced by a weak resonance line which was very narrow 
at room temperature and which disappeared, due to broadening, at low 
temperature. The data reported here are either from spectra from which 
the adsorbed water resonance could easily be eliminated or from spectra 
of samples evacuated and sealed off at 375`~C which contain no 
adsorbed water.   The measured powder density of the **f used 
here was about **f, approximately one-third that of the crystal density 
(**f). Such a density corresponds to a paramagnetic ion density of 
about **f.   Spectra were obtained from a powdered sample having 
the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio 
of 4:1. The top of the sample was nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical. 
Spectra were also obtained from a sample in a spherical container 
which was made by blowing a bubble on the end of a capillary glass 
tube. The bubble was filled to the top and special precautions were 
taken to prevent any sample from remaining in the capillary. Spectra 
were also obtained from a third sample of **f which had been diluted 
to three times its original volume with powdered, anhydrous alundum 
(**f). This sample was contained in a cylindrical container similar to 
that described above. 
Polyphosphates gave renewed life to soap products at a time when surfactants 
were a threat though expensive, and these same polyphosphates 
spelled the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphates 
and synthetic detergent actives was recognized and exploited.

The market today for detergent builders is quite diverse. The best 
known field of application for builders is in heavy-duty, spray-dried 
detergent formulations for household use. These widely advertised 
products, which are used primarily for washing clothes, are based on 
high-sudsing, 
synthetic organic actives (sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates) 
and contain up to 50% by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture 
of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate. In the 
household market, there are also low-sudsing detergent formulations 
based on nonionic actives with about the same amount of phosphate builder; 
light-duty synthetic detergents with much less builder; and the 
dwindling built-soap powders as well as soap flakes and granules, none 
of which are now nationally advertised. A well-publicized entrant 
which has achieved success only recently is the built liquid detergent, 
with which the major problem today is incorporation of builder and 
active into a small volume using a sufficiently high builder/active 
ratio.   Hard-surface cleaning in household application is 
represented by two classes of alkaline products: (1) the formulations 
made expressly for machine dishwashers, and (2) the general-purpose 
cleaners used for walls and woodwork. The better quality products in 
both of these lines contain phosphate builders. In addition, many of 
the hard-surface cleaners used for walls and woodwork had their genesis 
in trisodium orthophosphate, which is still the major ingredient of 
a number of such products. Many scouring powders now also contain phosphates. 
These hard-surface cleaners are discussed in Chapter 28. 

#THE 
CLEANING PROCESS#

Cleaning or detergent action is entirely 
a matter of surfaces. Wet cleaning involves an aqueous medium, a solid 
substrate, soil to be removed, and the detergent or surface-active 
material. An oversimplified differentiation between soft- and hard-surface 
cleaning lies in the magnitude and kind of surface involved. One 
gram of cotton has been found to have a specific surface area of **f. 
In contrast, a metal coupon **f in size would have a magnitude from 
100,000 to a million less. Even here there is room for some variation, 
for metal surfaces vary in smoothness, absorptive capacity, and chemical 
reactivity. Spring used a Brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning 
study and showed considerable differences in soil removal, depending 
upon surface roughness. There are considerable differences between 
the requirements for textile and hard-surface cleaning. Exclusive 
of esthetic values, such as high- or low-foam level, perfume content, 
etc&, the requirements for the organic active used in washing textiles 
are high. No matter how they are formulated, a large number of organic 
actives are simply not suitable for this application, since they 
do not give adequate soil removal. This is best demonstrated by practical 
washing tests in which cloth articles are repeatedly washed with 
the same detergent formulation. A good formulation will keep the clothes 
clean and white after many washings; whereas, with a poor formulation, 
the clothes exhibit a build-up of "tattle-tale grey" and dirty 
spots- sometimes with bad results even after the first wash. Since 
practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive, a number 
of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation 
of detergents. Harris has indicated that two devices, the Launder-Ometer 
and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent 
testing, and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled 
fabrics. Also given are several laboratory wash procedures in general 
use. The soiled fabrics used for rapid testing of detergent formulations 
are made in such a way that only part of the soil is removed by 
even the best detergent formulation in a single wash. In this way, 
numerical values for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulations 
can be obtained by measuring the reflectance (whiteness) of the 
cloth swatches before and after washing. Soil redeposition is evaluated 
by washing clean swatches with the dirty ones. As is the case with 
the surface-active agent, the requirements for builders to be used in 
detergent compositions for washing textiles are also high. Large numbers 
of potential builders have been investigated, but none have been 
found to be as effective as the polyphosphates over the relatively wide 
range of conditions met in practice.   The problems of hard-surface 
cleaning are not nearly as complex. In hard-surface cleaning, the 
inorganic salts are more important than the organic active. Indeed, 
when the proper inorganic constituents are employed, practically any 
wetting or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present 
in sufficient amount in a hard-surface cleaning formulation. Hydroxides,
