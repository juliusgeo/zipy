marriage. She would have a year in which to make up her mind, to choose 
a mate from a list selected by her <gapt>. Perhaps, the psychological 
barriers that had prevented her from conceiving Hal's child would 
no longer be present. Perhaps. Hal doubted if this happy event 
would occur. Mary was as frozen below the navel as he. No matter who 
the candidate for marriage selected by the <gapt> **h   The 
<gapt>. Pornsen. He would no longer have to see that fat face, hear 
that whining voice **h   "Hal Yarrow"! said the whining 
voice.   And, slowly, feeling himself icy yet burning, Hal turned.

There was the squat loose-jowled man, smiling lopsidedly 
up at him.   "My beloved ward, my perennial gadfly", said the 
whining voice. "I had no idea that you, too, would be on this glorious 
voyage. But I might have known! We seem to be bound by love; 
Sigmen himself must have foreseen it. Love to you, my ward".

"Sigmen love you, too, my guardian", said Hal, choking. "How 
wonderful to see your cherished self. I had thought we would never 
again speak to each other".

THE <Gabriel> pointed 
towards her destination and, under one-gee acceleration, began to build 
up towards her ultimate velocity, 99.1 percent of the speed of light. 
Meanwhile, all the personnel except those few needed to carry out 
the performance of the ship, went into the suspensor. Here they would 
lie in suspended animation for many years. Some time later, after 
a check had been made of all automatic equipment, the crew would join 
the others. They would sleep while the <Gabriel's> drive would increase 
the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen bodies of the personnel 
could not have endured. Upon reaching the desired speed, the 
automatic equipment would cut off the drive, and the silent but not empty 
vessel would hurl towards the star which was its journey's end.

Many years later, the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of 
the ship would determine that the star was close enough to actuate deceleration. 
Again, a force too strong for unfrozen bodies to endure 
would be applied. Then, after slowing the vessel considerably, the drive 
would adjust to a one-gee deceleration. And the crew would be automatically 
brought out of their suspended animation. These members would 
then unthaw the rest of the personnel. And, in the half-year left 
before reaching their destination, the men would carry out whatever 
preparations were needed.   Hal Yarrow was among the last to go 
into the suspensor and among the first to come out. He had to study 
the recordings of the language of the chief nation of Ozagen, Siddo. 
And, from the first, he faced a difficult task. The expedition that 
had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand Siddo 
words with an equal number of American words. The description of 
the Siddo syntax was very restricted. And, as Hal found out, obviously 
mistaken in many cases.

This discovery caused Hal anxiety. 
His duty was to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel 
of the <Gabriel> how to speak Ozagen. Yet, if he used all of the 
little means at his disposal, he would be instructing his students 
wrongly. Moreover, even getting this across would be difficult.

For one thing, the organs of speech of the Ozagen natives differed 
somewhat from Earthmen's; the sounds made by these organs were, 
therefore, dissimilar. It was true that they could be approximated, 
but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations?   Another 
obstacle was the grammatical construction of Siddo. Consider 
the tense system. Instead of inflecting a verb or using an unattached 
particle to indicate the past or future, Siddo used an entirely different 
word. Thus, the masculine animate infinitive <dabhumaksanigalu'ahai,> 
meaning <to live>, was, in the perfect tense, <ksu'u'peli'afo>, 
and, in the future, <mai'teipa>. The same use of 
an entirely different word applied for all the other tenses. Plus the 
fact that Siddo not only had the normal (to Earthmen) three genders 
of masculine, feminine, and neuter, but the two extra of inanimate and 
spiritual. Fortunately, gender was inflected, though the expression 
of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo. The system 
of indicating gender varied according to tense.   All the other 
parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and conjunctions 
operated under the same system as the verbs. 
This was not, for the Angel, just a matter of running through a logical 
or deductive chain, or deciding on some action from some already 
established premise. No doubt the Angels could do that kind of thing 
as fast as any computer.   What Gabriel was being asked to do 
now, however, was to re-examine all his basic assumptions, make value-judgments 
on them, and give them new and different powers in his mind 
to govern his motives. This is not wholly a reasoning process- a computer 
cannot do it all- and even in an Angel it takes time. (Or, 
perhaps, <especially> in an Angel, whose assumptions had mostly been 
fixed millions of years ago.)   Being reasonably sure of the 
reason for the long pause, however, did not make it seem any less long 
to Jack. He had already become used to Hesperus' snapping back answers 
to questions almost before Jack could get them asked.   There 
was nothing he could do but wait. The dice were cast.   At 
last Gabriel spoke.   "We misjudged you", he said slowly. 
"We had concluded that no race as ephemeral as yours could have had 
time to develop a sense of justice. Of course we have before us the 
example of the great races at the galactic center; individually they 
are nearly as mortal as you- the difference does not seem very marked 
to us, where it exists. But they have survived for long periods <as 
races>, whereas you are young. We shall recommend to them that 
they shorten your trial period by half.   "For now, it is clear 
that we were in the wrong. You may reclaim your property, and the 
penalty on Hesperus is lifted. Hesperus, you may speak".   "I 
did not perceive this essential distinction either, First-Born", 
Hesperus said at once, "I was only practicing a concept that Jack 
taught me, called a deal".   "Nevertheless, you were its 
agent. Jack, what is the nature of this concept"?   "It's 
a kind of agreement in which each party gives something to the other", 
Jack said. "We regard it as fair only when each party feels 
that what he has received is as valuable, or more valuable, than what 
he has given". His heart, he discovered, was pounding. "For 
instance, Hesperus agreed to help me find my property, and I agreed 
to take him to Earth. Between individuals, this process is called 
bargaining. When it is done between races or nations, it is called 
making a treaty. And the major part of my mission to your nest is to 
make a treaty between your race and mine. Recovering the property was 
much less important".   "Strange", Gabriel said. "And 
apparently impossible. Though it might be that we would have much to 
give you, you have nothing to give us".   "Hesperus and Lucifer", 
Jack said, "show that we do".   Another pause; 
but this one was not nearly as long.   "Then it is a matter of 
pleasure; of curiosity; of a more alive time. Yes, those could 
be commodities under this concept. But you should understand, Jack, 
that Hesperus and Lucifer are not long out of the nursery. Visiting 
the Earth would not be an offering of worth to those of us who are older".

This explained a great deal. "All the more reason, 
then", Jack said, "why we must have a treaty. We will gladly entertain 
your young and give them proper living quarters, in return for 
their help in running our fusion reactors. But we must know if this 
is in accordance with your customs, and must have your agreement they 
will not misuse the power we put in their hands, to our hurt".

"But this simply requires that they behave in accordance with the 
dictates of their own natures, and respect yours in turn. To this 
we 
of course agree".   Jack felt a wave of complete elation, but 
in a second it had vanished without a trace. What Gabriel was asking 
was that mankind forego all its parochial moral judgments, and contract 
to let the Angels serve on Earth as it is in Heaven <regardless> 
of the applicable Earth laws. The Angels in turn would exercise 
similar restraints in respect for the natural preferences and natures 
of the Earthmen- but they had no faintest notion of man's perverse 
habit of passing and enforcing laws which were contrary to his own 
preferences and violations of his nature.   The simple treaty principle 
that Gabriel was asking him to ratify, in short, was nothing 
less than total trust.   Nothing less would serve. And it might 
be, considering the uncomfortable custom the Angels had of thinking 
of everything in terms of absolutes, that the proposal of anything less 
might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war.

Furthermore, even the highly trained law clerk who was a part of 
Jack's total make-up could not understand how the principle could 
ever be codified. Almost the whole experience of mankind pointed toward 
suspicion, not trust, as the safest and sanest attitude toward all 
outsiders.   Yet there was some precedent for it. The history of 
disarmament agreements, for instance, had been unreassuringly dismal; 
but the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 
nevertheless did eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban, and 
a sort of provisional acceptance of each other's good intentions on 
this limited question. Out of that agreement, though not by any easy 
road, eventually emerged the present world hegemony of the United Nations; 
suspicion between member states still existed, but it was of 
about the same low order of virulence as the twentieth-century rivalry 
between Arizona and California over water supplies.   Besides, 
agreements "in principle", with the petty details to be thrashed 
out later, were commonplace in diplomatic history. The trouble with 
them was that they almost never worked, and in fact an agreement "in 
principle" historically turned out to be a sure sign that neither 
party really wanted the quarrel settled.   Suppose that this one 
were to work? There was no question in Jack's mind of the good 
faith on one side, at least. If mankind could be convinced of that **h

It was worth trying. In fact, it had to be tried. It would 
be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that Earth had 
ever signed. Secretary Hart had taught Jack, at least partially, to 
be content with small beginnings in all diplomatic matters; but there 
was no small way to handle this one.   He turned back to the 
screens, the crucial, conclusive phrase on his lips. But he was too late. 
He had lost his audience. ##

For a moment he could make no 
sense at all of what he saw. It seemed to be only a riot of color, light 
and meaningless activity. Gradually, he realized that the pentagon 
of Angel elders had vanished, and that the ritual learning dance of 
the nursery had been broken up. The Angels in the nursery were zigzagging 
wildly in all directions, seemingly at random.   "Hesperus! 
What's going on here? What's happened"?   "Your 
brothers have been found. They are on their way here". 
"Where? I don't see them. The instruments don't show them".

"You can't see them yet, Jack. They'll be in range 
in a short while".   Jack scanned the skies, the boards, and 
the skies again. Nothing. No- there was a tiny pip on the radar; 
and it was getting bigger rapidly. If that was the skiff, it was making 
unprecedented speed.   Then the skiff hove into sight, just 
a dot of light at first against the roiling blackness and crimson streaks 
of the Coal Sack. Through the telescope, Jack could see that 
both spacesuits were still attached to it. The sail was still unfurled, 
though there were a good many holes in it, as Langer had predicted 
would be the case by now.   It was a startling, almost numenous 
sight; but even more awesome was the fact that it was trailing an 
enormous comet's-tail of Angels.   The skiff was not heading
