Ekstrohm never slept. Some doctors had informed him he 
was mistaken about this. Actually, they said, he did sleep, but so shortly 
and fitfully that he forgot. Others admitted he was absolutely 
correct- he <never> slept. His body processes only slowed down enough 
for him to dispell fatigue poisons. Occasionally he fell into a 
waking, gritty-eyed stupor; but he never slept.   Never at all.

Naturally, he couldn't let his shipmates know this. Insomnia 
would ground him from the Exploration Service, on physiological 
if not psychological grounds. He had to hide it. ##

OVER the 
years, he had had buddies in space in whom he thought he could confide. 
The buddies invariably took advantage of him. Since he couldn't 
sleep anyway, he might as well stand their watches for them or write 
their reports. Where the hell did he get off threatening to report 
any laxness on their part to the captain? A man with insomnia had 
better avoid bad dreams of that kind if he knew what was good for him.

Ekstrohm had to hide his secret.   In a camp, instead of 
shipboard, hiding the secret was easier. But the secret itself was 
just as hard.   Ekstrohm picked up a lightweight no-back from the 
ship's library, a book by Bloch, the famous twentieth century expert 
on sex. He scanned a few lines on the social repercussions of a celebrated 
nineteenth century sex murderer, but he couldn't seem to concentrate 
on the weighty, pontifical, ponderous style.   On impulse, 
he flipped up the heat control on his coverall and slid back the 
hatch of the bubble.   Ekstrohm walked through the alien glass 
and looked up at the unfamiliar constellations, smelling the frozen sterility 
of the thin air.   Behind him, his mates stirred without 
waking. #/2,#

EKSTROHM was startled in the morning by a 
banging on the hatch of his bubble. It took him a few seconds to put 
his thoughts in order, and then he got up from the bunk where he had been 
resting, sleeplessly.   The angry burnt-red face of Ryan greeted 
him. "Okay, Stormy, this isn't the place for fun and games. 
What did you do with them"?   "Do with what"?

"The dead beasties. All the dead animals laying around the ship".

"What are you talking about, Ryan? What do you think I 
did with them"?   "I don't know. All I know is that they 
are gone".   <"Gone"?>   Ekstrohm shouldered 
his way outside and scanned the veldt.   There was no ring of animal 
corpses. Nothing. Nothing but wispy grass whipping in the keen 
breeze.   "I'll be damned", Ekstrohm said.   "You 
are right now, buddy. ExPe doesn't like anybody mucking up primary 
evidence".   "Where do you get off, Ryan"? Ekstrohm 
demanded. "Why pick me for your patsy? This has got to be some 
kind of local phenomenon. Why accuse a shipmate of being behind this"?

"Listen, Ekstrohm, I want to give you the benefit of 
every doubt. But you aren't exactly the model of a surveyor, you know. 
You've been riding on a pink ticket for six years, you know that".

"No", Ekstrohm said, "No, I didn't know that".

"You've been hiding things from me and Nogol every jump 
we've made with you. Now comes this! It fits the pattern of secrecy 
and stealth you've been involved in".   "What could I 
do with your lousy dead bodies? What would I want with them"?

"All I know is that you were outside the bubbles last night, 
and you were the only sentient being who came in or out of our alarm 
web. The tapes show that. Now all the bodies are missing, like they 
got up and walked away".   It was not a new experience to Ekstrohm. 
No. Suspicion wasn't new to him at all.   "Ryan, 
there are other explanations for the disappearance of the bodies. Look 
for them, will you? I give you my word I'm not trying to pull 
some stupid kind of joke, or to deliberately foul up the expedition. 
Take my word, can't you"?   Ryan shook his head. "I don't 
think I can. There's still such a thing as mental illness. You 
may not be responsible".   Ekstrohm scowled.   "Don't 
try anything violent, Stormy. I outweigh you fifty pounds and 
I'm fast for a big man".   "I wasn't planning on jumping 
you. Why do you have to jump me the first time something goes wrong?

She lived and was given a name. Helva. For her first three vegetable 
months she waved her crabbed claws, kicked weakly with her clubbed 
feet and enjoyed the usual routine of the infant. She was not alone 
for there were three other such children in the big city's special 
nursery. Soon they all were removed to Central Laboratory School 
where their delicate transformation began.   One of the babies 
died in the initial transferral but of Helva's "class", seventeen 
thrived in the metal shells. Instead of kicking feet, Helva's 
neural responses started her wheels; instead of grabbing with hands, 
she manipulated mechanical extensions. As she matured, more and more 
neural synapses would be adjusted to operate other mechanisms that went 
into the maintenance and running of a space ship. For Helva was 
destined to be the "brain" half of a scout ship, partnered with a 
man or a woman, whichever she chose, as the mobile half. She would be 
among the elite of her kind. Her initial intelligence tests registered 
above normal and her adaptation index was unusually high. As long 
as her development within her shell lived up to expectations, and there 
were no side-effects from the pituitary tinkering, Helva would live 
a rewarding, rich and unusual life, a far cry from what she would have 
faced as an ordinary, "normal" being.   However, no diagram 
of her brain patterns, no early I&Q& tests recorded certain essential 
facts about Helva that Central must eventually learn. They 
would have to bide their official time and see, trusting that the massive 
doses of shell-psychology would suffice her, too, as the necessary 
bulwark against her unusual confinement and the pressures of her profession. 
A ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with 
the power and resources Central had to build into their scout ships. 
Brain ships were, of course, long past the experimental stages. Most 
babes survived the techniques of pituitary manipulation that kept 
their bodies small, eliminating the necessity of transfers from smaller 
to larger shells. And very, very few were lost when the final connection 
was made to the control panels of ship or industrial combine. Shell 
people resembled mature dwarfs in size whatever their natal deformities 
were, but the well-oriented brain would not have changed places 
with the most perfect body in the Universe.   So, for happy years, 
Helva scooted around in her shell with her classmates, playing such 
games as Stall, Power-Seek, studying her lessons in trajectory, 
propulsion techniques, computation, logistics, mental hygiene, basic 
alien psychology, philology, space history, law, traffic, codes: all 
the et ceteras that eventually became compounded into a reasoning, logical, 
informed citizen. Not so obvious to her, but of more importance 
to her teachers, Helva ingested the precepts of her conditioning as 
easily as she absorbed her nutrient fluid. She would one day be grateful 
to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction.

Helva's civilization was not without busy, do-good associations, 
exploring possible inhumanities to terrestrial as well as extraterrestrial 
citizens. One such group got all incensed over shelled "children" 
when Helva was just turning fourteen. When they were forced 
to, Central Worlds shrugged its shoulders, arranged a tour of the Laboratory 
Schools and set the tour off to a big start by showing the 
members case histories, complete with photographs. Very few committees 
ever looked past the first few photos. Most of their original objections 
about "shells" were overridden by the relief that these hideous 
(to them) bodies <were> mercifully concealed.   Helva's 
class was doing Fine Arts, a selective subject in her crowded program. 
She had activated one of her microscopic tools which she would later 
use for minute repairs to various parts of her control panel. Her 
subject 
was large- a copy of the Last Supper- and her canvas, small- 
the head of a tiny screw. She had tuned her sight to the proper 
degree. As she worked she absentmindedly crooned, producing a curious 
sound. Shell people used their own vocal cords and diaphragms but sound 
issued through microphones rather than mouths. Helva's hum then 
had a curious vibrancy, a warm, dulcet quality even in its aimless chromatic 
wanderings.   "Why, what a lovely voice you have", 
said one of the female visitors.   Helva "looked" up and caught 
a fascinating panorama of regular, dirty craters on a flaky pink surface. 
Her hum became a gurgle of surprise. She instinctively regulated 
her "sight" until the skin lost its cratered look and the pores 
assumed normal proportions.   "Yes, we have quite a few years 
of voice training, madam", remarked Helva calmly. "Vocal peculiarities 
often become excessively irritating during prolonged intra-stellar 
distances and must be eliminated. I enjoyed my lessons".

Although this was the first time that Helva had seen unshelled 
people, she took this experience calmly. Any other reaction would have 
been reported instantly.   "I meant that you have a nice singing 
voice **h dear", the lady amended.   "Thank you. Would 
you like to see my work"? Helva asked, politely. She instinctively 
sheered away from personal discussions but she filed the comment away 
for further meditation.   "Work"? asked the lady.

"I am currently reproducing the Last Supper on the head of a screw".

"O, I say", the lady twittered.   Helva turned 
her vision back to magnification and surveyed her copy critically.

"Of course, some of my color values do not match the old Master's 
and the perspective is faulty but I believe it to be a fair 
copy".   The lady's eyes, unmagnified, bugged out. 
"Oh, I forget", and Helva's voice was really contrite. If she 
could have blushed, she would have. "You people don't have adjustable 
vision".   The monitor of this discourse grinned with pride 
and amusement as Helva's tone indicated pity for the unfortunate.

"Here, this will help", suggested Helva, substituting 
a magnifying device in one extension and holding it over the picture.

In a kind of shock, the ladies and gentlemen of the committee 
bent to observe the incredibly copied and brilliantly executed Last 
Supper on the head of a screw.   "Well", remarked one gentleman 
who had been forced to accompany his wife, "the good Lord can 
eat where angels fear to tread".   "Are you referring, sir", 
asked Helva politely, "to the Dark Age discussions of the number 
of angels who could stand on the head of a pin"?   "I had 
that in mind".   "If you substitute 'atom' for 'angel', 
the problem is not insoluble, given the metallic content of the 
pin in question".   "Which you are programed to compute"?

"Of course".   "Did they remember to program a 
sense of humor, as well, young lady"?   "We are directed 
to develop a sense of proportion, sir, which contributes the same effect".

The good man chortled appreciatively and decided the trip 
was worth his time.   If the investigation committee spent months 
digesting the thoughtful food served them at the Laboratory School, 
they left Helva with a morsel as well.   "Singing" as 
applicable to herself required research. She had, of course, been exposed 
to and enjoyed a music appreciation course which had included the 
better known classical works such as "Tristan und Isolde", "Candide", 
"Oklahoma", "Nozze de Figaro", the atomic age singers,
