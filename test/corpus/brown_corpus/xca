Laotian people- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority 
now engaged in the fighting- this last big effort to seal that 
country from the cold war had to be made. The world awaits Mr& Khrushchev's 
choice of alternatives. 

#A VOTE FOR EDUCATIONAL ~TV# 

The Senate's overwhelming (64-13) vote to support locally controlled 
educational ~TV efforts should be emulated in the lower 
house.   Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing 
~ETV and the House has let them die. But this year prospects 
may be better. The House communications subcommittee is expected to 
report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.

This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the 
District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private, 
state, or municipal ~ETV efforts. The funds would be used 
for equipment, not for land, buildings, or operation.   The relatively 
few communities that have educational stations have found them 
of considerable value. But, lacking money from commercial sponsors, the 
stations have had 
difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service. 
Other communities- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill- 
have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial 
cost of equipment. 

#A GOOD MAN DEPARTS GOODBY, MR& SAM#

Sam Rayburn was a good man, 
a good American, and, third, a good Democrat.   He was all 
of these rolled into one sturdy figure; Mr& Speaker, Mr& Sam, 
and Mr& Democrat, at one and the same time.   The House was 
his habitat and there he flourished, first as a young representative, 
then as a forceful committee chairman, and finally in the post for which 
he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House, and second 
most powerful man in Washington.   Mr& Rayburn was not an easy 
man to classify or to label. He was no flaming liberal, yet the New 
Deal, the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him. He was 
not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that persuasion will 
miss him as much as any.   Two of the vital qualities demanded 
of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence 
and that he keep his word. Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with 
him to the grave, for he was never loquacious, and his word, once 
given, was not subject to retraction. It might be added that as he kept 
his word so he expected that others keep theirs.   The demonstration 
of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical. His leadership 
was not for audiences. A growl, a nod, was usually enough. When it 
was not, one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented. 
He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon his chest, his 
hands gripping the side of a desk, and the political and legislative 
chatter would subside into silence.   He spoke briefly, sensibly, 
to the point and without oratorical flourishes He made good, plain 
American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted 
upon it.   These public efforts were rare because Mr& Rayburn 
normally did his counseling, persuading and educating long before 
an issue reached its test on the House floor. He expected Democrats 
to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them. With 
his long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing in a political 
leader.   {He was, of course, in the House for a very long 
time. There are only two men remaining in Congress who, with Rayburn, 
voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917. To 
almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the 
existence of Mr& Sam coincided with that of the House}. 
And it was the House he loved. To be presiding officer of it was the 
end of his desire and ambition. The Senate to him was not the "upper 
body" and he corrected those who said he served "under" the 
president. He served "with" him.   Sound the roll of those 
with whom he served and who preceded him in death. Woodrow Wilson, 
with whom he began his years in Washington, Warren G& Harding, 
Calvin Coolidge, ~FDR, with whom he managed a social revolution. 
And those still with us, Herbert C& Hoover, Harry S& Truman, 
Dwight D& Eisenhower and John F& Kennedy.   He was 
a fighter for those of his own party. Mr& Truman has only to recall 
the "hopeless" campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan 
he was and the first experience of Mr& Kennedy with Congress would 
have been sadder than it was had not Mr& Sam been there. As it 
was, his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.

With Republican presidents, he fought fair. He was 
his own man, not an automatic obstructionist. He kept his attacks 
on Republicanism for partisan campaigns, but that is part of the game 
he 
was born to play.   Under any name- Mr& Speaker, Mr& 
Democrat, Mr& Sam- he was a good man. #~UN OFF THE CONGO TRACK# 

Thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the 
cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent 
death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends.

In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported from that 
jungle. Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers dismembered the 
bodies and tossed the remains into the river. The excuse was offered 
for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries. 
In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central 
government might be condoned, had the victims been serving the cause 
of dissident Katanga.   Does this suggest that the Congo 
is fit for nationhood or that ~UN is making any progress whatever 
toward its goal of so making it? To the contrary, through the past 
six 
weeks violence has been piled upon violence. Mass rapes, troop mutinies, 
uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures, 
given no sanction by any political authority, have become almost 
daily occurrences. Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is 
not the work of Katanga. It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville 
government, which is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable 
of governing, and commanding only such limited credit abroad as ~UN 
support gives it.   The main question raised by the incident is 
how much longer will ~UN bury its head in the sand on the Congo 
problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in 
present terms? The probable answer is that it will do so just as long 
as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African 
nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting 
ruin on Central Africa.   Right now, they are pushing 
a resolution which would have ~UN use its forces to invade and subjugate 
Katanga. That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several 
points of view. The ~UN army is too weak, too demoralized for 
the task. Further, it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it 
is now garrisoned. Last, it makes no sense to deliver Katanga, the one 
reasonably solid territory, into the existing chaos.   The Congo 
should have been mandated, because it was not ready for independence. 
The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed 
over wisdom. It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because 
it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism. But if 
any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly, it 
is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and 
urge some new approach. Otherwise, ~UN will march blindly on to 
certain defeat. 

#FEATHERBED REVERSAL#

A recent editorial discussing 
a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific 
Co& and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized 
on the grounds that it was not based on complete information. 
The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that 
the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 
40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction 
in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year. Our comment 
was that this was "featherbedding" in its ultimate form and that 
sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such 
an agreement. The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad 
had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but 
that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.

Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad 
gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need. 
Also, normal personal attrition would make the job reduction provision 
more or less academic.   The situation with regard to the Southern 
Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable 
to other situations in other industries. The solution reached in 
the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally 
included in a series of union demands. 

#MEDITATIONS FROM A FALLOUT SHELTER#

Time was when the house of delegates 
of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense 
side. But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of 
the bar, and when the lads met in St& Louis, it was not to grumble 
about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations 
was scarcely less than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and 
there.   It was, the brief writers decided, "man's best hope 
for a peaceful and law abiding world". Peace, it's wonderful, and 
"world law", it's wonderful, too, and shouldn't we get an international 
covenant extending it into space, before the Russians put 
some claim jumper on the moon?   Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev 
was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build 
a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of ~TNT, to knock 
sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice 
of surrendering West Berlin to communism.   A nuclear pacifier 
of these dimensions- roughly some six and a half times bigger 
than anything the United States has triggered experimentally- would 
certainly produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev might 
use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St& 
Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.

While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed 
an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in 
the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.   "Fools", 
he bayed, "what do you think you are doing"?   The 
only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't 
playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations, but 
perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this 
feeble effort.   Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason 
was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American 
plane by a demented Algerian with a gun. The craft made the familiar 
unwelcome flight to Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro 
rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian 
foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer of old Ten O'Clock 
Shadow. The plane was sent back to the United States, for 
a change, but Castro kept the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable 
recruit to the revolution.   Less respect for the legal 
conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara, 
who edified the Inter-American Economic and Social council meeting 
in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined 
from the United States embassy at Caracas, Venezuela. The contents 
were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen, who were on hand 
to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.

Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing
