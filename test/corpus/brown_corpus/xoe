guidance is available to the man at sea on the use of such information. 
A concurrent effort is needed to make oceanographic data useful on 
the spot. ##

<Mine warfare> has in the past been directed against 
surface targets. By its nature it has always been of great psychological 
advantage and small efforts have required considerably greater 
counter-efforts. Mines are being increasingly oriented against submarine 
targets. They are still considered to be for use in restricted waters, 
however, and targets must come within a few yards of them. Mines 
need to be recognized as a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment, 
extended to deep water, and have their effective area per unit 
increased. Mines can be used to deny access to great areas; they 
are difficult to counter, cost little to maintain until required, and 
can be put into place quickly. A most attractive feature is that detection 
and attack are combined in a single package. Effective employment 
will reduce force requirements.   For example, effective mine 
barriers from Florida to Cuba and across the Yucatan Channel from 
Cuba to Mexico would remove all requirements for harbor defense, 
inshore patrol, convoy escort, shipping control, and mine defense for 
the entire Gulf of Mexico. More extended systems, covering all passage 
into the Caribbean, would free the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico 
from the previously listed requirements. Systems covering the Gulf 
of St& Lawrence and possibly the entire coasts of the United 
States are not impossible. Such mine defense systems could permit concentration 
of mobile forces in the open oceans with consequent increase 
in the probability of success. The advantages inherent in mine warfare 
justify as great an importance for this element as is accorded any 
of the other elements. ##

<Fixed installations> are increasingly 
advocated as the problem of area defense emerges. The proponents 
are scientific and technical men who exercise considerable influence 
on their military counterparts. Systems which detect submarines over 
wide areas are attractive, although they can be only "burglar alarms". 
Mobile forces are required to localize and attack detected targets, 
since the systems are not capable of pinpointing a target. Such systems 
are expensive and are oriented geographically. In an over-all 
~ASW concept, dependence on and effort expended for such systems 
should be limited to those with proven capabilities. No general installation 
should be made until a model installation has been proved and 
its maximum capability determined. In addition, proposals for fixed installations 
should be carefully weighed against a counterpart mobile 
system. For fixed installations will always lack the flexibility that 
should be inherent in naval systems. ##

<The submarine> has become 
increasingly attractive as an antisubmarine weapon system. It operates 
in its target's environment, and any advantage gained therefrom 
by the target is shared by the attacker. But the submarine is a weapon 
of ambush and therefore always in danger of being ambushed. 
Two metabolites (/1, and /2,) of ~p-aminobenzoic acid (~PABA) 
which act as cofactors for the hydroxylation of aniline by acid-fast 
bacteria are biosynthesized from ~PABA. The 7 carbons of ~PABA 
are incorporated directly into metabolite /2, (as shown with 
both ring-labeled and carboxy-labeled **f). Thirty-five of the 36 
carbon atoms arise from ~PABA. All 28 carbons of metabolite /1, 
(a product of mild acid hydrolysis of /2,) arise from ~PABA. 
Metabolite /1, isolated from the medium, however, showed a lower specific 
activity, which indicates endogenous synthesis of this metabolite.

Vigorous acid hydrolysis of metabolite /1, destroyed the 
biological activity of the compound and liberated two aryl amines. 
Fragment ~A has been obtained in crystalline form as a dioxalate salt 
and free base. Preliminary evidence tentatively indicates that the 
molecule (metabolite /1,) is cleaved at a secondary amide bond. (N& 
H& Sloane; chemical studies are being pursued with the cooperation 
of K&G& Untch.) _STUDIES ON ESTERASES_- Research 
on esterases in mammalian sera was continued. One of the most interesting 
findings was the extreme sensitivity of plasma arylesterases to 
rare earth ions. The inhibition of the enzyme by very low concentrations 
of lanthanum ion is probably the strongest known biological effect 
of rare earth salts. Various metal ions have been found to protect plasma 
arylesterase against inactivation by urea and guanidine. The effects 
can be related to the structure of this -~SH enzyme. The non-identity 
of serum and red blood cell arylesterase was also established. 
Furthermore, the hydrolysis of paraoxon was studied in mammalian 
sera, and it was found that it is hydrolyzed by albumin (or a factor attached 
to it) in addition to arylesterase. Selective inhibitors can 
distinguish the two activities. Investigations on the acceleration of 
human plasma cholinesterase were carried further. (E& G& Erdo^s, 
L& E& Boggs, C& D& Mackey) _BIOPHYSICAL STUDIES ON 
MODIFIED FIBROUS PROTEINS_- Electron-microscopical and physical-chemical 
methods were used to demonstrate the renaturation of heat-denatured 
collagen and ribonucleic acid. (R& V& Rice)   A method 
was devised for extracting and purifying soluble earthworm collagen 
(~EWC). It was observed that ~EWC macromolecules are the 
same diameter (15~A) but much longer (up to several microns) than 
vertebrate tropocollagen. This unusual collagen also was shown to undergo 
a reversible thermal phase transformation. (R& V& Rice, M& 
D& Maser) _STUDIES ON PEPTIDES AND PEPTIDASES_- This investigation 
involved several aspects. Substance ~Z, an active urinary 
peptide, was purified by extraction in organic solvents and repeated 
column chromatography; high-voltage electrophoresis and paper chromatography 
were used in preliminary structural studies; pharmacological 
effects <in vitro> on isolated surviving organs and <in vivo> 
on blood pressure were assayed; special equipment required for registering 
respiration and for recording the contraction of smooth muscles 
under various conditions was developed by the Instruments Section 
(Victor Jackman, W& C& Barnes, J& F& Reiss); and enzymes 
which terminate the action of peptides such as bradykinin and perhaps 
Substance ~Z were studied. Experiments are in progress to develop 
ultraviolet spectrophotometric techniques for assaying these enzymes 
and for studying their sensitivity to metal ions. (E& G& Erdo^s, 
C& D& Mackey, A& G& Renfrew, W& B& Severs, 
E& M& Sloane) _SEED PROTEINS_- In a physiochemical study 
of seed proteins, the globulins of the Brazil nut have been investigated. 
In addition to the known principal globulin, excelsin, three 
other ultracentrifugally distinct components have been observed. A 
water-soluble protein of quite low molecular weight (ca& 10,000) has 
also been found in this system and partly characterized. (E& F& 
Casassa, H& J& Notarius) 

#CONTINUUM MECHANICS AND VISCOELASTICITY# 

_THEORY OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUIDS_- On the basis of 
a differentiability assumption in function space, it is possible to prove 
that, for materials having the property that the stress is given by 
a functional of the history of the deformation gradients, the classical 
theory of infinitesimal viscoelasticity is valid when the deformation 
has been infinitesimal for all times in the past. By strengthening 
the differentiability assumption, it has been possible to derive second 
and higher order theories of viscoelasticity. In the second-order 
theory, one of the normal stress differences can be calculated from the 
first-order stress relaxation function. (B& D& Coleman with 
Walter Noll, Department of Mathematics, Carnegie Institute of Technology) 
_VISCOELASTIC MEASUREMENTS_- An extensive series of 
measurements was made on a high-density polyethylene in a torsion pendulum 
instrument using forced sinusoidal oscillation, free vibration, and 
creep measurements over the temperature range of **f to 80`C&. 
As many as seven decades of the time scale were thus covered isothermally. 
The simple time-temperature equivalence valid for many amorphous 
systems did not hold here. It was possible, however, to decompose 
the compliance into a sum of a frequency-independent component and two 
viscoelastic mechanisms, each compatible with the Boltzmann superposition 
principle and with a consistent set of time-temperature equivalence 
factors. (Hershel Markovitz, D&J& Plazek, Haruo Nakayasu) 

#GEOCHEMISTRY#

_TRACE ELEMENTS IN TEKTITES, METEORITES, AND RELATED 
MATERIALS_- The results of microanalysis of tektites (natural 
glasses of unknown origin) for gallium and germanium have shown that 
these glasses are probably produced from terrestrial (or less likely 
from lunar) matter by impact of a celestial body. The gallium/germanium 
ratio is higher than that for ordinary igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary 
matter as a result of selective volatilization of the components 
of the tektite. Gallium oxide is less volatile than silica (the 
main constituent of tektites) and germanium oxide is more volatile. Australites 
(tektites from Australia) give the appearance of a second 
melting. In conformity with this conclusion a higher trace gallium 
content was found in the portion (flange) that has undergone a second 
melting. The silicate fractions of stony meteorites show gallium/germanium 
ratios similar to those of tektites because they too have undergone 
melting at some point in their histories.   Libyan Desert silica-glass, 
another natural glass, is composed of nearly pure silica 
and has the same trace germanium content as sands in the area. The gallium 
content, however, has been enhanced five-fold. This glass is probably 
formed from Libyan Desert sands by comet or stony-meteorite 
impact.   Nickel-iron meteorites with sufficient kinetic energy 
to produce large terrestrial-explosion craters may nevertheless melt only 
small quantities of material. Most of the impact energy is spent 
in crushing and fragmentation. When rapid quenching follows melting, 
<impact glasses> may result. These always contain metallic inclusions. 
Impact glasses not containing elemental nickel-iron may have been 
produced by stony meteorites or comets. No meteorites have ever been 
recovered from paleoexplosion craters, and recent craters containing 
impact glass have all been produced by metallic meteorites with the exception 
of Aouelloul crater, Adrar, Western Sahara Desert. This 
crater contains impact glass with no metallic inclusions and no meteoritic 
material has been recovered. (A& J& Cohen, John Anania) 

#INORGANIC CHEMISTRY#

Preparation of a coordination compound is often 
accomplished by the simple method of reacting a metal salt with a 
ligand in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol. By applying this general 
principle, a great number of complex compounds of osmium, ruthenium, 
iridium, and rhenium, with triphenylphosphine, triphenylarsine, 
and triphenylstibine 
have been obtained in this laboratory during the past few 
years. (Lauri Vaska, E& M& Sloane, J& W& DiLuzio) 
In the absence of direct evidence to the contrary, decomposition of 
solvent alcohol <and> coordination of its fragments to the metal were 
not considered, following the above heretofore-accepted assumption in 
preparative coordination chemistry. Recent work with radiocarbon and 
deuterated alcohols as solvents, however, has given evidence that metal-hydrido 
and -carbonyl complexes may be readily formed by reaction 
with alcohol in some of these systems. Some of the previously reported 
compounds have thus been reformulated and a series of new hydrido and 
carbonyl compounds discovered, the more representative examples being 
**f, **f, **f, **f and **f (**f).   The coordination complexes 
formed by transition metals with primary and secondary phosphines and 
arsines are being investigated (R& G& Hayter). Particular interest 
is directed towards the condensation of these ligands with metal 
halides to form substituted phosphide or arside complexes. During the 
past year, these ligands have yielded some unusual five-coordinate complexes 
of nickel (/2,) and some interesting binuclear phosphorus-bridged 
complexes of palladium (/2,) (see figure), as well as new compounds 
of the well-known type **f. The structures, properties, and reactions
