is ordinarily on <leave>. When the same sequence is equivalent in 
meaning to <I have instructions which I am to leave>, dominant stress 
is ordinarily on <instructions>.   It is clear that patterns 
of stress sometimes 
show construction unambiguously in the spoken language where 
without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the written. 
Other examples follow. "I'll come by Tuesday. I 
can't be happy long without drinking water". In the first of these 
sentences if <by> is the complement of <come> and <Tuesday> is 
an adjunct of time equivalent to <on Tuesday>, there will be strong 
stress on <by> in the spoken language; but if a complement for 
<come> is implied and <by Tuesday> is a prepositional unit used as 
an adjunct, <by> will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most. In 
the second sentence if <drinking water> is a gerundial clause and 
<without drinking water> is roughly equivalent in meaning to <unless 
I drink water>, there will be stronger stress on <water> than on 
<drinking>; but if <drinking> is a gerundial noun modifying <water> 
and <without drinking water> is equivalent to <without water 
for drinking>, there will be stronger stress on <drinking> than on 
<water>. But the use of stress in comparison and contrast, for example, 
can undermine distinctions such as these. And patterns of stress 
are not always unambiguous by any means. In <the Steiners have 
busy 
lives without visiting relatives> only context can indicate whether <visiting 
relatives> is equivalent in meaning to <paying visits to relatives> 
or to <relatives who are visiting them>, and in <I looked 
up the number> and <I looked up the chimney> only the meanings 
of <number> and <chimney> make it clear that <up> is syntactically 
a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition followed 
by its object in the second. 

#SYLLABIFICATION.#- Syllables are 
linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but, as 
has been noted, are consonantal under certain circumstances, and which 
may or may not be combined with preceding and/or following consonants 
or combinations of consonants. Syllables are genuine units, but division 
of words and sentences into them presents great difficulties. Sometimes 
even the number of syllables is not clear. Doubt on this point 
is strongest before /l/ and /@/ or /r/. From the point of view 
of 
word formation <real> might be expected to have two syllables. Historically 
~<re> is the formative that is employed also in <republic>, 
and ~<al> is the common suffix. When ~<ity> is added, 
<real> clearly has two syllables. But there is every reason to regard 
<deal> as a monosyllable, and because of the fact that /l/ commonly 
has the quality of /@/ when it follows vowel sounds, <deal> seems 
to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with <real>.

It is obvious enough that linguists in general have been less 
successful in coping with tone systems than with consonants or vowels. 
No single explanation is adequate to account for this. Improvement, 
however, is urgent, and at least three things will be needed. 
The first is a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analyses. Even 
beginning students in linguistics are made familiar with an appreciable 
variety of consonant systems, both in their general outlines and in 
many specific details. An advanced student has read a considerable 
number of descriptions of consonantal systems, including some of the more 
unusual types. By contrast, even experienced linguists commonly know 
no more of the range of possibilities in tone systems than the over-simple 
distinction between register and contour languages. This limited 
familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work 
with tone. Tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory 
until a more representative selection of systems is familar to 
every practicing field linguist. Papers like these four, if widely read, 
will contribute importantly to improvement of our analytic work.

The second need is better field techniques. The great majority 
of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping 
types: those who are convinced that tone cannot be analysed, those who 
are personally scared of tone and tone languages generally, those who 
are convinced that tone is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in 
those languages where it occurs, those who have no idea how to proceed 
with tone analysis, those who take a simplistic view of the whole 
matter. The result has been neglect, fumbling efforts, or superficial 
treatment. As these maladies overlap, so must the cure. Analyses such 
as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone 
is impossible and that it is simple. They will give suggestions that 
can be worked up into field procedures. Good field techniques will not 
only equip linguists for better work, but also help them overcome negative 
attitudes. Actually, none of these papers says much directly about 
field techniques. But it is worth pondering that very little has 
been published on any phase of field techniques in linguistics. These 
things have been disseminated by other means, but always in the wake 
of extensive publication of analytic results.   The third need 
is for better theory. We should expect that general phonologic theory 
should be as adequate for tone as for consonants and vowels, but it has 
not been. This can only be for one of two reasons: either the two 
are quite different and will require totally different theory (and hence 
techniques), or our existing theories are insufficiently general. 
If, as I suspect, the problem is largely of the second sort, then development 
of a theory better able to handle tone will result automatically 
in better theory for all phonologic subsystems.   One issue 
that must be faced is the relative difficulty of analysis of different 
phonologic subsystems. Since tone systems typically comprise fewer 
units than either consonant or vowel systems, we might expect that they 
would be the easiest part of a phonologic analysis. Actual practice 
does not often work out this way. Tone systems are certainly more complex 
than the number of units would suggest, and often analytically 
more difficult than much larger consonantal systems.   Welmers has 
suggested one explanation. Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts 
speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use. 
This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion 
for the more knowledgeable. The problem is to disentangle the 
linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic 
features. 
Of course, something of the same sort occurs with other sectors of 
the phonology: consonantal articulations have both a linguistic and 
an individual component. But in general the individual variation is 
a small thing added onto basic linguistic features of greater magnitude. 
With tone, individual differences may be greater than the linguistic 
contrasts which are superimposed on them. Pitch differences from 
one speaker to another, or from one emotional state to another, may far 
exceed the small differences between tones. However, any such suggestion 
accounts for only some of the difficulties in hearing tone, or in 
developing a realistic attitude about tone, but not for the analytic 
difficulties that occur even when tone is meticulously recorded.

A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' 
paper. Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed. 
Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate 
the two and assign the observed phenomena individually to one or the 
other. Other pairs of phonologic subsystems also interact or overlap 
in this way; for example, duration sometimes figures in both the 
vowel system and the intonation. Some phonetic features, for example 
glottal catch or murmur, are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics 
and sometimes to accentual systems. But no other two phonologic 
systems are as difficult to disentangle as are tone and intonation in 
some languages. This explanation of tone difficulties, however, does 
not apply in all languages. In some (the Ewe type mentioned above) 
interaction of tone and intonation is restricted to the ends of intonation 
spans. In many of the syllables, intonation can be safely ignored, 
and much of the tonal analysis can be done without any study of intonation. 
Still, even in such languages tone analysis has not been as 
simple as one might expect.   A third explanation is suggested 
by Richardson's analysis of Sukuma tone. There we see a basically 
simple phonemic system enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic 
system. While the phonemes can be very easily stated, no one 
is likely to be satisfied with the statement until phonemic occurrences 
can be related in some way to morphemic units, i&e& until the morphophonemics 
is worked out, or at least far enough that it seems reasonable 
to expect success.   In the "typical tone language", 
tonal morphophonemics is of the same order of complexity as consonantal 
morphophonemics. The phonemic systems which must support these morphophonemic 
systems, however, are very different. The inventory of tones 
is much smaller, and commonly the contrasts range along one single 
dimension, pitch level. Consonantal systems are not merely larger, they 
are multidimensional. Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining 
certain points in the system. The possibilities in the consonantal 
system are very numerous, and only a small portion of them are actually 
used. Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule commonly show 
a good bit of phonetic similarity, possible because of the several dimensions 
of contrast in the system. Tonal morphophonemics, in a common 
case, can do nothing but either raise or lower the tone. The possibilities 
are few, and the total number of rules may be considerably greater. 
Often, therefore, there are a number of rules having the same 
effect, and commonly other sets of rules as well, having the opposite 
effect. Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning 
analyst than consonantal morphophonemics, even when the total number 
of rules is no greater.   The difficulty of analysis of any subsystem 
in the phonology is an inverse function of the size- smaller systems 
are more troublesome- for any given degree of morphophonemic 
complexity. This hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulties 
of tonal analysis, as well as the fact that vowel systems are 
often more puzzling than consonantal systems. The statement of the system 
is a different matter. Smaller systems can of course be stated 
much more succinctly. A phonemic system can be stated without reference 
to morphophonemics, but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics. 
And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation 
to the phonemic base, the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed 
without close attention to the morphophonemics- at least, the less 
satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through 
morphophonemic rules to grammatically meaningful structures.

The design of orthographies has received much less attention from 
linguists than the problem deserves. There has been a tendency on the 
part of many American linguists to assume that a phonemic transcription 
will automatically be the best possible orthography and that the only 
real problem will then be the social one of securing acceptance. This 
seems naive. Most others have been content to give only the most 
general attention to the broadest and most obvious features of the phonology 
when designing orthographies. Apparently the feeling is that 
anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible 
pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affairs. 
The result of this attitude has been the domination of many orthography 
conferences by such considerations as typographic 'esthetics', 
which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices 
carried over from European languages. Many of the suggested systems 
seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structures 
that they purport to represent. Linguists have not always been 
more enlightened than "practical people" and sometimes have insisted 
on incredibly trivial points while neglecting things of much greater 
significance. As a result, many people have been confirmed in their 
conviction that orthography design is not an activity to which experts 
can contribute anything but confusion.   A& E& Sharp, 
in Vowel-Length and Syllabicity in Kikuyu, examines one set of related 
orthographic questions and its phonologic background in detail. His 
objective is merely to determine "what distinctions of length and 
syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography" 
(59). To do so, he finds it necessary to examine the relevant 
parts of the phonology thoroughly and in detail. In the process, he
