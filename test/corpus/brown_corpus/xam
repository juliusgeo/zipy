
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both 
runners. When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple, he 
was cut down in a close play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey. 
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went 
like this:   Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde 
and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet 
over the scoreboard in right center. 

#CAREY SINGLES#

Carey singled 
on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field 
and threw wide to first. It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.

Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play. Breeding 
to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the 
wall in left center.   If the Orioles are to break their losing 
streak within the next two days, it will have to be at the expense 
of the American League champion New York Yankees, who come in here 
tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon. 

_MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_- The flavor of Baltimore's Florida 
Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles 
were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under 
the Army's military training program and is ready for belated 
spring training.   Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 
22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a .255 freshman average, completes the 
Birds' spring squad at 49 players.   The big, 22-year-old 
shortstop, the 1960 American league "rookie-of-the year", flew here 
late this afternoon from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated 
$15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas 
City- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row. 

#15 POUNDS 
LIGHTER#

The 6-foot 3 inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds, 
15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring. He hopes 
to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three 
weeks hence.   When he was inducted into the Army at Fort 
Knox, Ky&, Hansen's weight had dropped to 180- "too light 
for me to be at my best" he said.   "I feel good physically", 
Hansen added, "but I think I'll move better carrying a little 
less weight than I'm carrying now". 

#SEEKS "IMPROVED FIELDING"# 

The rangy, Albany (Cal&) native, a surprise slugging 
sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz, set 
"improved fielding" as his 1961 goal.

"I think I can do a better job with the glove, now that I 
know the hitters around the league a little better", he said.

Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to 
the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New 
York Yankees.   Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm, the Flock's 
veteran knuckleball specialists, are slated to oppose the American 
League champions in tomorrow's 8 P&M& contest. 

#DUREN, SHELDON 
ON HILL#

Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon, a rookie righthander 
who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn (N&Y&) 
farm club of the Class-~D New York-Pennsylvania League, 
are the probable rival pitchers.   Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas 
and Jerry Walker, 22, are scheduled to share the Oriole mound 
chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P&M& 
encounter.   Ralph Houk, successor to Casey Stengel at the 
Yankee helm, plans to bring the entire New York squad here from 
St& Petersburg, including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated 
for both weekend games. The famed Yankee Clipper, now retired, 
has been assisting as a batting coach. 

#SQUAD CUT NEAR#

Pitcher 
Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch 
under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course, also at 
Fort Knox, Ky&. The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last 
fall than did Hansen.   Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent 
now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and 
his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit. 
#@#

"Take a ride on this one", Brooks Robinson greeted 
Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed for the plate 
and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield 
wall tonight.   It was the first of two doubles by Robinson, 
who was in a mood to celebrate.   Just before game time, Robinson's 
pretty wife, Connie informed him that an addition to the family 
can be expected late next summer.   Unfortunately, Brooks' 
teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before 
the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers. #@# 

Hansen arrived just before nightfall, two hours late, in company 
with Lee MacPhail; J& A& W& Iglehart, chairman of the 
Oriole board of directors, and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn.

Their flight was delayed, Dunn said, when a boarding ramp 
inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane. #@#

Ex-Oriole 
Clint Courtney, now catching for the ~A's is all for the 
American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast.   "But 
they shouldda brought in Tokyo, too", added Old Scrapiron. 
"Then we'd really have someplace to go". 

_BOWIE, MD&, MARCH 17_- Gaining her second straight victory, 
Norman B&, Small, Jr&'s Garden Fresh, a 3-year-old filly, 
downed promising colts in the $4,500 St& Patrick's Day Purse, 
featured seventh race here today, and paid $7.20 straight.   Toying 
with her field in the early stages, Garden Fresh was asked for 
top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length 
and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs. 

#8,280 ATTEND RACES# 

Richard M& Forbes's Paget, which had what seemed to be a 
substantial lead in the early stages, tired rapidly nearing the wire and 
was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T& 
Hallowell's 
Milties Miss.   A bright sun and brisk wind had the 
track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St& 
Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program.

Prior to the featured race, the stewards announced that apprentice 
James P& Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and 
crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday. 

#CULMONE GETS 
FIRST WIN#

Garden Fresh, the result of a mating of Better Self 
and Rosy Fingered, seems to improve with each start and appeared to 
win the St& Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve. 
She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 
claiming event. 

_CLEVELAND, MARCH 17 (~AP)_- George Kerr, the swift-striding 
Jamaican, set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus 
track meet tonight, beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot 
duel in 1.10.1.   Kerr, who set the world record earlier this month 
in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3, wiped out Mills's early 
pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards. Both 
were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield.

Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of 
the race. Then Kerr, a graduate student from Illinois, moved past 
him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn. 
Mills was timed in 1.10.4.   The crowd at the twenty-first 
annual K& of C& Games, final indoor meet of the season, got a 
thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender, bespectacled woman broke 
the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run.   Mrs& Grace 
Butcher, of nearby Chardon, a 27-year-old housewife who has two 
children, finished in 2.21.6. She snapped five tenths of a second off 
the mark set by Helen Shipley, of Wellsley College, in the National 
A&A&U& meet in Columbus, Ohio. 

_SAN FRANCISCO, MARCH 17 (~AP)_- Bobby Waters of Sylvania, 
Ga&, relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National 
Football League, will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin 
Hospital here.   Waters injured his left knee in the last 
game of the 1960 season. While working out in Sylvania a swelling 
developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician._ST& 
PETERSBURG, FLA&, MARCH 17 (~AP)_- Two errors by New 
York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated 
four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox 
today. 

_AUSTIN, TEXAS_- A Texas halfback who doesn't even know the 
team's plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference 
scoring after three games.   Time stands still every time Moritz, 
a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field. Although 
he never gets to play while the clock is running, he gets a big 
kick- several every Saturday, in fact- out of football. 
Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of 
the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily 
favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.   That's 
because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries. He ran 
his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before 
one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington 
State.   Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right 
halfback, the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team. But 
ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the 
quick response, "place-kicker".   A 208-pound, 6-foot 1-inch 
senior from Stamford, Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking. Last 
year, when he worked out at halfback all season, he didn't get 
into a single game.   "This year, coach Royal told me if I'd 
work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me", said Moritz. 
"So I started practicing on it in spring training.   Moritz 
was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle 
in the thigh of his right (kicking) leg and, as a result, several of 
his successful conversions have gone barely far enough.   Moritz 
said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a result, he hopes to start 
practicing field goals this week. He kicked several while playing at 
Stamford High School, including one that beat Anson, 3-0, in a 1953 
district game.   "I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries
