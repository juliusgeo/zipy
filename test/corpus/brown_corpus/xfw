asking for it, he thought.   For five days now, they had been 
in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold. Richardson wondered 
when it would be unloaded. He hoped they would put it somewhere way, 
way down in the earth. The burden of his secret was pressing down 
on him, as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men. 
Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the <John 
Harvey> in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing 
more dangerous than high explosive bombs. They seemed happy at the 
delay in unloading, glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty 
port such as Bari. Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already. 
Deck Cadet James L& Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had 
been the first to leave. Richardson had returned their departing grins 
with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in 
trade.   The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his men, 
had remained aboard. Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly. 
Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor- 
Porto Vecchio. The night was so clear that Richardson had no 
difficulty making out the silhouette. Then the thought of a cloudless 
sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward. His eyes boggled.

It was a clear night and it was raining!   Capt& Michael 
A& Musmanno, Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula, had 
also seen and felt the "rain". But he had mistaken it for bugs.

Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant 
name <Unsinkable> had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed 
olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population. Musmanno 
was on deck. At exactly 7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush 
his face. He snatched at it savagely. He turned the beam of his flashlight 
on it. He laughed. It was the silver foil from the chocolate 
bar he had been eating. He frowned. But how could-? Another, 
longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth. It was two feet long. It was 
not candy wrapping.   It was "window"- the tinsel paper 
dropped by bombers to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds 
of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.   "Fermate"! 
Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen. "Stop! Stop 
the engines"!   <Unsinkable> slowed and stopped, hundreds 
of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the air 
raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the anti-aircraft guns coughed 
and chattered- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came 
whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor 
at Bari.   They had come from airports in the Balkans, these 
hundred-odd Junkers 88's. They had winged over the Adriatic, they 
had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her, 
attacking with deadly skill. They had ruined the radar warning system 
with their window, they had made themselves invisible above their flares. 
And they also had the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns, 
and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on. After the first two 
were blacked out, the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian 
crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring 
homing beacon until British ~MP's shot it out.   In that 
interval, the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor.   Merchant 
ships illuminated in the light of the flares, made to seem like 
stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud, were impossible to miss. 
The little <Unsinkable> sank almost immediately. Captain Musmanno 
roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for 
a raft. They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few 
minutes before their schooner went under.   <John Bascom> 
went down early, too. Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly, 
but they had no targets. Most of the Junkers were above the 
blinding light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore gun had 
been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs. Vesole rushed 
from gun to gun, attempting to direct fire. He was wounded, but fought 
on. Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors. 
Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20~mm gun, pumping out 400 rounds 
before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One, Three and 
Five. Now the <Bascom> was mortally wounded. Luckily, she was 
not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.

The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of pain could 
be heard from the wounded below decks.

THERE IS a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at 
you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed in amazement. You explain, 
"I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this 
very same event before. I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed 
this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in 
the past"!   This experience will have happened to many of 
you.   Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the "**h startling experience 
which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular 
passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same 
order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have 
been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard 
precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when".

Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling 
as the <deja vue (already seen)> illusion, just as they dismiss 
dream previsions as coincidences. In this manner they side-step the seemingly 
hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which 
all of us grope continually.   When a man recognizes a certain 
experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance 
of <deja vue>, 
except for the fact that he knows just why the experience 
seems familiar. Occasionally there are examples of prevision 
which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.

One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an event 
which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream, detailed 
the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion 
was completely mystified.   Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the "jargon" 
of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered 
"**h how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life 
film"? The famous author tells us of the strange incident in <Something 
About Myself>.   One day when he attended a war memorial 
ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout 
man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the 
rough slab flooring and someone, clasping him by the arm, whispered, 
"I want a word with you, please". At that moment Kipling was 
overwhelmed with awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical 
details of scene, action and word had occurred to him in a dream six 
weeks earlier.   Freud probably contributed more than anyone else 
to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents 
in our wakeful thoughts. However, readers who accept Freud's 
findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of 
dreams, should ponder over the following words in his <Interpretation 
Of Dreams,> Chapter /1,: "**h as a matter of fact no such 
complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case, 
and what is more, every one attempting such solution has found that 
in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream 
the source of which he has been unable to explain **h nor is the discussion 
closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams".

Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance, 
prevision and retrovision. <The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces 
all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical 
dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual continuities>.

I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream in which I 
lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town. I am 
sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence, 
so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news pictures 
I have seen. And when psychology explains glibly, "but the subconscious 
mind is able to produce it" it refers to a mental region so vaguely 
identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably 
as part of the individual mind.   Skeptics may deny the 
more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally 
observed, but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance 
of routine evidence.   The question becomes, "What is 
a dream"?   Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?

Every dream, and this is true of a mental image of any type 
even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful 
thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available. 
In most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals or objects. 
But these are dreamed in original action, in some particular continuity 
which we don't remember having seen in real life. For instance, 
the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with 
photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car; whereas, it is 
a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car. There is nothing to 
suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original, 
realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.

The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of 
a mental image can find no logical support. <A "mental image" subconsciously 
impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful 
thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at 
all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory 
stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension>.   Dreams 
that display events of the future with photographic detail call 
for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including 
that weird feeling of <deja vue>, inevitably fantastic though 
that theory must seem.   As in the theory of perception, established 
in psycho-physiology, the eye is recognized as an integral part 
of the brain. But then this theory confesses that it is completely at 
a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain. The 
opening paragraph of the chapter titled <The Theory Of Representative 
Perception,> in the book <Philosophies Of Science> by 
Albert G& Ramsperger says, "**h passed on to the brain, and there, 
by some unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception".

But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image 
within the brain? As retinal images are conceded to be an integral 
function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between 
the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation 
from the various brain centers- rather than to theorize on the 
transmission 
of an image which is already in required location. Hereby, 
the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen, 
not the retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive 
cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory 
centers, motor tensions, associated word symbols, and consciousness.

Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists 
of minute waves of energy. We know that the number of radio and 
television impulses, sound waves, ultra-violet rays, etc&, that may 
occupy 
the very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency, is infinite. 
So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal, 
apparently momentary states of matter, successive one after 
another in consciousness, but permanent each on its own basic phase of 
the progressive frequencies. This theory makes it possible for any 
event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to 
consciousness.   Space in any form is completely measured by the 
three dimensions. If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and 
not purely metaphysical, through what medium does it extend? It is 
not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science 
fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past, 
or the ever-existent past-fantasy future. Three seconds flat is the 
usual time, and the space is crossed by moderate mileage, while the 
overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static
