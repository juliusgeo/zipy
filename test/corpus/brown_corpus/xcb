American diplomatic papers and planes, but the Kennedy administration 
can always file a demurrer to the effect that, but for its own 
incompetence in protecting American interests, these things would 
not happen. The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion 
mounted by the administration last April, which, we trust, is not 
symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious 
Khrushchev.   Pass the iron rations, please, and light another 
candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read 
a bit of world law just to pass the time away. 

#THE CUSTOMER LOSES 
AGAIN#

The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission 
has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates 
on grain, as they had planned to do this month.   The request for 
lower rates originated with the Southern railway, which has spent 
a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which 
it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional, 
smaller car. By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent, it and 
its 
associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have 
lost to truckers and barge lines.   The board's action shows 
what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws. 

#A SHOCK WAVE FROM AFRICA#

WORD OF Dag Hammarskjold's death 
in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe. 
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace, and 
his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously. It was 
on the eve of a momentous U&N& session to come to grips with cold 
war issues. His firm hand will be desperately missed.   Mr& 
Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace. He had sought 
talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga 
province where recent fighting had been bloody. He earnestly 
urged a cease-fire.   The story of the fatal crash is not fully 
known. The U&N&-chartered plane which was flying from the conference 
city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun 
bullets last weekend and was newly repaired. Whether this, or 
overt action, was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.

The death of Mr& Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' 
most controversial leader. He was controversial because he was uncompromising 
for peace and freedom with justice. He courageously defended 
the rights of small nations, and he stood his ground against the 
savage attacks of the Communist bloc.   The Congo, in whose cause 
he died, was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs. His policies 
had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war 
and workable solutions were beginning to take shape. When the recent 
Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr& Hammarskjold, despite 
the danger, flew to exert a calming influence. He gave his life 
for his beliefs.   The U&N& session scheduled for today 
will meet under the cloud of his passing. It is a crucial session with 
the world on the edge of momentous developments.   If the manner 
of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication 
the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason 
and justice. That is the hope of mankind. 

#MONUMENT TO TOGETHERNESS# 

REACHING AGREEMENT on projects of value to the whole community 
has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks. Too 
many have bogged down in bickering. Even when public bodies arrived at 
a consensus, at least one dissenting vote has been usual.   So 
we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity. All nine members of 
the Inter-American Center Authority voted for Goodbody + Company's 
proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.

The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms 
of its contract. If the indenture is accepted, the authority will 
proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue. Then Goodbody 
will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious 
Graves Tract to house the center.   The next step awaits 
approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade 
County Port Authority. They allotted $500,000 three years ago to 
support Interama until its own financing could be arranged. Less than 
half the sum has been spent, since the Interama board pinched pennies 
during that period of painstaking negotiations. The balance is being 
budgeted for the coming year.   Unanimity on Interama is not 
surprising. It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly 
everyone is agreed. The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim 
of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project. 
County officials have cooperated consistently. So have the people's 
elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.   Interama, 
as it rises, will be a living monument to Greater Miami's 
ability 
to get together on worthwhile enterprises. 

#A SHORT REPORT AND 
A GOOD ONE#

PROGRESS, or lack of it, toward civil rights in 
the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued 
last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

Much happened in this field during the past 12 months. Each state 
advisory committee documented its own activity. Some accounts are quite 
lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all, requiring only four 
paragraphs.   "The established pattern of relative calm in the 
field of race relations has continued in all areas", reported this 
group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South 
Floridians, William D& Singer and John B& Turner of Miami.

"No complaints or charges have been filed during the past 
year, either verbally or written, from any individual or group.

"The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed 
in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in 
its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from 
time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights".   Problems 
have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most 
cases with understanding and restraint. The progress reported by the 
advisory committee is real. While some think we move too fast and others 
too slowly, Florida's record is a good one and stands out among 
the 50. 

#WEST GERMANY REMAINS WESTERN#

WEST GERMANY will 
face the crucial tests that lie ahead, on Berlin and unification, with 
a coalition government. This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's 
national election.   Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic 
Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough 
to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957. In 
order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival 
parties which gained strength. Inevitably this means some compromise.

The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired. Both 
Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22 seats in the 
new parliament, and the Free Democrats, who picked up 23, will insist 
on that before they enter the government.   Moon-faced Ludwig 
Erhart, the economic expert, probably will ascend to the leadership 
long denied him.   If he becomes chancellor, Dr& Erhart would 
make few changes. The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing 
industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise. He is dedicated 
to building the nation's strength and, as are all West Germans, 
to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany.

What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the 
voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result. 
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per cent of the vote, 
approaches the party of Willy Brandt, which won 36 per cent, the result 
would be a stiffening of the old resolve. West Berlin's Mayor 
Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his 
city and won votes by it.   The Free Democrats (12 per cent 
of the vote) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with 
the Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist bloc.

The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly 
toward more firmness or more flexibility. It could go either 
way, since the gains for both points of view were about the same.

Regardless of the decision two facts are clear. West Germany, with 
its industrial and military might, reaffirmed its democracy and remains 
firm with the free nations. And the career of Konrad Adenauer, 
who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which 
Bismarck 
began, draws near the end. 

#BETTER ASK BEFORE JOINING#

AMERICANS 
are a nation of joiners, a quality which our friends find endearing 
and sometimes amusing. But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't 
want to make a spectacle of himself.   For instance, so-called 
"conservative" organizations, some of them secret, are sprouting 
in the garden of joining where "liberal" organizations once took 
root.   One specific example is a secret "fraternity" which 
will "coordinate anti-Communist efforts". The principle is commendable 
but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get 
gulled.   According to The Chicago Tribune News Service, 
State Atty& Gen& Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series 
of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization 
seeking his money and his name: _1._ Does it assail schools 
and churches with blanket accusations? _2._ Does it attack other 
traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges? 

_3._ Does it put the label of un-American or subversive on 
everyone with whom it disagrees politically? _4._ Does it attempt 
to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars, 
communism, depression, and other troubles of the world? _5._ Does 
it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone 
calls and letter writing campaigns? _6._ Do its spokesmen 
seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the 
principles they purport to advocate?   In some instances a seventh 
question can be added: _7._ Does the organization show an 
affinity for a foreign government, political party or personality in opposition 
or preference to the American system?   If the would-be 
joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists 
who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic 
apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time. FALLING somewhere 
in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas- difficult 
to see but undeniably there, nevertheless- is the tropical green 
"city" of Islandia, a string of offshore islands that has almost 
no residents, limited access and an unlimited future. The latter is 
what concerns us all. Whatever land you can see here, from the North 
tip end of Elliott Key looking southward, belongs to someone- people 
who have title to the land. And what you can't see, the land 
underneath the water, belongs to someone, too. The public. The only
