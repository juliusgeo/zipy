Do not wonder that 
I said to thee, "You must be born again". St& John 3:7. 

_THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE GOD IS HOLY._ But as the One 
who called you is holy, be you also holy in all your behavior; for 
it is written, You shall be holy, because I am holy. /1, St& Peter 
1:15, 16.   Holiness without which no man will see God. 
Hebrews 12:14. _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE ALL HAVE SINNED._ 
As it is written, There is not one just man; there is none 
who understands; there is none who seeks after God. All have gone 
astray together; **h All have sinned and have need of the glory of 
God. Romans 3:10-12, 23. _THE NEW BIRTH IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE 
NATURAL MAN IS SPIRITUALLY DEAD AND BLIND._ Therefore as through 
one man sin entered into the world and through sin death, and thus death 
has passed unto all men because all have sinned. Romans 5:12.

You also, when you were dead by reason of your offenses and sins. 
Ephesians 2:1.   And if our gospel also is veiled, it is veiled 
only to those who are perishing. In their case, the god of this 
world [Satan] has blinded their unbelieving minds, that they should 
not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image 
of God. /2, Corinthians 4:3, 4.   For his workmanship 
we are, created in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:10. _THE NEW BIRTH 
IS EFFECTED THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD_ For you have been reborn, 
not from corruptible seed but from incorruptible, through the word of 
God. /1, St& Peter 1:23.   Of his own will he has begotten 
us by the word of truth. St& James 1:18.   Amen, amen, 
I say to thee, unless a man be born again of water [symbol of the 
Word of God, see Ephesians 5:26] and the Spirit, he cannot enter 
into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; 
and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. St& John 3:5, 
6. 

#EVIDENCES OF THE NEW BIRTH#


_IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE HAVE 
FAITH IN CHRIST AS THE ONLY SAVIOUR._ Everyone who believes that 
Jesus is the Christ is born of God. /1, St& John 5:1.

As many as received him **h were born **h of God. St& John 1:12, 
13. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE DO NOT PRACTICE SIN AS A HABIT._ 
Whoever is born of God does not commit sin [That is, he does not 
practice sin. Cf& /1, St& John 2:1]. /1, St& John 3:9.

We know that no one who is born of God commits sin. /1, 
St& John 5:18. [The new nature, received at the time of regeneration, 
is divine and holy, and as the believer lives under the power 
of this new nature he does not practice sin.] _IF WE ARE BORN OF 
GOD WE PRACTICE RIGHTEOUSNESS._ If you know that he [God] is just 
[righteous], know that everyone also who does what is just [righteous] 
has been born of him. /1, St& John 2:29. _IF WE ARE 
BORN OF GOD WE LOVE GOD._ Everyone who loves is born of God, and 
knows God. /1, St& John 4:7. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE LOVE 
THE BRETHREN._ We know that we have passed from death to life, because 
we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death. /1, 
St& John 3:14. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE OVERCOME THE WORLD._ 
All that is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory 
that overcomes the world, our faith. /1, St& John 5:4. 

_IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE GROW IN [NOT INTO, BUT IN] GRACE._ But 
grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
/2, St& Peter 3:18. _IF WE ARE BORN OF GOD WE PERSEVERE UNTO 
THE END._ I am convinced of this, that he who has begun a good work 
in you will bring it to perfection until the day of Christ Jesus. 
Philippians 1:6.   Now to him who is able to preserve you without 
sin and to set you before the presence of his glory, without blemish, 
in gladness, to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ 
our Lord, belong glory and majesty, dominion and authority, before 
all time, and now, and forever. St& Jude 24. _THE NEW BIRTH IS 
NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM REQUIRES A SPIRITUAL NATURE._ 
Jesus answered and said to him [Nicodemus] "Amen, amen, I say 
to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God". 
**h "Amen, amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again 
of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That 
which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of 
the Spirit is spirit. Do not wonder that I said to thee, 'You must 
be born again'". St& John 3:3, 5-7. 

#THE NATURE OF THE 
NEW BIRTH#


_THE NEW BIRTH IS A NEW CREATION._ For in Christ Jesus 
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision but a new creation is of 
any account. Galatians 6:15.   If then any man is in Christ, 
he is a new creature [literally, "He is a new creation"], the 
former things have passed away; behold, they are made new! /2, Corinthians 
5:17.   For by grace you have been saved through faith; 
and that not from yourselves, for it is the gift of God; not 
as the outcome of works, lest anyone may boast. For his workmanship 
we are, created in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 2:8-10. _THE NEW BIRTH 
IS THE IMPLANTATION OF A NEW LIFE._ I came that they may have life. 
St& John 10:10.   He who has the Son has the life. He 
who has not the Son has not the life. /1, St& John 5:12.

He who believes in the Son [Jesus Christ, the Son of God], 
has everlasting life. St& John 3:36. _THE NEW BIRTH IS THE 
IMPARTATION OF THE DIVINE NATURE._ Through which he has granted us 
the very great and precious promises, so that through them you may become 
partaker of the divine nature. /2, St& Peter 1:4. _THE NEW 
BIRTH IS CHRIST LIVING IN YOU BY FAITH._ Christ in you, your hope 
of glory. Colossians 1:27.   It is now no longer I that live, 
but Christ lives in me. And the life that I now live in the flesh, 
I live in the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself 
up for me. Galatians 2:20.   To have Christ dwelling through 
faith in your hearts. Ephesians 3:17. _THE NEW BIRTH IS MIRACULOUS 
AND MYSTERIOUS._ The wind blows where it will, and thou hearest 
its sound but dost not know where it comes from or where it goes. 
So is everyone who is born of the Spirit. St& John 3:8. _THE 
NEW BIRTH IS IMMEDIATE AND INSTANTANEOUS._ Amen, amen, I say to 
you, he who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has life everlasting, 
and does not come to judgment, but has passed from death to 
life. St& John 5:24. 

#THE MEANS OF THE NEW BIRTH#


_THE NEW 
BIRTH IS A WORK OF GOD._ But to as many as received him he gave the 
power of becoming sons of God; to those who believe in his name: 
Who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the 
will of man, but of God. St& John 1:12, 13. 

#A FINAL WORD# 

You may be very religious, a good church member, an upright, honest 
and sincere person; you may be baptized, confirmed, reverent and worshipful; 
you may attend mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously 
keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church; you may have 
the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost 
and headed for hell and eternal punishment. You cannot be saved; 
you cannot go to heaven unless you are born again. Our blessed Lord 
Jesus Christ, the sinless Son of God, who could not lie, said, 
"Amen, 
amen, I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see 
the kingdom of God" (St& John 3:3). "You must be born again" 
(St& John 3:7).   Being convinced that salvation is 
alone by accepting Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy 
Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort to be saved 
by any form of good works, and just now receive Jesus as my personal 
Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him.

YOU MAY DO AS YOU 
PLEASE with God now. It is permitted. God placed Himself in men's 
hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God 
and perfect Man in one Being. He was then in man's hands. They 
cursed Him. It was permitted. Men spit on Him. God allowed it. 
They called Him a devil. God withheld His wrath. Finally men arrested 
Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged Him, nailed Him on a cross 
and hung Him between earth and heaven; and God allowed it.

You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present. You can 
ignore Him. You can ignore His Book, the Bible, and His church. 
You 
can laugh at His blood-bought salvation, curse His followers, and 
laugh at hell. It is permitted. The eternal Christ may knock at your 
soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven. 
You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him a devil, curse Him. It 
is permitted. You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses 
if you so choose. He is in your hands- <now>.   On the 
other hand, you may seek His favor, humble yourself before Him and beg 
His mercy, implore His forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon 
your whole life to Him. He has said, "Behold, I stand at the door, 
and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will 
come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 
3:20). The choice is up to you. The latch is on your side of the 
door. The choice is yours: the revellings and banquetings of this 
world or quiet communion with God; the ever burning lusts of the flesh 
or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline. The choice is 
yours: God is in your hands, <now>.   God has already set 
the day when <you will be in His hands>. What He does with you <then> 
depends on what you do with Him <now>. <Then> it will be 
a "fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God" if you 
have abused Him in your hands. 
I am a magazine; my name is Guideposts; this issue that you are 
reading marks my 15th anniversary.   When I came into being, 15 
years ago, I had one primary purpose: to help men and women everywhere 
to know God better, and through knowing Him better to become happier 
and more effective people. That purpose has never changed.

When you read me, you are holding in your hands the product of many 
minds and hearts. Some of the people who speak through my pages are 
famous; others unknown. Some work with their hands. Some have walked 
through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope. Some 
are so filled with gratitude, for the gift of life and the love of God, 
that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands 
whom they have never known, and will never see.   Fifteen 
years ago, there were no Guideposts at all. This month a million 
Guideposts will circulate all over the world. Experts in the publishing 
field consider this astounding. They do not understand how a small 
magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved 
such a following.   To me, the explanation is very simple. I 
am not doing anything, of myself. I am merely a channel for **h <something>.

What is this something? I cannot define it fully. 
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness, even 
when they turn away from it. It is the power that holds the stars in 
their orbits, but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass. It is the 
whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is. It
