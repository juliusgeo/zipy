She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was 
once considered too helpless. She liked this taste of authority and 
independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.

"Very few wives", says Dr& Calderone, "who balance the checkbook, 
fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with 
the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned. 
A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the 
sexual relationship as well".   And an additional factor was 
helping to make women more sexually self-assertive- the comparatively 
recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response. 
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the 
importance of the female climax. They began to describe in detail the 
woman's capacity for response.   In fact, the noted psychologist 
and sex researcher, Dr& Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that 
women are "sexually superior" to men. According to Dr& Ellis, 
the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual 
arousal than her partner. Not surprisingly, Dr& Ellis says, 
some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.

Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr& Maurice Linden, many 
wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them. An aggressive 
woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under. "When the husband 
becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", Dr& 
Linden says, "the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. Often she 
fails to gain sexual satisfaction".   One such wife, Dr& 
Linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through 
a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger 
man. But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until 
that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity. Then the 
wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.   In some cases, however, 
domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered 
by a passing but urgent emotional need. Thus a man who is butting 
a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed- 
the one place he can still be champion. If his on-the-job problems work 
out, he may return to his old pattern. Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness 
will sweep over a man- or his wife- because he or she feels 
age creeping up.   On the other hand, a husband who always has 
been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive- asking, 
psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable. 
Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered 
or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.   In any case, 
Dr& Calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair, 
and can't always be measured by a general yardstick. "As long 
as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little 
difference if one or the other dominates", Dr& Calderone declares. 
"The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment".

Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination 
by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period, 
it is likely to shake the marriage. And just as domination today often 
begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.

"To get a marriage back where it belongs", comments Dr& 
Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, "the husband must take 
some very basic steps. He must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more 
selfish. He must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding 
and less 'understanding'".   Too many husbands, Dr& 
Schillinger continues, worry about "how well they're doing", 
and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual 
play.

SHE GAVE HERSELF a title **h Lady Diana Harrington.

The New York D&A& gave her another **h the Golden Girl 
of cafe society.   Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant, 
title **h prostitute.   And Houston police have the final 
say in the matter since she died there on September 20, 1960, "Diane 
Harris Graham, 30, D&O&A& circumstances- unusual".

Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men, 
there was money, and with the two came luxury and liquor. She was still 
in the play for pay business when she died, a top trollop who had 
given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.

She never hid the fact that she liked to play. Her neighbors 
in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that 
the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as 
"the Golden 
Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial".   It was the trial of 
oleomargarine heir Minot (Mickey) Jelke for compulsory prostitution 
in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl. 
(Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding 
a ring of high-priced call girls.)   Diane was needed as a material 
witness in the case and New York police searched three continents 
before they found her in their own back yard- in a swank hotel, 
of course. She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington, 
a name that made some of the gossip columns.   It was when 
she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation 
she liked best.   Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant 
District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning 
judge:   "This girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.

"In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County. In 
the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign 
tycoon who took her to France, where she later met a very wealthy man 
and toured all Europe with him.   "At Deauville she met an 
Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey. He was the official procurer for 
King Farouk, now in exile. She was in Egypt during the revolution 
and had passport difficulty. She lied in order to get it.   "We 
have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally 
back into this country **h She has been acting as a prostitute.

"Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts 
to Jelke".   Diane sobbingly denied this to the court. 
"That's a lie. I never gave that boy a cent. I am not a prostitute, 
and I had only one very wealthy boy friend", she said. 
During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up part of that statement.

"Diane is the type of girl", Jelke said, "who wouldn't 
get loving- even on her wedding night- unless you piled up 
all your money in the middle of the floor".   But she seemed to 
have underestimated the number of her "boy friends".   She 
came to New York from Detroit as a teenager, but with a "sponsor" 
instead of a chaperone. As she told it, "He's a rich boy friend, 
an old guy about 60". She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed, 
but not naive. She had talked her "boy friend" into sending her 
to New York to take a screen test.

The screen test was never made- but Diane was. She quickly 
moved into cafe society, possibly easing her conscience by talking 
constantly of her desire to be in show business.   She seemed 
so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail 
circuit set up a practical joke.   An ex-fighter was introduced 
to her in a bar as "Mr& Warfield, the famous producer". The 
phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.

"I'd love to audition for you", she gushed.   The 
audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment. She 
thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show 
the eminent producer how well she could dance.   After a few minutes 
he said, "I can't use you if you dance like that. I'd like 
to see you dance nude".   She hastily complied. Diane loved 
to dance in the nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.

She developed another quaint habit. Even among the fast set 
in which she was moving, her method for keeping an escort from departing 
too early was unique.   When the date would try to bid her 
good-night at the door, she would tell him, "If you go home now, I'll 
scream". More often than not he would bow to the inevitable.

One who needed no such threats was a French financier. One of 
the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel. She wanted 
to go around the world, but she settled for a French holiday.

In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told 
of spending several months with her. "Then she went to Deauville 
where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers".

The Greek evidently fell for her, "Monsieur ~X" recounted, 
and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he 
gave her 100,000 francs (about $300) and led her to the roulette tables.

She could do no wrong at the tables that time. And in short 
order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way. Smarter 
than most gamblers, she slipped away from the casino, packed her bag 
and took the night train to Paris. No one ever learned what happened 
to the Greek.   The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel, 
the George /5,, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so she high-tailed 
it to Rome.   She teamed up with another beauty, whose 
name has been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling that 
would have made Nero envious.   To climax her Roman revels, she 
was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked 
through its marble halls screaming for help.   It was a rugged 
finish for what must have been a very interesting night.   Discreet 
Italian police described it in a manner typically continental.

"There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom: 
Miss Harrington (this was Diane's choice for a Roman name), 
another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and 
one of your well-known American actors.   "The actor had had 
much to drink and apparently became very violent. The hotel staff, 
as well as residents of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies 
were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.

"They were wearing nothing but their scratches. They were 
asked to leave the hotel. No charges were filed".   The girls, 
after dressing, were indignant.   "You can't do this to 
us", Diane screamed. "We are Americans".   In the morning 
she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally 
luxurious Hotel Ambassador.   With the Ambassador as headquarters, 
she continued to promote good will abroad. Of course, her benevolence 
was limited to those who could afford it, but then there is a 
limit to what one person can do.   By this time Diane was a beguiling 
lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world. She thought 
royal status might come her way when, while she was still in Rome, 
she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt.

A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this 
way:   "It was a strange relationship. Pulley Bey spoke no 
English. Diane spoke no Italian or French. She had a hard time 
making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.   "Pulley 
Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him", the friend 
continued. It seemed as though she were always auditioning. 
No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors, the plump 
Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she 
waited for nine months, vainly hoping to see Farouk.   Pulley 
had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but she grew impatient waiting 
for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the
