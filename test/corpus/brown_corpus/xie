with aloofness almost anywhere: the Thank-Heaven-We're-not-Involved 
viewpoint, It Doesn't Affect Us! Southern Liberals 
(there are a good many)- especially if they're rich- often exhibit 
blithe insouciance. The trouble here is that it's almost too easy 
to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything. 
You've already sent your daughter to Miss ~X's select academy 
for girls and your son to Mr& ~Y's select academy for boys, and 
you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity. If there's 
no suitable academy in your own neighborhood, there's always New 
England. New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces, 
South as well as West. They may even enroll a colored student 
or two for show, though he usually turns out to be from Thailand, or 
any place other than the American South. It would be interesting to 
know how much "integration" there is in the famous, fashionable colleges 
and prep schools of New England. A recent newspaper report 
said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one 
thousand at Yale; that is, about one-half of one per cent, which 
looks pretty "tokenish" to me, especially in an institution which 
professes to be "national".   I must confess that I prefer 
the Liberal who is personally affected, who is willing to send his own 
children to a mixed school as proof of his faith. I leave out of account 
the question of the best interests of the children, the question 
of what their best interests really are. I'm talking about the grand 
manner of the Liberal- North <and> South- who is not affected 
personally. If these people were denied a voice (do they have a 
moral right to a voice?), what voices would be left? Who is involved 
<willy nilly?> Well, after everybody has followed the New England 
pattern of segregating one's children into private schools, 
only the poor folks are left. And it is precisely in this poorer economic 
class that one finds, and has always found, the most racial friction.

A dear, respected friend of mine, who like myself grew up 
in the South and has spent many years in New England, said to me 
not long ago: "I can't forgive New England for rejecting 
all complicity". Being a teacher of American literature, I remembered 
Whittier's "Massachusetts to Virginia", where he said: 
"But that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone, 
And reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown". There 
is a legend (Hawthorne records it in his "English Notebooks". and 
one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page) to the effect that the 
<Mayflower> 
on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves. Whether 
historically a fact or not, the legend has a certain symbolic value.

<Complicity> is an embarrassing word. It is something 
which most of us try to get out from under. Like the cowboy in Stephen 
Crane's "Blue Hotel", we run around crying, "Well, I 
didn't do anything, did I"? Robert Penn Warren puts it this 
way in "Brother to Dragons": "The recognition of complicity 
is the beginning of innocence", where innocence, I think, means 
about the same thing as redemption. A man must be able to say, "Father, 
I have sinned", 
or there is no hope for him. Lincoln understood 
this better than most when he said in his "Second Inaugural" 
that God "gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the 
woe due to those by whom the offense came". He also spoke of "the 
wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited 
toil". Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that 
a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of 
the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade. After 
how many generations is such wealth (mounting all the while through 
the manipulations of high finance) purified of taint? It is a question 
which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds. But didn't 
they get off too easy? The slaves never shared in <their> profits, 
while they did share, in a very real sense, in the profits of the 
slave-owners: they were fed, clothed, doctored, and so forth; they 
were the beneficiaries of responsible, paternalistic care. 
Emerson- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire- sounded a high Transcendental 
note in his "Boston Hymn", delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music 
Hall amidst thundering applause: "Pay ransom to the owner and 
fill the bag to the brim. Who is the owner? The slave is owner, 
And ever was. Pay him"! It is the abstractionism, the unrealism, 
of the pure idealist. It ignores the sordid financial aspects (quite 
conveniently, too, for his audience, who could indulge in moral indignation 
without visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money 
from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic 
brokerage). Like Pilate, they had washed their hands. But can one, 
really? Can God be mocked, ever, in the long run?   New 
Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in 
Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, 
as Jefferson explained in his "Autobiography": "

The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa 
was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who 
had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on 
the contrary still wished to continue it. Our Northern brethren also 
I believe felt a little tender under those censures; for though their 
people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable 
carriers of them to others".   But that was a long 
time ago. The New England conscience became desensitized. George 
W& Cable (naturalized New Englander), writing in 1889 from "Paradise 
Road, Northampton" (lovely symbolic name), agitated continuously 
the "<Southern> question". It was nice to be able to isolate 
it. ##

New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster 
to the Nation. There one finds concentrated in a comparatively 
small area the chief universities, colleges, and preparatory schools 
of the United States. Why should this be so? It is true that New 
England, more than any other section, was dedicated to education 
from the start. But I think that something more than this is involved.

How did it happen, for example, that the state university, 
that great symbol of American democracy, failed to flourish in New England 
as it did in other parts of the country? Isn't it a bit odd 
that the three states of Southern New England (Massachusetts, Connecticut, 
and Rhode Island) have had state institutions of university 
status only in the very recent past, these institutions having previously 
been ~A+~M colleges? Was it supposed, perchance, that 
~A+~M (vocational training, that is) was quite sufficient for the 
immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in 
the post-Civil War period, the immigrants having been brought in from 
Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for the labor 
shortage caused by migration to the West? Is it not ironical that 
Roger Williams's state, Rhode Island, should have been the very 
last of the forty-eight to establish a state university? The state 
universities of Maine, New Hampshire, And Vermont are older and more 
"respectable"; they had less immigration to contend with.

A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in <The Yale Review>, 
said: "We in New England have long since segregated our children". 
He was referring not only to the general college situation 
but more especially to the preparatory schools. And what a galaxy of 
those adorns that fair land! I don't propose to go into their history, 
but I have one or two surmises. One is that they were established, 
or gained eminence, under pressure provided by these same immigrants, 
from whom the old families wished to segregate their children. 
In the early days of a homogeneous population, the public school was 
quite satisfactory.

AMONG THE RECIPIENTS of the Nobel Prize for Literature 
more than half are practically unknown to readers of English. Of these 
there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than 
Verner von Heidenstam, the Swedish poet and novelist who received 
the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago. 
Equally a master of prose and verse, he recreates the glory of Sweden 
in the past and continues it into the present. In the following sketch 
we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as 
possible speak for himself.   Heidenstam was born in 1859, of 
a prosperous family. On his father's side he was of German descent, 
on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility. The family 
estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Va^ttern in south central 
Sweden. It is a lonely, rather desolate region, but full of legendary 
and historic associations. As a boy in a local school he was shy 
and solitary, absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of 
Sweden's ancient glory. He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain 
and to dress for the part. Being somewhat delicate in health, at the 
age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once 
developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten 
years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, 
and Palestine. In one of his summers at home he married, to the 
great disapproval of his father, who objected because of his extreme youth.

Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio of Gerome 
in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the artists, but soon found 
that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction. 
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem, "The 
Happy Artists". "I scanned the world through printed symbol 
swart, And through the beggar's rags I strove to see The inner man. 
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind and with my burning heart". 
In this final line, we have the key to his nature. Few writers 
have better understood their deepest selves. Heidenstam could never be 
satisfied by surface. It may, however, be noted that his gift for color 
and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.

The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was 
a volume of poems, <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years (Vallfart och vandringsar),> 
published in 1888. It was a brilliant debut, so much so 
indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's 
<Childe Harold>. Professor Fredrik Bo^o^k, Sweden's 
foremost critic of the period, acclaims it as follows: "In 
this we have the verse of a painter; strongly colorful, plastic, racy, 
vivid. In a bold, sometimes careless, form there is nothing academic; 
all is seen and felt and experienced, the observation is sharp 
and the imagination lively. The young poet-painter reproduces the French 
life of the streets; he tells stories of the Thousand and One 
Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus. In the 
care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the 
old happy existence, and for that reason he loves it. And yet amid all 
the gay hedonism in <Pilgrimage and Wander-Years> is a cycle of 
short poems, "Thoughts in Loneliness", filled with brooding, melancholy, 
and sombre longing".   Of the longer pieces of the volume 
none is so memorable as "Nameless and Immortal", which at 
once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language. 
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of 
Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian 
classic style now in existence. On the eve of his return to their 
native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises 
before them in its completed perfection. The supreme object of their 
lives is now fulfilled, says the wife, her husband has achieved immortality. 
Not so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple 
that is immortal. "The man's true reputation is his work".

The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as "Thoughts 
in Loneliness" is, as Professor Bo^o^k indicated, in sharp contrast 
with the others. It consists of fragmentary personal revelations, 
such as "The Spark": "There is a spark dwells deep within 
my soul. To get it out into the daylight's glow Is my life's 
aim both first and last, the whole. It slips away, it burns and tortures
