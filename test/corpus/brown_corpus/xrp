
"I never heard that".   "It's all over Branchville. 
If you'd get out of your back yard once in a while you might even 
get her your ownself".   "I might try it one of these days", 
Jack said wonderingly, thinking of Miss Langford. ##

WHEN 
THEY reached the school, a gang of boys and girls were already 
there playing "crack the whip" in front of the schoolhouse. Miss 
Langford, in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandals, without 
socks, was out there with them, trying to get them inside.   "Time 
for books", she yelled, jingling a little five-and-dime store 
bell in her right hand. "Let's go inside".   "Oh, come 
on Miss Langford, play with us just onct", one of the little girls 
begged, smiling wistfully.   "No, not now", said the teacher. 
"Maybe at dinner time. Come inside now".   The children 
grudgingly stopped playing then and straggled into the schoolhouse.

Jack watched Miss Langford all morning. He could think of nothing 
else save his mental image of her nude figure and what Charles 
had said that morning about Margaret Rider. Occasionally he would 
look across the aisle at Margaret, fourteen and demure in a fresh green 
organdy dress, sitting in the sixth-grade row, and he coud hardly believe 
she would do what Charles had said she did.   At noontime, 
remembering what the teacher had said about maybe playing with the 
kids, Jack stayed close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boys, 
except Charles, went off out the road to play ball. "Why ain't 
you playin' ball"? he asked Charles suspiciously as they sat 
in the well-house shade, watching the girls congregate in front of the 
schoolhouse. "Miss Langford, come out and play with us like you 
promised", several of the little girls called.   "I'd druther 
stay here and watch the girls", Charles grinned. "Maybe some 
of 'em will fall down and we'll see up their dress".   "Maybe", 
Jack said idly, watching for Miss Langford.   Presently 
she came out of the schoolhouse. When she appeared, two or three 
of the little girls jumped up and down, yelling, "Goody, goody".

"Let's play with 'em", Jack said, rising from where 
he sat on the ground and dusting off his overall pants.   "O&K&" 
Charles rose also, and the two of them moved over to join 
the girls.   They played crack the whip a few minutes without mishap. 
Then when Miss Langford was on the end of the line of girls, 
Jack, in the middle of the line, gave an extra hard pull and the young 
teacher sprawled backwards, sitting down hard, her dress flying over 
her head. While she was struggling to get her skirt down and get 
on her feet again, Jack ran over, offered her his hand and said, "Gosh, 
I'm sorry, Miss Langford. I didn't mean to pull so hard".

"That's all right", she said, tossing her head back 
to get the hair out of her eyes. "It was my fault". With one hand 
she held her skirt down while she took Jack's extended hand with 
the other. When her hand touched his, fire went through Jack and he 
felt weak, but he managed somehow to get her on her feet. He thought 
she gave him that look with the hidden something in it as he let her hand 
go.   "Thank you", she said, dusting herself off. 
"Will you play with us again, Miss Langford"? one of the little 
girls said.   "No more today. Maybe some other day".

"Oh, shucks", the girl said. "I don't believe I'll 
play any more neither".   "Me neither", others said, and soon 
the game broke up, the children going off in pairs, in larger groups 
and alone.   Jack walked off alone out the road in the searing 
midday sun, past Robert Allen's three-room, tarpapered house, toward 
the field where the other boys were playing ball, thinking of what 
he would do in order to make Miss Langford have him stay in after 
school- because this was the day he had decided when he thought he saw 
the look in her eyes.   When he came back to the schoolhouse, 
his mind was made up. He simply would not work his arithmetic problems 
when the teacher held his class. That should do it, he thought, because 
Miss Langford had said she was going to be strict about school 
work. He had considered throwing erasers or flipping paperwads at someone 
or pulling the hair of the girl sitting in front of him, but he 
couldn't take a chance on either of these possibilities: the teacher 
probably would make him stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay 
in after school.   The only drawback now to the plan he'd 
decided on was that someone else might fail to do his work, too, and the 
teacher would have that person stay late along with Jack. "But 
I've got to take a chance on it", he told himself desperately.

To his surprise his plan worked perfectly. "All right, if you 
can't do your arithmetic during school hours you can do it after school 
it out", Miss Langford said firmly, not smiling. "You will 
stay here thirty minutes after the others go home this afternoon and 
work your problems".   And so when the others stampeded out that 
afternoon 
Jack remained docilely in his seat near a window, looking out in 
what he hoped was a pitiable manner, while the other kids laughed and 
yelled in at him and made faces as they dispersed, going home. He scarcely 
saw them. His heart was pounding like a mighty dynamo and he was 
trying to think, his mind seeming to scream at him like a hurt or frightened 
child, "How will I do it?

On the fringe of the amused throng of white onlookers stood a 
young woman of remarkable beauty and poise. She munched little ginger 
cakes called mulatto's belly and kept her green, somewhat hypnotic 
eyes fixed on a light-colored male who was prancing wildly with a 5-foot 
king snake wrapped around his bronze neck.   The youth with 
the snake had a natural pride and joy of life which appealed to the woman. 
Lithe and muscular, he had well-molded features, and his light 
color told of the European ancestors who had been intimate with the slave 
women of his family.   The haughty white girl turned to a distinguished, 
hawk-faced man standing at her side and murmured: "Look 
at your watch, Col& Garvier. It is almost time for and calinda 
to begin".   Col& Henri Garvier was one of New Orleans' 
most important and enlightened slave owners. He chuckled and gave 
the signal for the dance to start. The slaves ran gaily to the center 
of Congo Square and gathered around a sweaty youth they called Johnny 
No-Name.   Johnny vigorously pounded two bleached steer 
bones against the gourd which served as his drum. He showed his gleaming 
tusks of teeth and bellowed incoherently, his brass earrings jangling 
discordantly as he shook and trembled in ecstasy.   The 
drummer 
flogged the gourd with frantic intensity as the dancers began the calinda, 
a sensual gyration which had long been a favorite of voodoo practitioners 
and their disciples in the Louisiana slave compounds. The 
dance was of Haitian origin.   The white girl with the penetrating 
green eyes sipped the lemonade handed to her by a handsome man of 
about 30, who had coppery skin and beetling eyebrows. He was possessive 
in his manner and, though a slave, obviously was educated after a 
fashion and imitated the manners of his owners. He proudly wore the 
blue livery of her house, for the girl was Madame Delphine Lalaurie, 
wife of the prominent surgeon, Dr& Louis Lalaurie, who bore one 
of the South's oldest and most cherished names.   Delphine was 
a pace-setter in high society. She was a top horsewoman and one of 
the city's most gracious hostesses. Although New Orleans was not 
to learn of it for a spell, she also was a sadist, a nymphomaniac and 
unobtrusively mad- the perpetrator of some of the worst crimes against 
humanity ever committed on American soil.   Madame Lalaurie 
gestured with her riding crop toward the 20-year-old youth who was 
stomping and writhing with the king snake still draped over his bare shoulders. 
The slender, handsome fellow was called Dandy Brandon by 
the other slaves. He was gifted with animal magnetism and a potent allure 
for women of any race. But Dandy had had little experience with 
girls on his master's plantation in Bayou St& John.   Shy, 
actually, he avoided feminine overtures and seemed truly ignorant 
of the girls' desires when they sought to make liaisons with him in 
the open fields, in carriages and in boathouses.   This young slave 
was therefore quite unprepared when Delphine Lalaurie signaled 
that she wanted him to draw near. The woman eyed the youth with the 
avidity a coin collector might display toward a rare doubloon which is 
not yet in his collection.   "What is your name, boy? Come 
a bit closer. I won't bite, you know".   He gaped at Madame 
Lalaurie and sniffed the Paris perfume which emanated from her. Then 
he smiled shyly. "My name is Dandy Brandon, missy. I belong 
to Master Alexander Prieur".   She said with intense feeling: 
"Come near, let me feel your arms. You look quite strong and 
healthy to me, Dandy".   Mrs& Lalaurie impatiently propelled 
the slave toward her waiting carriage. Lifting her skirts, she climbed 
in, never relinquishing her grip on his arm. The woman seemed utterly 
unafraid of the snake which coiled on the floor in a torpor.

Once inside the luxuriosly-upholstered landau, she drew the curtains 
and proceeded to give the startled youth the kind of physical examination 
usually reserved for army inductees. Satisfied at last, and 
after a few amorous gambits on her part which convinced Delphine that 
Dandy was capable of learning new arts, she opened the window and called 
to her liveried driver. This was the big man with the proprietory 
air and the beetling, shaggy eyebrows.   "Aristide! I 
want you 
to find <Monsieur> Prieur at once and give him this money for the 
boy's purchase. There's $600 in gold in this chamois sack. If the 
old fool argues about the price, tell him I shall order my husband 
not to treat him as a patient any longer. Prieur has gout and depends 
on Louis' pills and bleedings. Besides, he owns 300 slaves. 
One 
less shouldn't matter to him".   Aristide Devol, the sardonic 
manservant who had been brought in chains years before from his native 
Sierra Leone, smiled thinly and touched his well-brushed beaver 
hat. His bold eyes raked the woman, and a perceptive spectator might 
sense that there was more to their relationship than that of slave to 
owner.   "Another youth, Madame"? the coachman said softly. 
"This one is a tender chicken, <oui?> Such delicate beauty, 
such fine flesh. It will rip and shred easily for Madame". 
"Be quiet, Devol! You are forgetting your place".   The 
tall coachman walked off briskly in search of Alexander Prieur. Delphine 
Lalaurie took the reins in her gloved hands and drove Dandy 
Brandon- cowering in the back seat of the carriage- to her mansion 
at 677 Perdido Street.   Dr& Louis Lalaurie stood on the 
veranda at the head of the driveway and watched his carriage as it approached 
the pillared mansion. Dandy, curiosity overcoming his apprehensions, 
peered out at the doctor from the window of the vehicle. He 
saw a pint-sized man with a graying spade beard and an unusually large 
head. Dr& Lalaurie wore a maroon smoking jacket, and his myopic 
eyes were blurry and glistened behind thick octagonal lenses. He was 
about 50 years old.   "Another young man, my dear? Really, 
you are most indiscreet to drive him here yourself", he said, frowning 
with displeasure.   Delphine presented her cheek for a kiss, 
and the physician pecked it like a timid rooster.   "Dandy is 
to be our house guest, Louis. I want the room in the attic prepared 
for him He is a most unusual lad, quite precocious in many ways. He 
deserves a better life than just rotting away on the Prieur plantation".

"Quite so, my dear. His room will be ready shortly".

The physician led the horses to the stable after a cursory 
glance at the cringing slave. Had Dandy been older or wiser, instinct 
might have warned him that he would be well advised to flee from the 
Lalauries' tender care if he valued his life.   But he liked 
the smell of Delphine's perfume. Besides, her endearments and caresses 
in the carriage had been new and stirring experiences to the simple
