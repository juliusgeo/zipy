Atonement, if atonement were possible, could only be made at that sacred, 
sacrificial basin. It was there that she would have to enact her 
renunciation, beg forgiveness.   Perhaps it was insane, Pamela 
thought. Perhaps it was all a vividly conceived dream. But she was 
caught in it, and she faced the terrible possibility that, if it were 
a dream, it was one from which she might never awaken.   Facing 
the forest now, she who had not dared to enter it before, walked between 
two trees at random and headed in what she believed was the direction 
of the pool. She remembered little of her previous journey there with 
Grace, and she could but hope that her dedication to her mission 
would enable her to accomplish it.   The forest was open and freely 
welcoming, extending an enchanted hand. The ground was covered with 
soft pine needles and the slope was gentle. Birds chirped and chattered 
in the trees and the sun, all dewy-eyed and soft, caressed her shoulders 
warmly from time to time. It was not, thought Pamela, such 
an evil place after all. No wonder Melissa responded so completely to 
its beckoning.   Perhaps she had no reason to fear these trees 
that whispered their secrets above her head as she passed. Was it not 
possible, after all, that the forest was in league with her and her 
child **h that its sympathy lay with the Culvers **h that she had erred 
in failing to understand this?   Pamela felt calm and peaceful 
as she walked along. The slight flutter that had disturbed the motion 
of her heart when she entered the forest was gone now, and even the 
dim groves of trees through which she occasionally passed did not reawaken 
her fear. She regarded them as signs that she was nearing the 
glen she sought, and she was glad to at last be doing something positive 
in her unenunciated, undefined struggle with the mountain and its 
darkling inhabitants.   Having persisted too long in deliberate 
ignorance and denial of the forces that threatened her, Pamela was relieved 
now to admit their potency and to be taking definite steps toward 
grappling with them. A few days ago, she would have thought such an 
expedition as this utterly ridiculous; today, on the contrary, it 
seemed utterly reasonable.   She did not pause to consider what 
she would do if her plan should fail; she directed all of her mental 
and physical energy toward achieving this one goal. If, as she walked, 
her steps fumbled from time to time, she chose to ignore that omen. 
If the slope grew steeper and the groves more dim, she tried not to 
heed. Success depended upon maintaining her equanimity; she must be 
poised and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that 
she was in earnest.   The forest took on an impersonal aspect. 
It did not care what sort of person prowled its woods, plucked at its 
bark or stripped the berries from its bushes. Unconcerned, indifferent, 
unmotivated, the forest was simply there- fighting man's depredations 
with more abundant growth and man's follies with its own musical 
evening laughter. Red man or white man, pacifist or killer, the 
forest would accept them all- knowing that it could thrive equally 
well on slaughter and beneficence; knowing that its ageless mass would 
always dwarf the short span of time allotted to any man.   Pamela 
shook her head. She must not think about time. That was another 
one of those traps.   In her grim pursuit of tranquillity, Pamela 
focused her thoughts on her husband. If, when this was all over, she 
found the words to tell him about it, she wondered if he would ever 
understand. How could he comprehend her need when he himself was innocent? 
Indian ghosts would not impinge upon his nights, nor would his 
days be haunted by the dimly-outlined, ill-conceived figure of her 
benighted ancestor. His bright, daylight mind would whistle away such 
images; they would not dare to face his scoffing.   Pamela was 
glad Jim was nowhere near. His presence would have interfered with 
her duty.   The mountainside grew steeper and she slipped once 
or twice on the smooth pine needles. The trees huddled more closely together, 
their limbs and leaves intertwined in a coarse curtain against 
the sun. Bushes and vines abetted the rocks in forming thorny detours 
for the 
struggling stranger, and without the direct light of the sun to 
act as compass, Pamela could no longer be positive of her direction.

Nevertheless, she continued to move upward. She was sure she 
would reach the pool by climbing, and she clung to that belief despite 
the increasing number of obstacles. The forest had become an alien 
world where she strove, alone, unprotected, unguided, to deal with whatever 
hindrances were offered. It was a bold, dark castle of pine boughs 
that stood like a medieval fortress, eclipsing the sun and human 
time. At one and the same time, she was within it but still searching 
for the drawbridge that would give her entry.   Silence came into 
the forest- a solid being that clapped its hand over the murmuring 
mouths of the birds and the whispered comfort of the trees. Silence 
walked at Pamela's side, its presence numbingly close, yet too far 
for her to hear. Silence stood in front of her, waiting, and in back 
of her, blocking her retreat.   She stumbled over the root of a 
tree that protruded maliciously above the earth. In spite of her attempt 
to preserve her balance, she fell, bruising her arm on a naked stone. 
For a moment, she could not catch her breath and then, her breath 
returning in short, frightened spasms, she lifted herself to her feet 
laboriously. She started to brush the dirt and bits of leaves off her 
clothes. Her arm bled slightly, and the offended skin cried out in 
pain.   She looked around. She was bewildered. She seemed to 
have come such a long distance- too far for her destination which had 
wilfully been swallowed up in the greedy gloom of the trees. She stood 
quite still, trying to focus upon a direction in which to turn, a 
path to follow, a clue to guide her.   She was standing in a thick 
grove. The trees were crowded so closely together that their branches 
overlapped, virtually shutting out the sun completely. The earth 
smelled moist and pungent as it might in a cave deprived of the cleansing 
effect of the sun's rays. She had the feeling that, under the mouldering 
leaves, there would be the bodies of dead animals, quietly decaying 
and giving their soil back to the mountain.   The thought 
made Pamela shudder. A terrible chill swept through the grove. Not 
a breeze exactly, but a pocket of icy air that settled with a loathsome 
familiarity upon the deep confines of the grove, catching Pamela 
in a leering embrace. There was a peculiar density about it, a thick 
substance that could be sensed but never identified, never actually perceived.

Where before had she felt or dreamt or imagined such 
a scene? She already knew this unwholesome, chilling atmosphere that 
was somehow grotesquely alive. It enclosed her clammy hands and twined 
around her ankles. It crept into the open neck of her blouse and 
slid down her body, seeping into her flesh through all the quivering pores 
of her skin. It crawled across her breasts, suffocating the life 
in her nipples. It circled her thighs, exploring with its icy tentacles. 
It entered her body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus, and 
its particles, spreading, creeping, crawling, joined themselves into 
steel bands that constricted her knees so tightly that they ached; stifled 
her lungs so that her breath came in harsh gasps; clutched her 
throat and sucked up the moisture in her mouth so that her tongue was 
dry and hard and stuck to the roof of her mouth and her teeth were clenched 
together in the rigid fixture of her jaws.   She had to 
get away from here before this demoniac possession swallowed up the liquid 
of her eyes and sank into the fibers of her brain, depriving her 
of reason and sight. But she did not know which way to go. The shadows 
of the trees engulfed her, foreclosing every possible exit from the 
grove. She had been snared here by a vile sensuality that writhed around 
her throat in ever-tightening circles.   She could not scream, 
for even if a sound could take shape within her parched mouth, who 
would hear, who would listen?   Does the mountain listen?

Pamela groped blindly. She had to escape. She had to move in 
some direction- any direction that would take her away from this evil 
place.   She thrust forward through the shadows and the trees 
that resisted her and tried to fling her back. Her own body protested, 
aching painfully where the blood in her veins had congealed, where cold 
demon wisps still clung and caressed.   Every movement she made 
seemed unnecessarily noisy. Twigs cracked loudly under her feet; 
bushes swished and scratched at her slacks; tree branches snapped 
as she pushed them ruthlessly away from her.

Miraculously, she found exactly the right statement. She began 
it deliberately, so that none of her words would be lost on him.

"I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord. I'm 
well aware that you've got a pedigree as long as my leg, and that I 
don't amount to anything. But"-   "But it don't matter 
a-tall", Lord supplied fondly. "To me you'll always be the 
girl o' my dreams, an' the sweetest flower that grows".   Beaming 
idiotically, he pooched out his lips and attempted to kiss her. 
She yanked away from him furiously.   "You shut up! <shu-tt 
up-pp!> I've got something to say to you, and by God you're 
going to listen. Do you hear me? You're going to listen"!

Lord nodded agreeably. He said he wanted very much to listen. 
He knew that anything a brainy little lady like her had to say would 
be plumb important, as well as pleasin' to the ear, and he didn't 
want to miss a word of it. So would she mind speaking a little louder?

"I think you stink, Tom Lord! I think you're mean 
and hateful and stupid, and- louder"? said Joyce.   "Uh-huh. 
So I can hear you while I'm checkin' the car. Looks 
like we might be in for a speck of trouble".   He opened the 
door and got out. He waited at the car side for a moment, looking down 
at her expectantly.   "Well? Wasn't you goin' to say 
somethin'"? Then, helpfully, as she merely stared at him in weary 
silence, "Maybe you could write it down for me, huh? Print it 
in real big letters, an' I can cipher it out later".   "Aah, 
go on", she said. "Just go the hell on".   He grinned, 
nodded, and walked around to the front of the car. Lips pursed mournfully, 
he stared down at its crazily sagging left side. Then he hunkered 
down on the heels of his handmade boots, peered into the orderly 
chaos of axle, shock absorber, and spring.   He went prone on 
his stomach, the better to pursue his examination. After a time, he straightened 
again, brushing the red Permian dust from his hands, slapping 
it from his six-dollar levis and his tailored, twenty-five-dollar 
shirt.   He wore no gun- a strange ommission for a peace officer 
in this country. Never, he'd once told Joyce, had he encountered 
any man or situation that called for a gun. <And he really feels 
that way>, she thought. <That's really all he's got, all he is. 
Just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package. If 
I could make myself feel the same way> **h   She studied him 
hopefully, yearningly; against the limitless background of sky and wasteland 
it was easy to confirm her analysis. Here in the God-forsaken 
place, the westerly end of nowhere, Tom Lord looked almost insignificant, 
almost contemptible.   He <was> handsome, with his coal-black 
hair and eyes, his fine-chiseled features. But she'd known 
plenty of handsomer guys, and, conceding his good looks, what was there 
left? He wasn't a big man; rather on the medium side. Neither 
was he very powerful of build. He could move very quickly, she knew 
(although he seldom found occasion to do so), but he was more wiry than 
truly strong. And his relatively small hands and feet gave him an 
almost delicate appearance.   <Just nothing>, she told herself. 
<Just so darned sure of himself that he puts the Indian sign on 
everyone. But, by gosh, I want him and I'm going to have him!>

He caught her eye, came back around the car with the boot-wearer's 
teetering, half-mincing walk. <Why did these yokels still wear 
boots, anyway, when most had scarcely sat a horse in years?> He 
slid in at her side, tucked a cigar into his mouth, and politely proffered 
one to her.   "Oh, cut it out, Tom"! she snapped. "Can't 
you stop that stupid clowning for even a minute"? 
"This ain't your brand, maybe", Lord suggested. "Or maybe 
you just don't feel like a cigar"?   "I feel like getting 
back to town, that's what I feel like! Now, are you going to take 
me or am I supposed to walk"?   "Might get there faster
