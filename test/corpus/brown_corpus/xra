But he brought back the sheriff and several deputies, and to the lawmen 
the entire affair seemed a repetition of the Lewis killing.

A detailed scouring of the entire area revealed nothing beyond a 
ledge of rocks that might have been the rifleman's hiding place. There 
were no tracks of either hoofs or boots. Not even an empty cartridge 
case could be found.   Once again, Tom Horn was the first 
and most likely suspect, and he was brought in for questioning immediately. 
Once again, he shook his head, kept his face expressionless and 
his voice very calm, and had a strongly supported alibi ready. Later, 
riding in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional ladies 
of Cheyenne, he laid claim to the killing with the vague insinuations 
he made.   "Exterminatin' cow thieves is just a business 
proposition with me", he'd blandly announce. "And I sort o' 
got a corner on the market".   "Tom", a friend asked him 
once, "how come you bushwhacked them rustlers? They wouldn't 
o' stood no chance with you in a plain, straight-out shoot-down".

He had lots of friends, then as always. Even as he became widely 
known as a professional killer, nearly every cowboy and rancher in 
Wyoming seemed proud to call him a friend. No man's name brought 
more cheers when it was announced in a rodeo.   "Well", he 
explained, 
"s'posin' you was a nester swingin' the long rope? 
Which would you be most scairt of- a dry-gulchin' or a shoot-down"?

"Yeah, I can see that", the friend was forced to 
agree. "But **h well, it just don't seem sportin' somehow"!

"Sportin'"! The tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stared 
in amazement. "Sportin'"! he echoed again in soft wonder. "I 
seen a lot o' things in my time. I found a trooper once the Apache 
had spread-eagled on an ant hill, and another time we ran across 
some teamsters they'd caught, tied upside down on their own wagon wheels 
over little fires until their brains was exploded right out o' 
their skulls. I heard o' Texas cattlemen wrappin' a cow thief up 
in green hides and lettin' the sun shrink 'em and squeeze him to 
death. But there's one thing I never seen or heard of, one thing 
I just don't think there is, and that's a sportin' way o' killin' 
a man"!   After the first two murders, the warning notes 
were rarely ignored. The lesson had been learned. The examples were 
plain. When Fred Powell's brother-in-law, Charlie Keane, moved 
into the dead man's home, the anonymous letter writer took no chances 
on Charlie taking up where Fred had left off and wasted no time 
on a first notice:   <IF YOU DON'T LEAVE THIS COUNTRY 
WITHIN 3 DAYS, YOUR LIFE WILL BE TAKEN THE SAME AS POWELL'S WAS>.

This was the message found tacked to the cabin door. Keane 
left, within three days.   All through Albany and Laramie counties, 
other men were doing the same. Houses of settlers who'd treated 
the company herds as a natural resource, free for the taking, were 
sitting empty, with weeds growing high in their yards. The small half-heartedly 
tended fields of men who'd spent more time rustling cattle 
than farming were lying fallow. No cow thief could count on a jury 
of his sympathetic peers to free him any longer. Jury, judge and executioner 
were riding the range in the form of a single unknown figure 
that could materialize anywhere, at any time, to dispense an ancient 
brand of justice the men of the new West had believed long outdated.

For three straight years, Tom Horn patrolled the southern Wyoming 
pastures, and how many men he killed after Lewis and Powell 
(if he killed Lewis and Powell) will never be known. It is possible, 
although highly doubtful, that he killed none at all but merely let 
his reputation work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder 
in the state. It is also possible, but equally doubtful, that he actually 
shot down the hundreds of men with which his legend credits him.

For that legend was growing explosively, Rumor was insisting 
he received a price of $600 a man. (The best evidence is that he received 
a monthly wage of about $125, very good money in an era when top 
hands worked for $30 and found.) Rumor had it he slipped two small 
rocks under each victim's head as a sort of trademark. (A detailed 
search of old coroner's reports fails to substantiate this in the slightest.)

One thing was certain- his method was effective, so 
effective that after a time even the warning notices were often unnecessary. 
The mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field 
glasses had been seen riding that way was enough to frighten three rustling 
homesteaders out of the Upper Laramie country in a single week.

"My reputation's my stock in trade", Tom mentioned more 
than once. He evidently couldn't foresee that it might be his downfall 
in the end.   He had made himself the personification of the 
Devil to the homesteaders. But to the cattlemen who had been facing 
bankruptcy from rustling losses and to the cowboys who had been faced 
with lay-offs a few years earlier, he was becoming a vastly different 
type of legendary figure. Such ranchers as Coble and Clay and the 
Bosler brothers carried him on their books as a cowhand even while 
he was receiving a much larger salary from parties unknown. He made their 
spreads his headquarters, and he helped out in their roundups.

In the cow camps, Tom Horn was regarded as a hero, as the same 
kind of champion he was when he entered and invariably won the local 
rodeos. The hands and their bosses saw him as a lone knight of the range, 
waging a dedicated crusade against a lawless new society that was 
threatening a beloved way of life. The wailing, guitar-strumming minstrels 
of the cattle kingdom made up songs about him.   By 1898, 
rustling losses had been driven down to the lowest level ever seen in 
Wyoming.

When several minutes had passed and Curt hadn't emerged from 
the livery stable, Brenner reentered the hotel and faced Summers across 
the counter.   "I have a little job for you, Charlie. I'm 
sure you won't mind doing me a small favor".   Brenner's 
voice was oily, but Summers wasn't fooled. He moistened his lips 
uneasily.   "What is it you want me to do, Mr& Brenner"?

Brenner shrugged carelessly.   "It's very simple. 
I just want you to take a message to Diane Molinari. Tell her 
to come here to the hotel".   Vastly relieved, Summers nodded 
and started toward the door.   "One thing, Summers", Brenner 
said. "You're not to mention my name. Tell her Curt Adams 
wants to see her".   Summers pulled up short, and turned around.

"I don't know, Mr& Brenner", he said haltingly, 
beginning to get an inkling of Brenner's plans. "It doesn't seem 
quite right, telling her a thing like that. Couldn't I just"- 
His voice trailed off into silence.   Brenner continued to smile, 
but his eyes were cold. He turned and looked around at the lobby 
as though seeing things he hadn't before noticed.   "You know, 
Summers", he said thoughtfully. "Eagle's Nest ought to have 
a fire company. If someone were to drop a match in here, this place 
would go up like a haystack". He started toward the stairway, then 
turned to add, "Tell her to come to Adams's room, that Adams 
is in trouble. Tell her to hurry".   "Yes sir". His face 
pale, Summers headed for the street. ##

Curt's visit to the 
livery stable had been merely a precaution in case anyone should be watching. 
He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess's buckskin 
was still missing and that his own gray was all right, then climbed 
through a back window and dropped to the ground outside.   The 
fact that Jess's horse had not been returned to its stall could indicate 
that Diane's information had been wrong, but Curt didn't interpret 
it this way. A man like Jess would want to have a ready means 
of escape in case it was needed. Probably his horse would be close 
to where he was hiding.   From the back of the barn it was a simple 
matter to reach Black's house without using the street. Curt 
approached the place cautiously, and watched it several minutes from the 
protection of a grove of trees.   There was a light in Black's 
front room, but drawn curtains prevented any view of the interior. 
Curt circled the house and located a barn out back. He could hear 
horses moving around inside, and nothing else. There was no lock on the 
door, only an iron hook which he unfastened. He opened the door and 
went in, pulling it shut behind him.   Again he stood in the darkness 
listening, but there was only the scrape of a shod hoof on a plank 
floor. He moved ahead carefully, his left hand in front of him, 
and came to a wooden partition. Horse smell was very strong, and he could 
hear the crunch of grain being ground between strong jaws. He found 
a match in his pocket and lit it.   There were two horses in 
the barn, a sway-backed dun and Jess Crouch's buckskin. Curt snuffed 
out the match.   It was certain now that Jess was in the house, 
but also, presumably, was Stacey Black. Curt wanted to get Jess 
alone, without interference from anyone, even as spineless a person 
as the store owner.   He studied the problem for a few seconds 
and thought of a means by which it might be solved. Reaching across 
the side of the stall, he slapped the buckskin on the rump. The startled 
animal let out a terrified squeal and thrashed around in the stall.

As Curt had hoped, the house door banged open. He slapped 
the buckskin again and it kicked wildly, its hoofs rattling the side of 
the stall.   Curt moved over beside the door and waited. Presently 
he heard footsteps crossing the yard, and Jess's smothered curses. 
The door swung open, and Jess said sourly, "What the hell's 
the matter with <you?">   The horse continued to snort. 
Curt doubted that any animal belonging to Jess would find much reassurance 
in its owner's voice.   Jess cursed again, and entered 
the barn. A match flared, and he reached above his head to light a lantern 
which hung from a wire loop. As he crossed to the side of the 
stall, Curt drew his gun and clicked back the hammer.   "Before 
you try anything", he said. "Remember what happened to Gruller".

Jess caught his breath in surprise. He started to reach 
for his gun, but apparently thought better of it.   "That's 
the stuff", Curt said. "Just hold it that way". He reached out 
to pull the door shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt. "You and 
I have a little talking to do, Jess. You won't be needing this". 
He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster.

"Damn you, Adams"- Jess was beginning to recover from his initial 
shock. "We ain't got nothing to talk about. If I don't 
come back in the house, Breed's going to"-   "Your trigger-happy 
brother isn't <in> the house. About now he's probably 
having supper. That long ride the four of you took must've given 
him a good appetite. Now turn around so I can see your face".

Jess turned. There was raw fury in his eyes, and the veins of his 
neck were swollen.   "You're about as dumb as they come, Adams. 
I don't know what you're up to, but when Brenner"-

"You can forget about Brenner, too", Curt said. "It's 
Ben Arbuckle we're going to talk about".   "Arbuckle"? 
Jess stiffened. "I don't know nothin' about him". 
"No? I suppose you don't know anything about a piece of two-by-four, 
either; one with blood all over it, Arbuckle's blood". 
Curt's fingers put a little more pressure on the trigger of his gun. 
"So help me, Crouch, I'd like to kill you where you stand, but, 
before I do, I'm going to hear you admit killing him. Now start 
talking. Who told you to do it? Was it Dutch Brenner"?
