till Myra finds a place for them".   "Well"- This time 
there was a long silence, while the telephone hummed faintly with 
a voiceless life.   Puzzled, Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper; 
her mother was forthright; she was not usually given to mysterious 
silences. Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was- that 
it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good? "You 
mean once Myra gets to Paris"? Once the soft, pretty moth 
found the bright light she had always wanted?   Suddenly, seekingly, 
Lucy asked, "Mother, do you know something I don't know"?

Again there was that curious pause, and then her mother 
said, "I guess I do. Just before Myra left- She was saying good-by 
to Cathy, and she didn't realize I was near". She hesitated, 
as though hunting over words and ways of putting them. "Cathy was 
in tears, of course, and I heard Myra say, 'Now be good, and at 
Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris'".

Shocked speechless, Lucy sat there. Then she jumped to her 
feet, the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake. "<Christmastime!>" 
Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up; it was 
only too true. Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in 
two weeks.   For a moment, anger darkened the hallway about her, 
and when she found her voice, anger thickened it. "That does it"! 
she said. "I'll keep Cathy for two weeks. Then, if Myra 
does nothing about fetching her, I'll pack her right back to her mother- 
if I have to take her myself"! Her hand tightened on the 
receiver. "And <that's> what I'm going to tell Jim". For 
Lucy, the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end.

As she hung up, she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black 
flying of the cowbirds' wings, and heard their grotesque singing. 
Cowbird Myra! She's not going to get away with it. ## 

CATHY is tired, Lucy thought, watching them come slowly up the 
path. The child's thin legs were plodding. She trudged along slowly, 
both hands clutching a tired teddy bear. She was at the moment just 
a small, walking package, being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's 
house. Unlike Susan, she was traveling light; the worn teddy 
bear, a tiny suitcase that Jim carried, and the clothes she wore, were 
all she had. Lucy glancing at the miniature case, knew there would 
not be enough in it for the shortest of stays; they would have 
to buy things for her. She opened the door.

Unimpressed, the dog plopped on the sand. Quint couldn't blame 
Maggie for disbelieving. For eleven days they'd done the same 
thing, leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast, before Esperanza 
Beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards. 
The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced. They walked 
slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages- eleven lemon, nine mint, 
seven orange- around the curve to a deserted stand with an "Eats" 
sign jiggling in the wind.   Now they were in friendly territory. 
Nobody around. Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping 
jaggedly to the water's edge. <His> rock was to the right of a 
~V-shaped inlet, a big, brown, lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers. 
His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here. 
Here he was enclosed and safe. (If a dragon or a sea monster came 
along, didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt- ten 
blades <and> a corkscrew?)   Here was a perfect place to lie 
down and make believe. He was Canute controlling the waves. He was 
a knight of the Round Table, "Sir Quintus the Brave", slaying 
evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses. 
(One good thing about a suit of armor, his leg wouldn't show.) He 
was the first astronaut on the moon, chosen because of his small size 
and intrepid nature. He was six feet one like his father, with big 
hands and a hairy chest, a man the weak and persecuted would turn to. 
Fearless. Every night when he wanted a drink of water, didn't he practice 
being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light? A dark 
bathroom can be pretty scary, and he'd creep back to bed, proud of 
himself, thinking: Tomorrow, for sure, I'll go down to the rock 
and keep my promise to Dad.   He hadn't intended to make the 
promise. It happened two weeks ago, the night before his father left 
on a business trip to South America. Every piece of the nightmare was 
clear, in place; and when he woke up, his father was saying, "Stop 
screaming, Quint. It's all right. Stop shaking".   He 
could remember the feel of his father's big hands, the thump of his 
father's heart sending out signals- regular, like radar. "Let's 
talk about the beach. Son. While I'm gone you get brown and 
fat as a pig, hear? Look, I can put two fingers between the cords 
in the back of your neck. Dr& Fortman says swimming would help your 
leg. He says you're limping more than you need to".   "How 
does he know? Big dumb nut. He never had polio".   In 
the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the 
promise spilled out. "You just wait, Dad. When you get back I'll 
probly be swimming better than Victoria. Wait and see, Dad".

Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint, a head taller, 
and could lick any boy or girl on the beach. He called her "Fatso". 
She called him "Stuck-up- that's why nobody plays with 
you, Mister Stuck-up". Or, what was worse, she prayed for him out 
loud at bedtime: "Please, Lord Gord, please give my brother the 
strength to go swimming like he promised".   "<She's> 
got a nerve". Quint said now to the clouds. Strength began to zip 
up and down his chest. He felt strong as a giant. He unlaced his high 
brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg. He wadded his 
sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks.

"Goolick, goooolick", creaked a sea gull.   "Aw, shut 
up", he said.   He stood on the rock, a skinny, dignified boy 
surrounded by the ocean. The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades, 
and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing 
each other he could see his head down there, bleeding, wedged between 
the rocks and the waves.   <I can't go in. I'm scared 
of the nightmare>. ##

Shivering, he put on his clothes. And shivering 
with shame, he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat 
into the water.   "Watch it, big shot", a hoarse voice yelled 
back. She was holding on to his rock with one hand. She smelled of 
peppermints. She wore a bathing suit like his mother's, no straps 
on the shouders.   "Why didn't you duck"? he snapped. 
"This is my rock".   "Isn't".   "Is".

"Isn't".   "Is".   She was sore as a boil. "Ever 
hear of squatter's rights"?   "Sure. They started 
with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen"-   "Mister 
Big Britches, aren't you"?   "I'm Mark Gordon Peters 
the Fifth. They call me Quint".   "Then why don't 
you stop squinting"?   "I said Quint. That's short for 
Quintus. Quintus in Latin means"-   "I can speak both 
kinds of Latin, smart aleck". Her cough sounded like cloth ripping.

"You shouldn't smoke so much", he said, unconsciously 
imitating Victoria's holier-than-thou voice.   "I don't 
smoke". She was horrified. "Do you"?   "Hell, yes". 
Not having said "hell" before, he stumbled a bit before gathering 
momentum. "Sometimes eleven, fourteen a day".   "If I 
was your mama, I'd wop your tail off".   "My mother never 
wops me. I've got this leg brace".   She seemed so unimpressed 
that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see 
his brace.   "Dingy-looking", was what she said. "Why don't 
you paint it red and white like a barber pole"?   "Because 
maybe I won't have to wear it always. Dr& Fortman says if 
I exercise my leg more, maybe I can use a cane when I'm big".

She spouted a mouthful of water into the air. "A cane's mighty 
handy. Someone's walking past, you want to stop him, <zoooop>, 
snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane. Or say a waiter 
brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it- all you got to 
do is <bannnnnng, 
stooooomp> your cane on the floor **h. Hey, will 
you look at that"?   Maggie had shaken himself awake and was 
licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail.

"That's some dog. What kind"?   "Part collie, 
part wire-haired terrier". Quint glared. He always did when people 
asked.   "Holy mackerel, that's the most unique dog <I> 
ever saw", she said firmly.   "His real name's DiMaggio, 
only we call him Maggie because he has to take tranquilizers. He's 
braver than he looks. He's been sick lately. Last Tuesday he 
went on a ham jag".   "A what"?   He would have told 
her, but Victoria was yodeling. That meant "Mama wants you Quint. 
Come home or I'll come find you".   "I gotta go. 
Even though this is my rock, you can use it sometimes. I come early 
in the morning".   "So do I. See you around, Mister Squint". 
##

That was how they started being friends. They met next 
morning and all the mornings thereafter. Same time, early, before 
the fog burned off, because she didn't like the sun; it made her 
blister. Her name was Sabella, and the strip of seaweed around her neck 
was an emerald necklace the King gave her as a token of his undying 
love.   "You going to marry the King"? "No. He's 
got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork. My hair is what he's 
nuts about. Naturally curly hair runs in my family. Personally, 
I prefer straight hair like yours, but as they say on the Continent, 
'What can one do'"?

"Which continent"? 
"Name one, I been there". Japan, she said, smelled <pugh> because 
people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as 
rocks; then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup. <Pugh>. 
Camels in Tripoli had harelips. Near Galway the tinkers drove their 
caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night. 
As for dancing- holy mackerel, he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez; 
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with 
them.   "Really". Quint smothered a yawn. She made better 
pictures than any book he'd read, but he didn't say so. Artfully, 
as the days went by, he found occasion to tell her that his father had 
won the Navy Cross in the Korean War; that his baby sister could 
spit up through her nose when she felt like it; that he personally 
had an ~IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon 
volume of the encyclopedia.   "Books are for schnooks". She 
skipped a piece of water at him and laughed, a funny, hoarse laugh he 
liked to hear.   Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as 
Sabella. ("What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil? Let's 
get dressed up- the doctor's taking us out tonight". And "What 
time did the Chinaman go to the dentist? Tooth-hurty".) Encouraged 
by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham. He 
described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries, cooling on 
the porch. He snuck up on the ham like Maggie, gumming it with soft, 
stumpy teeth, then panting with thirst, lapping up the water in the lagoon, 
swelling up like a balloon, staggering home to be sick, while his 
mother said, "<That> does it. That dog <has> to go".

"Say, you're quite a comic", Sabella said admiringly. "Ever 
thought about going on the stage"?   He hadn't. But it 
was such a nice thought that he nodded his head. "Either that or 
a veterinarian".   "Better make up your mind, son", Sabella 
said. "You can't serve cod and salmon".   Sometimes they 
argued. She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward. His
