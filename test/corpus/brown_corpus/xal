A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their 
future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of 
the Assemblies of God, in session at the Memorial Coliseum. 
The council revised, in an effort to strengthen, the denomination's 
16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.   The changes, unanimously adopted, 
were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the 
Bible. The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in 
and dependence on the Bible.   At the adoption, the Rev& T& 
F& Zimmerman, general superintendent, commented, "The Assemblies 
of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days 
and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths of the Bible 
for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives". 

#NEW POINT ADDED#

Many changes involved minor editing and clarification; 
however, the first belief stood for entire revision with a 
new third point added to the list.   The first of 16 beliefs of 
the denomination, now reads:   "The scriptures, both Old and 
New Testament, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation 
of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct".

The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the Diety 
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and:  - emphasizes the Virgin 
birth  - the sinless life of Christ  - His miracles 
  - His substitutionary work on the cross  - His bodily 
resurrection from the dead  - and His exaltation to the right 
hand of God. 

#SUPER AGAIN ELECTED#

Friday afternoon the Rev& 
T& F& Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year 
term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God. His offices 
are in Springfield, Mo&. Election came on the nominating ballot.

Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming 
program, "Breakthrough" scheduled to fill the churches for the 
next two years. In his opening address Wednesday the Rev& Mr& 
Zimmerman, urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program, 
with "Breakthrough" the theme for the first two years. 
The Rev& R& L& Brandt, national secretary of the home missions 
department, stressed the need for the first two years' work.

"Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact 
with the church. This means that more than 100 million have no vital 
touch with the church or religious life", he told delegates Friday. 

#CHURCH LOSES PACE#

Talking of the rapid population growth (upwards 
of 12,000 babies born daily) with an immigrant entering the United 
States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said "our organization has not 
been keeping pace with this challenge".   "In 35 years we have 
opened 7,000 churches", the Rev& Mr& Brandt said, adding that 
the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 
persons.   "In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois, 
where we have 200; 800 in Southern New England, we have 60; 
we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none", he said.   To step 
up the denomination's program, the Rev& Mr& Brandt suggested 
the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 
years.   To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods, 
he said. #'CHURCH MEETS CHANGE'#

"The church's 
ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet 
the challenge of this hour".   A capsule view of proposed plans 
includes:  - Encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies 
of God churches to start new churches.  - Engaging 
mature, experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population 
centers.  - Surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational 
volunteers (laymen, who will be urged to move into the area of new 
churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project). 
  - Arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months 
as apprentices in well-established churches.

U&S& Dist& Judge Charles L& Powell denied all motions 
made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud 
trial.   Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance, mistrial, 
separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony and directed 
verdict.   In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated 
that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that 
"a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators 
are".   Attorney Dwight L& Schwab, in behalf of 
defendant Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein 
to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared this is a matter 
for the jury to decide. 

#PROOF LACK CHARGED#

Schwab also declared 
there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the 
U&S& mails to defraud, to which federal prosecutor A& Lawrence 
Burbank replied:   "It is not necessary that a defendant 
actually have conpired to use the U&S& mails to defraud as long 
as there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were then used 
to carry it out".   In the afternoon, defense attorneys began 
the presentation of their cases with opening statements, some of which 
had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and 
presented its case. 

_MIAMI, FLA&, MARCH 17_- The Orioles tonight retained the distinction 
of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-League 
clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision, 
this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3.

Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds 
were to end their victory draought as they coasted along with a 3-to-o 
advantage. 

#SIEBERN HITS HOMER#

Over the first five frames, Jack 
Fisher, the big righthandler who figures to be in the middle of 
Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held 
the ~A's scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.   Then 
Dick Hyde, submarine-ball hurler, entered the contest and only 
five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock.

A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill 
Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the 
Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts. 

#HOUSE THROWS WILD# 

With one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole 
second as Hyde fanned Tuttle. Catcher Frank House's throw 
in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt.   Then 
Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled up the middle and 
Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run.

Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of 
the ninth and gave up the ~A's fifth tally on a walk to second baseman 
Dick Howser, a wild pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under 
Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center.   The Orioles 
once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion, gathering 
only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers. Three 
were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding 
one. 

#HARTMAN IMPRESSIVE#

Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed 
Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach 
to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.

The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before 
Hartman took over in the top of the fourth. Hartman, purchased 
by the ~A's from the Milwaukee Braves last fall, allowed no hits 
in his scoreless three-inning appearance, and merited the triumph.

Keegan, a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder, gave up the Orioles' last 
two safeties over the final three frames, escaping a load of trouble 
in the ninth when the Birds threatened but 
failed to tally. 

#ROBINSON 
DOUBLES AGAIN#

In the ninth, Robinson led off with his second 
double of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left.

Whitey Herzog, performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly 
their strongest team of the spring, worked Keegan for a base on 
balls.   Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce.

Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing in a bunt 
attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back of short.   John 
Powell, batting for Adair, fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches, 
and Buddy Barker, up for Stepanovich, bounced out sharply to 
Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest.

The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding, along with 
Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right 
center, moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed 
on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.

The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits 
after two were out.   Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole 
at short to start the rally. 

#LUMPE ERRS#

Jim Gentile bounced 
a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single, and 
when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's 
head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.
