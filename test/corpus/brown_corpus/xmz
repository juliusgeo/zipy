as saying- "**h Of course, you have to remember it's a good thing 
for us chartists that there aren't more of us. If you got too 
many people investing by this method, their operations would begin to 
affect stock prices, and thus throw the charts off. The method would 
become self-defeating".   Mr& Alexander H& Wheelan's 
Study Helps in Point and Figure Technique tells the readers- "We 
assure you that the total number of people using this method of 
market analysis is a very small portion of the sum total of those operating 
in the securities and commodities markets".   What with 
traders trading for so many different objectives, and what with there 
being so many unique and individualized market theories and trading 
techniques in use, and more coming into use all the time, it is hard to 
imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough 
"fans" to invalidate itself. Nevertheless, all theories and techniques 
lead but to one of two possible modes of expression, if they lead 
to a market committment at all. In the final analysis, then, the user 
becomes either a bull or a bear in a given instance, notwithstanding 
any amount of forethought and calculation, however elaborate. Thus 
while his theory or technique may not be oversubscribed, it is commonplace 
for bullish and bearish positions to become temporarily over-subscribed. 
Though the methods of deciding may be profound and diverse, the 
possible conclusions remain but two. 

#CHAPTER /6, MORE METHODS# 

_THE HOAXES_ The purpose set forth at the beginning of this book 
was first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge 
of the various types and capabilities of the forecasting methods already 
in use, so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself 
the validity of the rather astonishing empirical correlation that 
is to follow, and to appraise the forecast that its interpretation suggests 
for the future of farm prices over the years immediately ahead.

IN assessing the outlook for interest rates in 1961, the 
question, as always, is the prospect for general business activity. 
By 
and large, what happens to business as a whole will govern the relationship 
between demand and supply conditions in the capital markets and 
will thus determine interest rates. Moreover, the trend of general business 
activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal, monetary, 
and other Federal policies which affect interest rates.

Nineteen-sixty has been a baffling year for analysts of general business 
activity. During much of the year the general level of business 
activity has moved along on a record-high plateau, but there have been 
persistent signs of slack in the economy. The tendency for general 
business activity to soften somewhat is becoming more evident. 
Although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year 
has thus far been quite modest, it is hard to escape the conclusion 
that the softening process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 
and possibly somewhat longer. It is difficult to see any powerful 
sources of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the 
economy a new upward thrust. The rate of plant and equipment spending 
by business and industry now seems to be topping out and facing some 
decline. In earlier business cycles, when this occurred the country usually 
experienced a sharp upturn in residential construction as mortgage 
financing became easier to obtain. At this time, however, there are 
signs that increased availability of mortgage credit will not act with 
the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction. 
These signs are the inventories of unsold houses in some areas of 
the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rates for apartments (7.6% 
in September). On the other hand, in a more favorable vein, general 
business activity should receive some stimulus from rising Federal 
spending, and the reduction in business inventories has probably 
run a good part of its course. The 2% increase in retail sales in October 
to a 4-month high is encouraging in this connection as well 
as the most recent consumer survey by the National Industrial Conference 
Board, which shows a decided pickup in consumer spending plans.

The pattern of general business activity which probably lies 
ahead of us is a further moderate softening through the spring of 1961 
before a new rise in economic activity gets under way. The recovery 
will probably be sparked by a rising rate of housing starts next spring 
in response to more readily available mortgage credit, as well as by 
an expansion of Government spending, well sustained consumer spending, 
and some rebuilding of business inventories. 

#SLIGHT DOWNWARD PRESSURE# 

What does the general business outlook suggest about the trend 
of long-term rates in 1961? It suggests that during the next several 
months, through the spring of 1961, the demand for long-term capital 
funds may be moderately lower and that interest rates may tend to 
move a little lower, especially the rates on Federal, state, and local 
bonds, as well as those on publicly offered corporate bonds. However, 
as witnessed by the large corporate bond calendar at present, as well 
as the record amount of municipal bond issues approved by voters, the 
over-all demands for capital funds seem likely to remain high, so that 
any downward pressure on rates from reduced demand should not be great. 
It seems likely, 
moreover, that with an increase in the rate of 
saving in mortgage lending institutions, interest rates on residential 
mortgages may move somewhat lower through the spring of next year, although 
the increased ease in residential mortgage lending may occur primarily 
in other terms than interest rate, e&g&, easier downpayment 
and amortization terms.   If the trend of general business activity 
follows the pattern suggested here, we are likely to see additional 
steps by the Federal Reserve authorities to ease the availability 
of credit. Certainly a further reduction in the discount rate would 
be a strong possibility, as well as an easier reserve position for the 
banking system. However, the monetary authorities will continue to 
be required to pay attention to the consequences of their actions with 
respect to our international balance of payments position and the outflow 
of gold, as well as with regard to avoiding the creation of excessive 
liquidity in the economy, which would delay the effectiveness of 
monetary policy measures in the next expansion phase of the business cycle. 

#OPEN MARKET POLICY#

One of the most intriguing questions is 
whether the recent departures of the Federal Reserve authorities from 
confining their open market operations to Treasury bills will spread 
into longer-term Government securities in the next few months. To 
the extent that the new Administration has its wishes, the Federal 
Reserve would conduct its open market operations throughout the entire 
maturity range of Government securities and aggressively seek to force 
down long-term interest rates. The principle of "bills only", 
or "bills preferably", seems so strongly accepted by the Federal 
Reserve that it is difficult to envision conditions which would persuade 
the authorities to depart radically from it by extending their open 
market purchases regularly into long-term Government securities. 
However, to the extent that the monetary authorities, in their effort 
to ease credit in the next several months, conduct their open market 
operations in longer-term Government bonds, they will certainly act to 
accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rates to ease as a result 
of market forces.   By the end of the spring of 1961, assuming 
that a general business recovery gets under way, interest rates should 
begin to edge upward again, depending upon the vigor of the recovery 
and the determination with which the monetary authorities move to 
restrain credit availability. My guess would be that interest rates will 
decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half 
of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lost during 
the downturn.   It is pertinent to ask the question: Has the 
long upswing of interest rates during the past 15 years just about 
run its course, and are we now entering a period in which both capital 
market forces and Federal policies will produce a prolonged decline 
of interest rates? My answer is in the negative because I believe 
that total capital demands during the Sixties will continue to press 
against available supplies, and interest rates will generally tend to 
be firm at high levels. 

#FIVE BASIC FORCES#

This view is based upon 
several basic economic forces which I believe will be operating in 
the Sixties, as follows: _(1)_ Recent events in the General 
Assembly of the United Nations confirm that the cold war will remain 
with us, and probably intensify, for the foreseeable future. This makes 
it certain that Federal expenditures for military preparedness and 
foreign economic aid are likely to rise further in the next several 
years. We are just beginning the task of trying to win or maintain the 
friendship of the new African nations against the ruthless competition 
of the Communist bloc. Our efforts to overcome the lead of the 
Russians in space are bound to mean accelerated Federal spending. Moreover, 
it is likely that Federal policies aimed at stimulating a faster 
rate of economic growth of the country, to keep ahead of the Communist 
countries and to demonstrate that our free economic system is better 
than theirs, will lead to rising Federal spending in certain areas 
such as education, housing, medical aid, and the like. There are 
serious dangers involved in this trend toward rising Federal expenditures, 
of which I take a dim view, but it seems very likely to occur. 
_(2)_ During the Sixties we have the prospect of a significant stepping 
up in the rate of household formations, which should contribute 
to a rising volume of consumer expenditures and home building. According 
to the latest 
projections of the Bureau of the Census, the annual 
rate of household formations will increase for the next 20 years. Under 
the most favorable assumptions for increase, the Bureau of the 
Census projects that the annual rate of household formations will rise 
from about 883,000 in the last two years of the Fifties to an annual 
rate of about 1,018,000 in the first five years of the Sixties, and 
to a slightly higher annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the 
decade. During the Seventies the projections show a more pronounced 
rise to an annual rate of 1,338,000 in the second half of that decade. 
Accordingly, the expanding markets for consumer goods and housing 
occasioned by the higher rate of household formation should enhance the 
general economic prospects of the Sixties. However, the impact of 
a rising rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerated. 
The average annual rate of 1,083,000 in the second half of the 
Sixties is still considerably below the annual rate of 1,525,000 in 
the three-year period from April 1947 to March 1950. _(3)_ With 
the expansion of family formation in the Sixties, a continued substantial 
rise in expenditures by state and local government units seems 
to be indicated. This is an area in which there is still a large backlog 
of demand. State and local expenditures (in real terms) increased 
persistently from $26.5-billion in 1949 to $44.3-billion in 1959, and 
it would not be surprising if they showed a comparable increase in this 
decade, which would carry them to the neighborhood of $75-billion 
by 1970. Here would be a powerful force for raising business activity. 
_(4)_ It seems likely that with the three preceding forces at play, 
the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditures 
should continue to move upward from the levels of the Fifties. Spurred 
by keen competition in our industrial system, and still further 
increases in the funds devoted to industrial research, plant and equipment 
expenditures by business and industry should rise during the decade. 
_(5)_ In a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook, 
I suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and housing 
which was dammed-up during the Thirties and World War /2, is finally 
in the process of running dry. There is some clear-cut evidence 
of this. For example, the huge postwar demand on the part of veterans
