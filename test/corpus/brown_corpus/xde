he died. If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position, we had to 
kill 495 before it was ours- and then the last five killed themselves".

Brooding about future wars, the Field Marshal has this 
to say: "The Asian fighting man is at least equally brave [as 
the white], usually more careless of death, less encumbered by mental 
doubts, less troubled by humanitarian sentiment, and not so moved by 
slaughter and mutilation around him. He is, by background and living 
standards, better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly, to demand 
less in the way of subsistence or comfort, and to look after himself 
when thrown on his own resources".

A bunch of young buckaroos from out West, who go by the name 
of Texas Boys Choir, loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded 
in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience.   Actually, the 
program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded, 
and they sang it beautifully. Under the capable direction of the choir's 
founder, Geroge Bragg, the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds 
in an opening group of Renaissance and baroque madrigals and motets, 
excerpts from Pergolesi's "Stabat Mater" and all of the 
Britten "Ceremonial of Carols".   Their singing was well-balanced, 
clear and, within obvious limitations, extremely pleasing. The 
limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices- 
an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity, an occasional 
waver and now and then a bleat.   But Mr& Bragg is 
a remarkably gifted conductor, and the results he has produced with 
his boys are generally superior. Most surprising of all, he has accomplished 
some prodigies in training for the production of words. The Latin, 
for example, was not only clear; it was even beautiful.

Furthermore, there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation 
of the music. Lines came out neatly and in good balance. Tempos were 
lively. The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish.

A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and 
a few other passages enchantingly. Other capable soloists included 
David Clifton, Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson.   The final 
group included folk songs from back home, stomped out, shouted and 
chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume. Boys will be 
boys, and Texans will be Texans. The combination proved quite irresistible 
last night. @

THE Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze, after 
the region of Poland, where it has its headquarters, opened a three-week 
engagement at the City Center last night. A thoroughly ingratiating 
company it is, and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly 
realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all 
evening.   Not that it is all funny, by any means, though some 
of it is definitely so, but simply that the dancers are young and handsome, 
high-spirited and communicative, and the program itself is as vivacious 
as it is varied. There is no use at all in trying to follow 
it dance by dance and title by title, for it has a kind of nonstop format, 
and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses 
for identification.   The material is all basically of folk origin, 
gleaned from every section of Poland. But under the direction of 
Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska, who with her late husband founded the 
organization in 1948, it has all been put into theatrical form, treated 
selectively, choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators, 
and performed altogether professionally. Under the surface of the 
wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training, 
and an equally professional sense of performing. #@#

Since 
the organization was created thirteen years ago, it is obvious that 
this is not the original company; it is more likely the sons and daughters 
of that company. The girls are charming children and the men 
are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters. The stage is constantly 
full of them; indeed, there are never fewer than eight of them on 
stage, and that is only for the more intimate numbers. They can be exuberant 
or sentimental, flirtatious or funny, but the only thing they 
seem unable to be is dull.   To pick out particular numbers is 
something of a problem, but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously 
excellent to be missed. There is for example, a stunning Krakowiak 
that closes the first act; the mazurka choreographed by Witold 
Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera, "Strasny Dwor', 
may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see; there 
is an enchanting polonaise; and the dances and songs from the Tatras 
contain a magnificent dance for the men.   Everywhere there are 
little touches of humor, and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians 
is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments 
with winning warmth.

The {THEATRE-BY-THE-SEA}, Matunuck, presents "King 
of 
Hearts" by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke. Directed by Michael 
Murray; settings by William David Roberts. The cast: @

Producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's 
opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's "King of Hearts".

The dialogue is sharp, witty and candid- typical "don't eat 
the daisies" material- which has stamped the author throughout her 
books and plays, and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience 
liked it.   The story is of a famous strip cartoonist, an 
arty individual, whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts 
a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material.   This is 
when his troubles begin, not to mention a fiedgling artist who he hires, 
and who turns out to have ideas of his own, with particular respect 
to the hero's sweetheart-secretary.   John Heffernan, playing 
Larry Larkin, the cartoonist, carries the show in marvelous fashion. 
His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.

This may be unfortunate, perhaps, from the standpoint 
of David Hedison, Providence's contribution to Hollywood, who is 
appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-Fox. Not that 
Mr& Hedison does not make the most of his role. He does, and more. 
But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist, and it 
has to be that way.   A word should be said for Gary Morgan, a 
Broadway youngsters who, as the adopted son, makes life miserable for 
nearly everybody and Larkin in particular. And for his playmate, Francis 
Coletta of West Warwick, who has a bit part, Billy. 
On the whole, audiences will like this performance. It is a tremendous 
book, lively, constantly moving, and the Matunuck cast does well 
by it.

The {NEWPORT PLAYHOUSE} presents {"EPITAPH FOR 
GEORGE DILLON"} 
by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton, directed by Wallace 
Gray.   The cast: @   The angriest young man in 
Newport last night was at the Playhouse, where "Epitaph for George 
Dillon" opened as the jazz festival closed.   For the hero 
of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered 
by more than the lack of beer during a jam session. He's mad 
at a world he did not make.   Furthermore, he's something of 
a scoundrel, an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips. 
This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards. They not only 
think and feel cliches but live cliches as well.   It is into this 
household, one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls 
out of its people, that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the 
play.   An unsuccessful playwright and actor, he has faith only 
in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists. By the end of the 
third act, the artist is dead but the body lingers on, a shell among other 
shells.   Not altogether a successful play, "Epitaph for 
George Dillon" overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in 
a lesser work might be crippling. It is awfully talky, for instance, 
and not all of the talk is terribly impressive. But it strikes sparks 
on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten. 
There is a fine second act, as an example, one in which Samuel Groom, 
as Dillon, has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage 
after another. This is an exciting young actor to watch. 
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart, 
whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch. 
Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish, almost an 
icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment.   Also fine are 
Sue Lawless, as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female 
spider and just as destructive, Harold Cherry, as her scratchy 
spouse, and Hildy Weissman, as a vegetable in human form.   Wallace 
Gray has directed a difficult play here, usually well, but with 
just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste. 
Still, his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection 
of that pale sustenance, despair.

The {WARWICK MUSICAL THEATER} presents {"Where's 
Charley?"} with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, directed 
by Christopher Hewett, choreography by Peter Conlow, musical direction 
by Samuel Matlowsky. The cast: @   Everybody fell 
in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater, 
and Shelley Berman was to blame.   One of the finest soft shoe 
tunes ever invented, "Once in Love with Amy" is also, of course, 
one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come 
out of American musical comedy in our era. So the audience last 
night was all ears and eyes just after Act /2, got a rousing opening 
chorus, "Where's Charley?", and Berman sifted out all alone 
on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering 
into being.   It is greatly to Berman's credit that he 
made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger. He dropped his earlier and delightful 
hamming, which is about the only way to handle the old war horse 
called "Charley's Aunt", and let himself go with as an appealing 
an "Amy" as anybody could ask.   In brief, Berman played 
himself and not Bolger. The big audience started applauding even 
before he had finished.   The whole production this week is fresh 
and lively. The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous 
gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days. The ballet work 
is on the nose, especially in the opening number by "The New Ashmolean 
Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band", along 
with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later.   Berman, whose 
fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist, 
proved himself very much at home in musical comedy.   Sparrow-size 
Virginia Gibson, with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful 
smile, made a suitably perky Amy, while Melisande Congdon, as the real 
aunt, was positively 
monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner.

All told, "Where's Charley?" ought not to be missed. 
It has a fast pace, excellent music, expert direction, and not only 
a good comedian, but an appealing person in his own right, Mr& 
Berman.

The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C& 
Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of {"FIORELLO!"} 
at Veterans Memorial Auditorium. The book is by Jerome 
Weidman and George Abbott, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon 
Harnick, choreography by Peter Gennaro, scenery, costumes and 
lighting by William and Jean Eckart, musical direction by Jack Elliott, 
and the production was directed by Mr& Abbott. The cast: 
@   This is one of the happier events of the season. 
The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night 
and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce, the politicians 
are in fine voice, the chorines evoke happy memories, and the Little 
Flower rides to break a lance again.   I saw "Fiorello!"
