royal pimp had no key.   She picked her own Middle-Eastern friends 
from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her. Tewfik 
Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of 
Cairo society enjoyed her company.   "So extensive became her 
circle of admirers", Egyptian police said, "that her escapades 
caused distrust".   The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's 
little world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution 
to bring it down. When Farouk was overthrown, police picked up 
his personal pimp, Pulley Bey. They also called upon Diane with 
a request for a look at her passport.   The cagey Pulley Bey, 
who spoke no English, had taken the passport so that Diane 
couldn't 
leave the country without his approval. Officials provided a temporary 
passport, good only for return to the United States.   And 
return to the United States she did, into waiting arms- the unromantic 
ones of the New York District Attorney's office.   Held 
as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey 
Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed 
to the Women's House of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.

It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk 
the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a 
hotel room, with her meals taken at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian 
restaurant.   Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated 
that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.   With 
the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York **h it was 
no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous "Lady Harrington".

Several years ago she married a Houston business man, Robert 
Graham. She later divorced Graham, who is believed to have moved 
to Bolivia.   Houston police got to know Diane two years ago 
when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring. 
Last May, they said, she admitted being a prostitute.   The 
next time the police saw her she was dead.   It was September 
20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles. 
She had had a party with a regular visitor, Dr& William W& 
McClellan.   McClellan, who had once lost his medical license 
temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with her when she died. 
He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had 
happened during that time. When he realized she was dead, he called 
two lawyers and then the police.   When the police arrived, they 
found McClellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.

The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet and a pink 
blanket covered her. Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the 
walls.   An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's 
body. Police theorize that a combination of dope, drink and 
drugs killed her.   "I think that maybe she wanted it this way", 
a vice squad cop said. "A maid told us that she still bragged 
about getting $50 a date. She was on the junk, and they slide fast when 
that happens. At least she never knew what the bottom was 
like". 
I AM a carpet salesman.   I work for one of the biggest chains 
of retail carpet houses in the East. We cater mostly to nice people 
in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy, 
neon-lit, chromium-plated suburban stores.   I am selling the 
stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams- <wall-to-wall 
carpeting>.   There is only one trouble with this big, 
beautiful dream. From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.

People come to me with confidence. They depend on my supposedly 
expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.

But I knowingly abuse their confidence. 
FRANKLIN D& Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs& 
Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited him in Bakersfield, 
California, several months ago as a prospective patient. "Doctor" 
Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes. Then, 
by squeezing her foot three times, he came up- presto- with a 
different diagnosis with each squeeze. She had- he informed her- 
kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female disorder. (He explained 
that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because 
all of the nervous system was connected to it.) He knew just the 
thing for her- a treatment from his "cosmic light ozone generator" 
machine.   As he applied the applicator extending from the 
machine- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed 
on a rectangular base- to the supposedly diseased portions 
of Mrs& Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific 
mumbo-jumbo. Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically 
everything, he assured her. Did she know, he asked, why the 
colors of the tubes were important to people's health? The human 
body- he pointed out, for example- required 33 units of blue light. 
For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue. Continuing 
glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her:   "Don't 
you worry. This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body".

"Cancer"! Mrs& Shaefer practically shrieked. "You 
didn't tell me I had cancer".   "You have it, all right. 
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing 
to worry about. Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with 
97 pounds of cancer in her body".   He urged her to buy one 
of his machines- for $300. When she said that she didn't have the 
money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office 
model until she was ready to buy one. He then sold her minerals to cure 
her kidney ailment, a can of sage "to make her look like a girl again", 
and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.

Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs& Shaefer to buy his machine 
when she visited him the next day. After another treatment with the machine, 
he told her that "her entire body was shot through with tumors 
and cysts". He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would 
take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money 
for buying his machine.   When she submitted to his treatment with 
the capsules, Mrs& Shaefer felt intense pain. Leaving Lee's 
office, Mrs& Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated 
her for burned tissue. For several days, she was ill as a result 
of Lee's treatment.   Mrs& Shaefer never got around to 
joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone 
machines. For Mrs& Shaefer- who had been given a clean bill 
of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee- and her 
friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection 
Bureau. And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the 
evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder 
under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court for convicting 
Franklin D& Lee. The charge: violation of the California Medical 
Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling 
misbranded drugs. The sentence: 360 days' confinement in the 
county jail.   An isolated case of quackery? By no means. Rather, 
it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic 
devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands 
of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them 
away from legitimate, ethical medical treatment of serious diseases. 
The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and 
ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.   With these gadgets- 
impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs, ticks, 
and buzzes- he then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing 
on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of 
our scientific age. He milks the latest scientific advances, translating 
them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his 
fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual 
impotence and cancer.   The gadget faker operates or sells his 
phony machines for $5 to $10,000- 
anything the traffic will bear. He 
may call himself a naprapath, a physiotherapist, an electrotherapist, 
a naturopath, a sanipractor, a medical cultist, a masseur, a "doctor"- 
or what have you. Not only do these quacks assume impressive 
titles, but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific 
or impressive foundations- 
foundations which often have little 
more than a letterhead existence.   The medical device pirate 
of today, of course, is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor 
of yesteryear- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and 
other patent medicines. His plunder is therefore far higher- running 
into hundreds of millions.   According to the Food and Drug 
Administration (~FDA), "Doctor" Ghadiali, Dr& Albert 
Abrams and his clique, and Dr& Wilhelm Reich- to name three notorious 
device quacks- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000, 
5000, and 2000 fake health machines.   Authorities believe 
that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are 
still in business. Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims 
in Cleveland. Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid $1020 to 
a masseur, and Mr& A&, a laborer, paid $4200 to a chiropractor for 
treatment with two fake health machines- the "radioclast" and 
the "diagnometer". Multiply these figures by the millions of people 
known to be conned by medical pirates annually. You will come up 
with a frightening total.   That's why the ~FDA, the American 
Medical Association (~AMA), and the National Better Business 
Bureau (~BBB) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery 
to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical 
charlatans annually.   The Postmaster General recently reported 
that mail order frauds- among which fake therapeutic devices 
figure prominently- are at the highest level in history. Similarly, 
the American Cancer Society (~ACS), the Arthritis and Rheumatism 
Foundation, and the ~BBB have each stated lately that medical 
quackery is at a new high. For example, the ~BBB has reported 
it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 
10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.   Authorities 
hesitate to quote exact figures, however, believing that any 
sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation- turned up by 
their inevitably limited policing- of the real loot of the medical 
racketeer. In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates of phony 
device quackery are conservative.   The economic toll that 
the device quack extracts is important, of course. But it is our health- 
more precious than all the money in the world- that these modern 
witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away. 
By preying on the sick, by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate, 
by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical 
ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.   Typically, 
Sarah Gross and Mr& ~A both lost more than their money 
as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks. Sarah 
Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment 
by the masseur were not helping her. As a result, she consulted medical 
authorities and learned that the devices her quack "doctor" was 
using were phony. She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be 
institutionalized.

Mr& A&, her fellow townsman, also experienced 
a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been 
bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been 
treating his wife- a woman suffering from an incurable disease, multiple 
sclerosis- and himself. Mr& ~A has recovered, but he is, 
justifiably, a bitter man. "That's a lot of hard-earned money to 
lose", he says today. "Neither me nor my wife were helped by that 
chiropractor's treatments".   And there was the case of Tom 
Hepker, a machinist, who was referred by a friend to a health machine 
quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what 
Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine. After 
his pains got worse, Tom decided to see a real doctor, from whom he 
learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung. Yes, Tom caught 
it in time to stay alive. But he's a welfare case now- a human wreck-
