is that under American leadership the general world situation has 
become bad. To "Monty", the American people, who in two previous 
world wars were very reluctant to join the fight, "now look like the 
nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War". ## 
{AS} 
faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States 
must be relied upon to lead. The path to leadership is made clear. 
Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own 
house in order. Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and 
sensible advice to the whole group, a person in whom all the member nations 
will have absolute confidence. This leader must be a man who lives 
above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of 
the United States, namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany, 
that the East German government does not exist, that events in 
Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired, that the true government 
of China is in Formosa, that Mao was the evil influence behind 
Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960, and that 
either China or Russia wants or expects war.   Such a leader 
must strengthen ~NATO politically, and establish that true unity 
about which it has always talked. After drastically overhauling ~NATO, 
Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that 
tear apart the East and West. Major to this effort is to get all 
world powers to withdraw to their own territories, say by 1970. "The 
West should make the central proposal; but the East would have 
to show sincerity in carrying it out".   "But where is the 
leader who will handle all these things for us"? Montgomery knew 
all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy. The man whom he 
would select as our leader for this great task is de Gaulle. He alone 
has the wisdom, the conviction, the tenacity, and the courage to reach 
a decision. But de Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's 
lost soul.   Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous 
path to leadership. The leader Montgomery envisages will need 
to discipline himself, lead a carefully regulated and orderly life, 
allow time for quiet thought and reflection, adapt decisions and plans 
to changing situations, be ruthless, particularly with inefficiency, 
and be honest and morally proper. All in all, Montgomery calls for a 
leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him. 
##

{IN LOOKING} as far back as Moses, thence to Cromwell, 
Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, and Nehru, Montgomery attempts 
to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men. He believes that 
greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented 
by Churchill, who would very possibly have gone down in history 
as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war.

However, Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory 
and practice. Most of what is said about his great men of history 
has already been said, and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary 
scene. Like Eisenhower, he holds the militarist's suspicion 
of politicians. However, at the same time Montgomery selects as 
his hero de Gaulle, who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions. 
"Monty" shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement 
and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support. 
For the most part, his writing rambles and jogs, preventing easy access 
by the reader to his true thoughts.   Nevertheless, Montgomery 
has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world. 
It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership. 
And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form 
can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the 
current shape of events.

{IT IS} no common thing for a listener (critical or otherwise) 
to hear a singer "live" for the first time only after he 
has died. But then, Mario Lanza was no common singer, and his whole 
career, public and non-public, was studded with the kind of unconventional 
happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first "recital" 
only when he has ceased to be a living voice. It is a kind 
of justice, too, that it should originate in London's Royal Albert 
Hall, where, traditionally, the loudest, if not the greatest, performers 
have entertained the thousands it will accommodate (~RCA Victor 
~LM 2454, $4.98).   To be sure, Lanza made numerous concert 
tours, here and abroad, but these did not take him to New York 
where the carping critic might lurk.

The reading public, the theatergoing public, the skindiving 
public, the 
horse-playing public- all these and others fill substantial roles 
in U&S& life, but none is so varied, vast and vigilant as the eating 
public. The Department of Agriculture averaged out U&S& 
food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs& per person, which, allowing 
for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry 
every night, means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow 
down 8 lbs& or more a day. That mother hen of the weight-height 
tables, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co&, clucks that 48 million 
Americans are overweight.   Through previous centuries, eating 
changed by nearly imperceptible degrees, and mostly toward just 
getting enough. Now big forces buffet food. For the first time in history, 
the U&S& has produced a society in which less than one-tenth 
of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most 
embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million 
tons of surplus farm produce. In this same society, the plain citizen 
can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than 
he can consume. Refrigeration, automated processing and packaging 
conspire to defy season and banish spoilage. And in the wake of the new 
affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American 
interest in how what people eat affects their health. To eat is human, 
the nation is learning to think, to survive divine. 

#FADS, FACTS 
**H#

Not all the concern for health is well directed. From the fusty 
panaceas of spinach, eggs and prunes, the U&S& has progressed 
to curds, concentrates and capsules. Each year, reports the American 
Medical Association, ten million Americans spend $900 million on 
vitamins, tonics and other food supplements. At juice bars in Los 
Angeles' 35 "health" stores, a new sensation is a pink, high-protein 
cocktail, concocted of dried eggs, powdered milk and cherry-flavored 
No-Cal, which sells for 59@ per 8-oz& glass. Grocery stores 
sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all.

But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet 
and health, and a big group of U&S& scientists wants to supply 
them. The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University 
of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys, 57, inventor of the wartime 
~K (for Keys) ration and author of last year's bestselling 
<Eat Well and Stay Well>. From his birch-paneled office in the 
Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene, under the university's football 
stadium in Minneapolis ("We get a rumble on every touchdown"), 
blocky, grey-haired Dr& Keys directs an ambitious, $200,000-a-year 
experiment on diet, which spans three continents and seven nations 
and is still growing. Pursuing it, he has logged 500,000 miles, suffered 
indescribable digestive indignities, and meticulously collected 
physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals, 
from Bantu tribesmen to Italian <contadini>. He has measured 
the skinfolds (the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades) of Neapolitan 
firemen, studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters, analyzed 
the "mealie-meal" eaten by Capetown coloreds, and experimented 
on Minneapolis businessmen. #**H AND FATS.#

Keys's findings, 
though far from complete, are likely to smash many an eating cliche. 
Vitamins, eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on (though 
mothers' milk is still the ticket). Readings of the number of milligrams 
of cholesterol in the blood, which seem to have value in predicting 
heart attacks, are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram, 
which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack. Already 
many an American knows his count, and rejoices or worries depending 
on whether it is nearer 180 (safe) or 250 (dangerous).   Out 
of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far:   @ Americans 
eat too much. The typical U&S& daily menu, says Dr& 
Keys, contains 3,000 calories, should contain 2,300. And extra weight 
increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, artery disease and heart attack.

@ Americans eat too much fat. With meat, milk, butter 
and ice cream, the calorie-heavy U&S& diet is 40% fat, and most 
of that is saturated fat- the insidious kind, says Dr& Keys, 
that increases blood cholesterol, damages arteries, and leads to coronary 
disease. 

#OBESITY: A MALNUTRITION.#

Throughout much of the 
world, food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population 
has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life. 
The deficiency diseases- scurvy, tropical sprue, pellagra- run 
rampant. In West Africa, for example, where meat is a luxury and babies 
must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals, 
a childhood menace is <kwashiorkor,> or "red Johnny", a growth-stunting 
protein deficiency (signs: reddish hair, bloated belly) 
that kills more than half its victims, leaves the rest prey for parasites 
and lingering tropical disease.   In the well-fed U&S&, 
deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years. Today, 
as Harrison's <Principles of Internal Medicine,> a standard 
internist's text, puts it, "The most common form of malnutrition 
is caloric excess or obesity".   Puritan New England regarded 
obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance, and thus a sin. Says 
Keys: "Maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral, 
the fat man would start to think". Morals aside, the fat man 
has plenty to worry about- over and above the fact that no one any 
longer loves him. The simple mechanical strain of overweight, says New 
York's Dr& Norman Jolliffe, can overburden and damage the 
heart "for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac 
body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it 
was built". The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to 
pay higher premiums. He has- for unclear reasons- a 25% higher 
death rate from cancer. He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes. He 
may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable, because excess 
body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement.

Physiologically, people overeat because what Dr& Jolliffe 
calls the "appestat" is set too high. The appestat, which adjusts 
the appetite to keep weight constant, is located, says Jolliffe, 
in the hypothalamus- near the body's temperature, sleep and water-balance 
controls. Physical exercise raises the appestat. So does cold 
weather. In moderate doses, alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances 
appetite (the original reason for the cocktail); but because liquor 
has a high caloric value- 100 calories per oz&- the heavy 
drinker is seldom hungry. In rare cases, diseases such as encephalitis 
or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently, destroying 
nearly all sense of satiety. 

#FOOD FOR FRUSTRATION.#

Far more frequently, 
overeating 
is the result of a psychological compulsion. It 
may be fostered by frustration, depression, insecurity- or, in children, 
simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging. Some
