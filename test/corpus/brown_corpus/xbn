also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly 
to Communist China. The question arose as to whether a frank discussion 
of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent. Moreover, 
Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle 
to the executive organs of all international bodies, including 
the U& N& Secretariat and the International Control Commission 
for Laos. Mr& Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand 
would make international agreements, or even negotiations, impossible.

Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability 
of an early summit meeting. Initially the White House reaction 
was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict 
in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting. At the same time, 
there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader, 
as a result of those episodes, come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion 
about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist 
pressure.   In Cuba, the U& S& had blundered badly and 
created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even 
on its own doorstep. In Laos, the picture was almost equally bad. 
U& S& willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier 
Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be "neutralized" 
on Soviet terms. Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention 
in Laos- despite warnings that they might do so- allowed 
Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic 
moves that greatly strengthened the pro-Communist forces. As a result, 
the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva 
negotiations on Laos, and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast 
Asia are under increased pressure.   In the light of those 
events, there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev 
might overreach himself. Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow 
that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive. He has indicated 
that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out. The 
President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn 
Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such 
as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning 
back.   It was in the midst of such White House deliberations 
that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the 
U& S& Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in 
the near future. Mr& Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer 
by May 20 after consultation with the Allies. The response from 
London, Paris and Bonn was favorable. Firm arrangements for the meeting 
in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and 
Washington last week. Apparently at the insistence of the U& S&, 
the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow 
last Friday emphasized the "informal" nature of the meeting. The 
Washington announcement said:   @ "The President and Chairman 
Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose 
of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems 
that involve the interest of many other countries. The meeting 
will, however, afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first 
personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the 
major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries".

#THE OUTLOOK#

The Vienna meeting will bring together a 
seasoned, 
67-year-old veteran of the cold war who, in Mr& Kennedy's 
own words, is "shrewd, tough, vigorous, well-informed and confident", 
and a 44-year-old President (his birthday is May 29) with a 
demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international 
diplomacy. The announcement last week of the forthcoming 
encounter produced strong reactions in the U& S& of both approval 
and disapproval.   The approval did not arise from an expectation 
of far-reaching agreements at Vienna. The inclination was to accept 
the statement that there would be no formal negotiations. But those 
who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between 
the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary. 
Mr& Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about 
his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men. The feeling was 
that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the 
President and that plain talk by Mr& Kennedy would give him pause.

Apart from the personal equation, another reason advanced 
in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U&S& 
appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit. Premier Khrushchev 
has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got 
his summit meeting anyway. This time the initiative came, in part 
at least, from Washington. 

#OTHER ALLIES CONSULTED#

There was also 
the fact that by the time he meets Mr& Khrushchev, the President 
will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied 
leaders. Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader 
of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.   Finally, 
there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's 
making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test 
accord. There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings 
throughout the world. If tests are to be resumed, the argument went, 
it is vital that the U& S& make plain that the onus belongs to 
the Soviet Union.   Disapproval of the meeting was based largely 
on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse. After Cuba 
and Laos, it was argued, Mr& Khrushchev will interpret the President's 
consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness- 
perhaps even panic- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage 
he now believes he holds. Moreover, the President is meeting the 
Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided 
on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments. The 
question was raised, for example, as to what attitude the President 
would take if Mr& Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending 
from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.

THERE ARE, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms of 
adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory. 
Mollusks are a case in point. The shell, which served the strain 
so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended 
to cancel out the possibility of future development. Though this may 
or may not be good biology, it does aptly illustrate the strength and 
the weakness of American Catholic higher education.   There can 
be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field 
of higher education is most impressive: our European brethren never 
cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities. 
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades, 
rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that. 
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement 
stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which 
brought the parochial school system into existence.   There 
is, however, one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture. 
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect, 
we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school 
to university. But the simple truth is that higher education has 
never really been an official American Catholic project; certainly 
not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school 
system has been a matter of official policy.   Official encouragement 
is one thing, but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan 
and parochial funds. American Catholics have responded generously 
to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to 
create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar 
fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning. They 
have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly 
ever been made. Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this 
as their direct responsibility.   All of this may be understandable 
enough: it is, however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan 
authorities could have acted otherwise. Yet for better or for worse, 
the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do 
<not> owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to 
the initiative, resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious 
communities. Community <esprit de corps> has been the protective 
shell which has made the achievement possible.   To understand 
the past history- and the future potential- of American Catholic 
higher education, it is necessary to appreciate the special character 
of the <esprit d' corps> of the religious community. It is something 
more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and 
detachment. A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves 
a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found 
elsewhere. The fact that the group orientation and group identification 
are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs 
of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension. 
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship, 
the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting 
edge of sacrifice and hardship.   American Catholic colleges 
and universities are, in a very real sense, the product of "private 
enterprise"- the "private enterprise" of religious communities. 
Had it not been for such private enterprise, diocesan authorities 
might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized 
by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious 
as paid employees. There is however no point in speculating about such 
a possibility: the fact of the matter is that our institutions of 
higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which 
produces the "family business". This "family-community" spirit 
is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement. ## 

IT IS this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American 
Catholic higher education, in particular the wasteful duplication 
apparent in some areas. I think for example of three women's colleges 
with pitifully small enrollments, clustered within a few miles of 
a major Catholic university, which is also co-educational. This is not 
an isolated example; this aspect of the total picture has been commented 
upon often enough. It would seem to represent <esprit de corps> 
run riot.   Apart, however, from the question of wasteful duplication, 
there is another aspect of the "family business" spirit 
in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny. 
For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have 
been adequately met by collegiate institutions, which in temper and tone 
closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools, it would 
seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles 
the university in its "pursuit of excellence". At the earlier 
"pre-academic excellence" stage of Catholic education, the operation 
could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis. But with today's 
demand for professional qualifications and specialized training, 
the need for "outsiders" become more pressing. ##

THE PROBLEM 
is not merely that more "outside teachers" are needed but 
that a different brand is called for. Commenting on the earlier stage, 
the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University 
Professors 
(in a recent report on the question of faculty participation 
in administrative decision-making) noted that the term "teacher-employee" 
(as opposed to, e&g&, "maintenance employee") was 
a not inapt description. Today however, the "outsider" is likely 
to have professional qualifications of the highest order (otherwise 
the college would not be interested in hiring him) and to be acclimatized 
to the democratic processes of the secular or state university. And 
while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene, the scholar 
will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second 
class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank
