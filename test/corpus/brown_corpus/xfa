precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed 
in a matter of three or four days. Then you can do the finishing 
touches at your leisure. 

#A WARNING#

Due to the fact that building 
codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country, the first 
thing to do is to find out what, if any, they are. Close to a large 
city they might even specify the size of the nails used; in a remote 
section there might be no restrictions at all. This can usually 
be found out at the nearest town hall. At the same time check the electrical, 
plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as well as possible zoning 
regulations. Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available 
or not, check the local customs in the use of bottled or ~L-P 
gas (we give you alternatives later on). Be sure that this information 
is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion. If there 
are any major restrictions, they usually can be obtained in printed 
form. Where a building permit is required, find out what you must 
present when applying for one. In many cases, you must file a complete 
set of plans with the local building inspector. These will be available 
at cost from our Plans Department. 

#THE SITE#

Some general 
things to look for in a site, if you haven't already bought one, are 
accessibility, water drainage, and orientation. How are the roads, 
and how will they stand up? Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property; 
swampy areas or intermittent springs? A visit in the early 
spring after a thaw will be very informative. Note where the sun rises 
and sets, and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms 
come from. Will the view be something you can live with? Don't 
worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain; we will take up alternative 
foundations later on. 

#THE MATERIALS#

With this first issue 
we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic (~A 
version) and the expandable (~B version). This will be <for the 
shell of the house only> (roof, walls, and floor), and does not include 
the carport or balcony. This will permit you to get a <rough> 
estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost. Bear in mind 
that this does <not> include interior panels for partitions, fancy 
flooring, appliances and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing, 
all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.   The 
wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard **f and **f of 
a good grade, free from structural faults. They should be as straight 
as possible, as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when 
the walls are erected. The outside surface of the solid units shall 
be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood, plastic coated 
panel board, high density particle board, asbestos-cement board, or 
any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building 
supply dealer. The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof, and 
the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired. All panel 
board comes in standard **f foot size. It is recommended that panels 
be both glued as well as nailed to the frame. The fixed window panels 
with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass 
set in a mastic glazing compound. The louvers are constructed as 
shown in the detail, with a drop door for ventilation. There are standard 
sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels 
requiring them. The door panels are designed to accommodate standard 
doors which should be of exterior grade. The filler panels for the gable 
ends are cut from full **f sheets as shown, leaving no wastage. The 
battens covering the joints are of **f stock and are applied after 
the walls are erected. All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is 
highly recommended. Note: If 1/2-inch panel board is used inside 
and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other, and 1/8-inch glass 
is used, stock lumber in **f, **f, and **f can be used in making the 
glass panels. Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special 
size lumber for the glass trim. In any case, there is no special milling 
or rabbeting required for the panels.

With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting 
tools, fixtures, and attachments available, the drill press has become 
a basic home workshop tool. The drill press consists of a vertical 
shaft (spindle) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a 
drill chuck, a tubular housing (quill) in which the spindle is mounted, 
a head in which the quill is mounted, a feed lever which moves the 
quill up or down, a power source, and a movable table upon which the work 
is placed. There is often a means of locking the quill and, on larger 
presses, the table can be tilted.   The size of the press is 
usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity (the maximum diameter tool 
shank it will hold) or distance between the spindle center and the 
column. A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center 
of a 22 inch board or circle.   A new radial drill press with 
a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done 
at any angle. The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on 
the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work. 

#SET-UP AND MAINTENANCE#

The drill press should be leveled and, depending 
on whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely to a 
sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws. 
This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.   A coat 
of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the 
polished surface of the table; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth 
will discourage rusting of the column and quill. Presses not fitted 
with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in 
the lubrication holes in the quill. The rest of the press should be kept 
clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.   Be careful to 
keep the drive belt free of oil and grease. Belt tension is adjusted 
by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount. Keep 
the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by 
hand; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle 
bearings. Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises 
the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds 
the quill in the raised position. The return spring tension may be 
adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing 
with a pair of pliers (to prevent the spring from unwinding when it 
is released), loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing 
until the desired tension is achieved. Turning the housing clockwise 
will reduce tension, counter-clockwise will increase it. 

#DON'T 
LOSE THE CHUCK KEY#

Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide 
a socket for the chuck key; otherwise, you'll have to spend 
a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the 
press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the 
bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not 
in use. 

#FEEDS AND SPEEDS#

Drill speeds are important if you want 
a good job. Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed, 
depending on the material worked. On most drill presses, it is impossible 
to get the exact speed, but you can come close by adjusting the 
drive belt on the step-cone pulleys. You will find a chart giving the 
various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere 
in the instruction booklet that came with the tool. See the table 
on page 34 for exact recommended speeds. Generally, the larger the 
tool and the harder the material, the slower the speed.   Feed pressure 
is also of major importance. Too much pressure will force the 
tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed 
or broken tools. Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other hard 
material, causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting 
edge. The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed 
with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even 
rate. 

#COMMON DRILLING TOOLS#

There are numerous types and styles 
of tools to drill holes. The most common are the twist drill, the 
solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the double spur 
bit, and the power wood bit. All will do a good job if sharp, but the 
twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others, since they 
do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual 
boring starts.   The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting 
large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by 
reversing the cutter blade. Since fly cutters are one sided and not 
balanced, they should be used at the slowest speed available, and fed 
very slowly to avoid binding. Fly cutters can fool you into putting 
your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to avoid nicked fingers, 
keep your hands well out of the way. 

#SIMPLE HOLE DRILLING OPERATIONS# 

When drilling all the way through a workpiece, always place a 
piece of scrap wood underneath. This will not only protect the work 
table, but also assure a clean breakthrough. Another method of assuring 
a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through, 
then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn the piece over, 
and finish from the other side. In soft woods with pronounced grain, 
there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying 
hardness of the wood. In this case, drilling a small pilot hole or 
clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.   When a hole 
is to be bored to a predetermined depth, mark the depth on the side 
of the stock, then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark. 
The depth gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored to 
exact and identical depth.

The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts 
are of unusual interest in many respects. For their length, their 
types of construction, their picturesque settings, and their literary 
associations, they should be known and remembered. In this sequence 
I shall write about them in the order of their erection.   The 
first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part,- and perhaps 
the most interesting one, connected Newbury (now Newburyport) with 
Salisbury Point. Its building was first proposed in 1791, when a 
group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned the General Court 
for an act of incorporation. This document began: _"NO& 
1 NEWBURY PORT, MAY 30TH, 1791_   "Whereas, a Bridge over 
Merrimack River, from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf, 
Esquire, in Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury, 
would be of very extensive utility, by affording a safe Conveyance 
to Carriages, Teams 
and Travellers at all seasons of the year, 
and at all Times of Tide.   "We, the Subscribers, do agree, 
that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to 
this, or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to the Hon'ble 
General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, praying 
for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such 
Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge, and a Right to demand 
a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms,
