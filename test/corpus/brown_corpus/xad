The scholarship plan 
would 
provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal 
to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students. The 
schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need, 
of up to $2,000 a year per student.   In addition, the government 
would pay a $1,000 "cost of education" grant to the schools for 
each $1,500 in scholarship grants. Officials estimated the combined 
programs would cost 
5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 
millions by 1966.   The President recommended federal "matching 
grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing 
new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing 
ones. 

#MORE FOR NURSING HOMES#

In the area of "community health 
services", the President called for doubling the present 10 million 
dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction. He asked 
for another 10 million dollar "initial" appropriation for "stimulatory 
grants" to states to improve nursing homes.   He further 
proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.

In the child health field, the President said he will recommend 
later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau. 
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national 
child health institute. 

#ASKS RESEARCH FUNDS#

The President said 
he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation. 
He did not say by how much.   For medical research 
he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, 
in matching grants for building research facilities. The President 
said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540 
million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research 
in medicine.   The President said his proposals combine the "indispensable 
elements in a sound health program- people, knowledge, 
services, facilities, and the means to pay for them". 

#REACTION 
AS EXPECTED#

Congressional reaction to the message was along expected 
lines. Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under 
the social security system criticized the President's plan. Those 
who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.   Senate 
Republican Leader Dirksen [Ill&] and House Republican Leader 
Charles Halleck [Ind&] said the message did not persuade them 
to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance. Halleck 
said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair 
trial first.   House Speaker Sam Rayburn [D&, Tex&] 
called the Kennedy program "a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction 
on its fate in the House. 
_WASHINGTON, FEB& 9_- Acting hastily under White House pressure, 
the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C& Weaver as the nation's 
federal housing chief.   Only 11 senators were on the floor 
and there was no record vote. A number of scattered "ayes" and 
"noes" was heard.   Customary Senate rules were ignored in 
order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing 
and home finance agency.   In the last eight years, all 
Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been 
denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least 
a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor. 

#ENFORCE BY DEMAND# 

The rule was enforced by demand of Sen& Wayne Morse [D&, 
Ore&] in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet 
selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961. 
_OSLO_ The most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been 
the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual 
understanding than in past meetings.   This has been a working 
session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed 
along its route step by step and without dramatic changes. In Oslo, 
the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine 
attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.

This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable 
where relations are concerned between the "colonialist" powers 
and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems. 
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated 
by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other 
allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances 
that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicious by 
its absence. 

#EXPLOSION AVOIDED#

In the case of Portugal, which 
a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the ~NATO Council 
should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been 
a noticeable relaxation of tension. The general, remarkably courteous, 
explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been 
no explosion in the council. There should even be no more bitter surprises 
in the ~UN General Assembly as to ~NATO members' votes, 
since a new ad hoc ~NATO committee has been set up so that 
in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.

Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt 
to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the ~NATO 
locomotive. Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against 
atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance, 
is today closer to the ~NATO line.   On the negative 
side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the 
United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for. 
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's 
speeches as "inconclusive". But he hastened to add that, 
if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr& Rusk's 
analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the 
West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly 
fixed its policy. 

#EXPLORATORY MOOD#

A certain vagueness may also 
be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council 
meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents 
accredited.   The impression has nevertheless been 
given during these three days, despite Mr& Rusk's personal popularity, 
that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat 
tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn 
than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application 
to individual danger spots.   The Secretary of State 
himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of 
events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the 
new administration in the past four months.   But where the core 
of ~NATO is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only 
reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance, 
"cornerstone" of its foreign policy, but has announced that five 
nuclear submarines will eventually be at ~NATO's disposal in 
European waters.   The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated 
a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will 
not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken 
up by the council as a whole. 

#CONFLICT SURVEYED#

The secretary's 
greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of ~NATO realization 
that East-West friction, wherever it take place around the 
globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different 
societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical 
distance or lack of apparent connection.   The annual spring 
meeting has given an impetus in three main directions: more, deeper, 
and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (when 
ratified) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries, 
and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the 
maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.   This increase in the 
"threshold", as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will 
prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months 
to come. Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid 
down, but never completely fulfilled. 
_WASHINGTON_ The Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a 
Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy 
erupts for the first time.   There is little optimism here 
that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table 
than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.   The 
United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly 
interested in setting up an international inspection system which will 
prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring 
Thailand and South Viet Nam.   They count on the aid 
of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve 
this.   The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet 
would not become Communist dominated. But it is apparent that no acceptable 
formula has been found to prevent such a possibility. 

#POLICIES MODIFIED#

The inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire 
in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the 
cease-fire by the international control commission before participating 
in the Geneva conference.   This is another of the modifications 
of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled 
to make. It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to 
basic errors made in the previous administration.   Its spokesmen 
insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in 
military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.   But 
with the months moving on- and the immediate confrontations with the 
Communists showing no gain for the free world- the question arises:

How effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy 
decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?   Former 
Vice-President Richard M& Nixon in Detroit called for a 
firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union. He was critical 
of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory. 
 
#~GOP RESTRAINED#

It does not take a Gallup poll to 
find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the 
situation as Republicans see it. They can hardly restrain themselves 
from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been 
in power, would have made "amateurish and monumental blunders" in 
Cuba.   One Republican senator told this correspondent that he 
was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration
