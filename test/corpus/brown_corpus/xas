of the Wackers' new baby. Fur goodness sake!} @ ##

Scarsdale, N&Y&.   Mrs& Kelsey is the former {Miss

A cheery smile, a compassionate interest in others and a practical 
down-to-earth approach.   Those qualities make {Esther Marr} 
a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social 
Center at 1200 Larimer st&.   The pert, gray-haired woman 
who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo, N&Y&, is 
a "civilian" with the Army.   Her position covers a number 
of daily tasks common to any social director. The job also covers a 
number of other items.   "Mom" Marr, as the more than 80 men 
at the center call her, 
is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between 
alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.

Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing letters 
there are to be written (and during May, which is National Salvation 
Army Week, there are plenty), schedules to be made or problems 
to be solved, Mrs& Marr's office is always open and the welcome 
mat is out.   {MRS& MARR} is the first contact a Skid 
Row 
figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.

She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and 
the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and 
explains procedures.   "Usually at this point a man is withdrawn 
from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle 
with his fellow men", Mrs& Marr explained.   The Denverite 
has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities 
of the center.   "And I bum tickets to everything I can", 
she said. "I've become the greatest beggar in the world".

{IN ADDITION} 
to the tickets to the movies, sporting events 
and concerts, Mrs& Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics 
require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system.

Mrs& Marr also has a number of parolees to "mother", watching 
to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn 
to readjust to society.

By mid-June, millions of Americans will take to the road on 
vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely 
land.   In another four weeks, with schools closed across the 
nation, the great all-American summer safari will be under way. By 
July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers all over the nation will, 
by 6 p&m&, be switching on that bleak- to motorists- sign, "No 
Vacancy".   No matter how many Americans go abroad in 
summer, probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car, throw 
suitcases, kids and comic books in the back seat, and head for home. And 
where is "home", that magic place of the heart?   Ah, 
that is simple. Home is where a man was born, reared, went to school 
and, most particularly, where grandma is. That is where we turn in the 
good old summertime.   The land lies ready for the coming onslaught. 
My husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just finished 
a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson, Ariz&, to New 
York City:
