the utilization of extremely low incident light levels. The effect 
of device and quantum noise, associated with such low input levels, 
will be described.   After these theoretical considerations, constructional 
details of a fiber-coupled, double-stage X-ray image 
intensifier will be discussed. Measured performance characteristics 
for this experimental tube will be listed.   The conclusion shall 
be reached that fiber-coupled, double-stage tubes represent a sensible 
and practical approach to high-gain image intensification. 

#BASIC 
DESIGN OF A FIBER-COUPLED, DOUBLE-STAGE IMAGE INTENSIFIER#

The tube 
design which forms the basis of the theoretical discussion shall 
be described now. The electron optical system (see fig& 14-1) is 
based in principle on the focusing action of concentric spherical cathode 
and anode surfaces. The inner [anode] sphere is pierced, elongated 
into a cup, and terminated by the phosphor screen. The photoelectrons 
emitted from a circular segment of the cathode sphere are focused 
by the positive lens action of the two concentric spheres, pass through 
the [negative] lens formed by the anode aperture, and impinge 
upon the cathodoluminescent viewing screen. The cylindrical focusing 
electrode permits adjustment of the positive lens part by varying the 
focusing potential. The anode potential codetermines the gain, ~<G>, 
and magnification, ~<M>, of the stage.   Both the photocathode 
and the image plane of such an electrode configuration are curved 
concave as seen from the anode aperture. The field-flattening property 
of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilized to alleviate the 
peripheral resolution losses resulting with a flat phosphor-screen or 
coupling member. For the same reason, the output fiber plate is planoconcave, 
its exposed flat side permitting contact photography if a permanent 
record is desired. As it will be shown later, the field-flattening 
properties of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed 
the main advantage of such a design.   The second photocathode 
and both phosphor surfaces are deposited on the fiber plate substrates. 
The photocathode sensitivities ~<S>, phosphor efficiencies 
~<P>, and anode potentials ~<V> of the individual stages shall 
be distinguished by means of subscripts /1, and /2, in the text, 
where required. Both stages are assumed to have unity magnification. 

#THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF FLUX GAIN#

_FLUX GAIN OF A SINGLE 
STAGE_ The luminous gain of a single stage with **f (flux gain) is, 
to a first approximation, given by the product of the photocathode 
sensitivity ~<S> (amp/lumen), the anode potential ~<V> (volts), 
and the phosphor conversion efficiency ~<P> (lumen-watt). In 
general, ~<P> is a function of ~<V> and the current density, 
but it shall here be assumed as a constant.   The luminous 
efficiency **f of a photocathode depends on the maximum radiant 
sensitivity **f and on the spectral distribution of the incident light 
**f by the relation: **f where **f **h normalized radiant photocathode 
sensitivity. **f **h standard visibility function. The luminous flux 
gain of a single stage is given by: **f If the input light distribution 
falls beyond the visible range, **f as expected, since **f. Such 
cases are not considered here. _EFFICIENCY OF FIBER COUPLERS_ 
The efficiency of fiber optics plates depends on four factors: _(A)_ 
numerical aperture (N&A&). _(B)_ end (Fresnel reflection) 
losses (~<R>). 
_(C)_ internal losses (I&L&). _(D)_ 
packing efficiency (F&R&). The numerical aperture of the fibers 
is given by: **f where **f.   The angle **f is measured in 
the medium of index **f. Settled phosphors, as generally used in image 
intensifiers, have low optical contact with the substrate surface, 
hence **f shall be assumed. The numerical aperture should be in general 
close to unity. This condition can be satisfied, e&g&, with **f 
and **f or equivalent glass combinations.   A sufficiently good 
approximation for determining the end reflection losses ~<R> 
can be 
obtained from the angle independent Fresnel formula: **f For phosphor 
to fiber and fiber to air surfaces, and assuming **f, we obtain 
**f percent. This value may be reduced to 4.6 percent by means of a (very 
thin) glass layer of index 1.5. Hence, the **f factor for the output 
fiber coupler is **f.   As the index of refraction of photosensitive 
surfaces of the ~SbCs-type lies around 2, the Fresnel losses 
at the fiber-photocathode interface are about 0.5 percent and the 
**f factor for the interstage coupler is 0.95. It might be anticipated 
that multiple coatings will reduce end reflection losses even further.

The internal losses are due to absorption and the small but 
finite losses suffered in the numerous internal reflections due to 
deviations from the prescribed, cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute 
imperfections of the core-jacket interface. These losses depend 
on fiber diameter and length, absorption coefficient, the mean value of 
the loss per internal reflection and last but not least, on the angular 
distribution of the incident light. Explicit expressions (integral 
averages) are given in the literature. Lacking reliable data for some 
of the variables, we are relying on experimental data of about 20 percent 
internal losses for 1/4-inch long, small (5-10~|m) diameter 
fibers. This relatively high value is probably due to the small fiber 
diameters increasing the number of internal reflections. Since we are 
considering here relatively small diameter (1-1.5 inches) fiber plates, 
their average thickness can be kept below 1/4 inch and their internal 
losses may be assumed as 15 percent (per plate).   The packing 
efficiency, F&R&, of fiber plates did not receive much attention 
in the literature, probably as it is high for the larger fibers generally 
used, until rather recently. For circular fibers in a closely 
packed hexagonal array, the packing efficiency is given by: **f where 
**f, and 0.906 is the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the 
circumscribed hexagon. For the small diameter fibers now technically 
feasible and required for about 100 **f resolution, **f. The cladding 
thickness is about 0.5~|m, hence, **f and **f.   Thus, 
the efficiency ~|t couplers is given by- **f or approximately 
50 percent each.   It must be remembered that the fiber plates replace 
a glass window and a (mica) membrane, in addition to an optical 
output lens system. The efficiency **f of an **f lens at the magnification 
**f is: **f Neglecting absorption, the end losses of the coupling 
membrane and the output window **f would be 6 percent and 8 percent. 
Thus, the combined efficiency of the elements replaced by the two 
fiber plates (with a combined efficiency of 0.25) is 0.043 or <about 
six times less than that of the two fiber plates>. _GAIN OF FIBER 
COUPLED IMAGE INTENSIFIERS_ Including the brightness gain **f due 
to the **f area demagnification, the overall gain of a fiber coupled double 
stage image intensifier is: **f It is obvious that the careful 
choice of photocathode which maximizes **f for a given input ~<E> 
(in the case of the second stage, for the first phosphor screen emission) 
is very important. The same consideration should govern the choice 
of the second-stage phosphor screen for matching with the spectral 
sensitivity of the ultimate sensor (e&g&, photographic emulsion).

We have evaluated the "matching integrals" for two types 
of photocathodes (~S-11 and ~S-20) and three types of light input. 
The input light distributions considered are ~P-11 and ~P-20 
phosphor emission and the so-called "night light" (N&L&) 
as given by H&W& Babcock and J& J& Johnson. The integrals 
(in @ units) are listed in table 14-/1, below: 

#THEORETICAL 
DISCUSSION OF PARAXIAL DEVICE RESOLUTION#

_RESOLUTION LIMITATIONS 
IN A SINGLE STAGE_ The resolution limitations for a single stage are 
given by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system as 
well as the resolution capabilities of the cathodoluminescent viewing 
screen.   The resolution capabilities of an electrostatic system 
depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberrations. 
It has been stated previously that a minifying electrostatic system yields 
a lower resolution than a magnifying system or a system with unity 
magnification.   Furthermore, the chromatic aberrations depend 
on the chosen high voltage. In general, a high anode voltage reduces 
chromatic aberrations and thus increases the obtainable resolution.

The luminous gain of the discussed tube was calculated from Eq& 
(6) for the 16 possible combinations of ~S-11 and ~S-20 photocathodes 
and ~P-11 and ~P-20 phosphor screens, for night light 
and ~P-20 light input. (The ~P-20 input is of interest because 
it corresponds roughly to the light emission of conventional X-ray 
fluorescent screens). The following efficiencies obtained from ~JEDEC 
and ~RCA specifications were used: **f   The following 
table (14-/2,) lists the (luminous) gain values computed according 
to Eq& (6) with **f:   The possibility of a space charge 
blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundles has 
been pointed out. It is obvious that such an influence can only be 
expected in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output 
levels. Space charge influences will also decrease at increased 
voltages.   Electrostatic systems of the pseudo-symmetric type have 
been tested for resolution capabilities by applying electronography. 
A resolution of 70-80 line-pairs per millimeter appears to be feasible.

The inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor 
screen decreases with increasingly aggregate thickness (with increasing 
anode voltage), decreases with decreasing porosity (thus the advantage 
of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition) and might be impaired by the 
normally used aluminum mirror. Thus, in general, elementary light 
optical effects, light scatter, and electron scatter determine the obtainable 
resolution limit. It should be noted that photoluminescence, 
due to "Bremsstrahlung" generated within the viewing screen by electron 
impact, appears to be important only if anode voltages in excess 
of 30 ~KV are utilized. It has been stated that settled cathodoluminescent 
phosphor screens may have a limiting resolution of 60 **f 
at high voltage values of approximately 20 ~KV. For the further discussion, 
we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 **f 
and phosphor screen resolution of 60 **f. 
The set of all decisions is called the operating policy or, more simply, 
the policy. An optimal policy is one which in some sense gets the 
best out of the process as a whole by maximizing the value of the product. 
There are thus three components to an optimal design problem: 
_(1)_ The specification of the state of the process stream; _(2)_ 
The specification of the operating variables and the transformation 
they effect; _(3)_ The specification of the objective function 
of which the optimization is desired. For a chemical process 
the 
first of these might involve the concentrations of the different chemical 
species, and the temperature or pressure of the stream. For the 
second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cooling 
to be supplied; the way in which the transformation of state depends 
on the operating variables for the main types of reactors is discussed 
in the next chapter. The objective function is some measure of 
the increase in value of the stream by processing; it is the subject 
of Chapter 4.   The essential characteristic of an optimal policy 
when the state of the stream is transformed in a sequence of stages 
with no feedback was first isolated by Bellman. He recognized that 
whatever transformation may be effected in the first stage of an ~<R>-stage 
process, the remaining stages must use an optimal **f-stage policy 
with respect to the state resulting from the first stage, if there 
is to be any chance of optimizing the complete process. Moreover, by 
systematically varying the operating conditions in the first stage and 
always using the optimal **f-stage policy for the remaining stages, 
we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all ~R stages. Proceeding 
in this way, from one to two and from two to three stages, we
