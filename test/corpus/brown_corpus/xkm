and of those who have an opinion, that assessment by the town of location 
is preferred on the basis of their present knowledge. The need for 
greater knowledge is evident from their replies. 

#BOATS AS PERSONAL 
PROPERTY#

_TAXING OF BOATS._ Interest has been shown for a number 
of years by local assessors in the possibility of taxing boats. 
Assessors in Rhode Island are charged not only with placing a valuation 
upon real and personal property, but they also have the responsibility 
to raise by a tax "a sum not less than nor more than" a specified 
amount as ordered by a city council or financial town meeting.

It has been obvious to the assessors, particularly those in shore 
communities, that boats comprise the largest category of tangible personal 
property which they have been unable to reach. Through their 
professional organization, the Rhode Island Tax Officials Association 
the question of taxing boats long has been debated and discussed. 
No satisfactory solution has been found, but this is due more to the 
difficulties inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence 
on the part of the assessors.   It has been estimated that 
the value of boats in Rhode Island waters is something in excess 
of fifty million dollars, excluding commercial boats. It is obvious that 
this is a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessors 
of those towns where a substantial amount of such property would be 
subject to taxation.   It is known that at least five towns (Barrington, 
Bristol, Narragansett, Newport and Westerly) place some 
value on some boats for tax purposes. However, few are taxed, and 
the owners and location of most boats are unknown to the assessors on 
the date of assessment of town valuations.   No one really knows 
how many boats there actually are or what their aggregate value may 
be. Slightly more than 5,000 boats were registered with the Coast Guard 
prior to the recent passage of the state boating law. Only a few 
more than 10,000 boats had been registered with the Division of Harbors 
and Rivers at the end of the 1960 boating season, but many had 
been taken out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane brought 
the season to an early close.   The assessors' association, 
meeting at Narragansett in September 1960, devoted its session to a 
discussion of the boat problem.

Local industry's investment in Rhode Island was the big story 
in 1960's industrial development effort. Fifty-two companies started 
or committed themselves to new plant construction, totaling 1,418,000 
square feet and representing an investment of $11,900,000; a 
new post-World War /2, record. With minor exceptions, this expansion 
was instituted either by firms based in Rhode Island or out-of-state 
manufacturers already operating here.   What made these new 
location figures particularly impressive was the fact that although 1960 
was a year of mild business recession throughout the nation, Rhode 
Island scored marked progress in new industry, new plants, and new jobs.

Of the major expansions in 1960, three were financed under 
the R& I& Industrial Building Authority's 100% guaranteed 
mortgage plan: Collyer Wire, Leesona Corporation, and American 
Tube + Controls. Leading firms that arranged their own financing 
included Speidel Corporation, Cornell-Dubilier, Photek, Inc& 
Division of Textron, Narragansett Gray Iron Foundry, W& R& 
Cobb Company, and Mays Manufacturing Company.   Expansion 
and relocation of industry in Rhode Island is the direct responsibility 
of the Development Council's Industrial Division, and the figures 
quoted above indicate a successful year's operation. Industrial 
Division personnel worked with 54 out-of-state and 97 Rhode Island 
concerns during 1960, many of whom are still interested in a Rhode 
Island location. They are conscious of this state's new feeling 
of optimism and assurance and are definitely impressed by the number of 
new plants and construction projects in Rhode Island. _AIDS TO 
SMALL BUSINESS#

Although much of the Industrial Division's promotional 
effort is devoted to securing new locations and expansions by 
major industries, small business is also afforded considerable attention. 
Our Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce carries on a vigorous 
program, directly aimed at solving and expediting the problems of 
manufacturers in the lower employment categories.   A primary function 
is the operation of a Government Bid Center, which receives 
bids daily from the Federal Government's principal purchasing agencies. 
Assistance is rendered to interested Rhode Island businessmen 
concerning interpretation of bid invitations, where to obtain specifications, 
and follow-ups concerning qualification. During the past year, 
10,517 government bid invitations were received and 4,427 procurement 
leads were mailed to Rhode Island manufacturers.   In addition, 
the Office's domestic trade program provided consultant services 
to those seeking information on establishment of new businesses; 
how and where to apply for financial assistance; details on marketing; 
information concerning patents, copyrights and trade marks, availability 
of technical reports, and other subjects of interest to small 
business.   The Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce is 
also active in the field of international trade, assisting Rhode Island 
firms in developing and enlarging markets abroad. This office cooperates 
with the U& S& Department of Commerce in giving statewide 
coverage 
to services which include: statistics on markets abroad; locating 
foreign agents, buyers, distributors, etc&; information on 
foreign and domestic import duties and regulations, licensing, investments, 
and establishing of branch representatives or plants abroad, and 
documentary requirements concerning export shipments and arrangements 
for payment.   During the year 1960, this office supplied 954 visitors 
with information related to foreign and domestic commerce, and 
made 73 field visits. _ADVERTISING PROGRAM_ Our media advertising 
continued, during 1960, its previous effective program that stressed 
such specifics as 100% financing, plant availabilities, and location 
advantages. We also continued to run a series of ads featuring endorsement 
of Rhode Island by industrialists who had recently established 
new plants here.   To reach a still greater audience of location-minded 
manufacturers, our industrial advertising budget for the fiscal 
year was increased from $32,000 to $40,000, and the Industrial 
Building Authority's financial participation was upped from $17,000 
to $20,000.   Newspaper advertising was mainly concentrated in 
the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal (Eastern and Midwestern 
editions) which averaged two prominent ads per month, and to 
a lesser degree the New York Herald Tribune and, for the west coast, 
the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal (Pacific 
Coast edition). In addition to the regular schedule, advertisements 
were run for maximum impact in special editions of the New York Times, 
Boston Herald, American Banker, Electronic News and, for local 
promotion, the Providence Sunday Journal. Magazine advertising 
included Management Methods, the New Englander, U& S& Investor, 
and Plant Location.   The direct mail campaign consisted 
of 3 intra state mailings of 1680 letters each and 6 out-of-state directed 
to electronics, plastics, pharmaceutical, and business machine manufacturers, 
and to publishers. These totaled 6,768 pieces of correspondence.

The 1960 advertising campaign brought a total of 239 
inquiries; 164 from media and 75 from direct mail. Two hundred and 
nineteen were received from 35 of our 50 United States and 11 came from 
foreign countries. New York led in the number of inquiries, followed 
by California, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. 
Among foreign countries responding were Germany, Canada, Brazil and 
India. _INDUSTRIAL PROMOTION_ An important operation in soliciting 
industrial locations involves what we term "Missionary calls" 
by one of this Division's industrial promotion specialists. These 
consist of visits, without previous announcement, on top officials of 
manufacturing concerns located in highly industrialized areas. More 
than 25 carefully selected cities were visited, including New York, 
Brooklyn, Long Island City, Newark, Elizabeth, Stamford, Waterbury, 
New Haven, Bridgeport, Boston, Cambridge, Worcester, and 
Waltham.   Out of a total of 603 calls, 452 contacts were established 
with top executive personnel. We received 76 out-of-state visitors 
interested in investigating Rhode Island's industrial advantages, 
and Industrial Division personnel made 55 out-of-state follow-up 
visits. _INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCES_ During 1960, two important conferences 
were organized by the Development Council's Industrial Division. 
In June, the Office of Foreign and Domestic Commerce- 
in conjunction with local trade associations, chambers of commerce, 
and bank officials- sponsored a World Trade Conference at the Sheraton-Biltmore 
Hotel. Its purpose was to find ways of offsetting the 
United States' declining balance of trade for 1958 and 1959. Approximately 
100 representatives of business attended this conclave and 
the R& I& Export Conference Committee later voted to continue 
the activity as an annual event.   On October 8th of last year, 
the Industrial Division sponsored the Governor's Conference 
on Industrial Development at the former Henry Barnard School. A 
comprehensive program devoted to the various phases of the development 
effort attracted 143 interested individuals.   Morning sessions 
included addresses by Ward Miller, Jr& of the U& S& Dept& 
of Commerce. Richard Preston, executive director of the New Hampshire 
State Planning and Development Commission, and Edwin C& 
Kepler of General Electric Company. Workshop sessions in the afternoon 
featured development executives from Pennsylvania, Connecticut 
and Maine, and rounded out a rewarding program.   In connection 
with this conference, a 64-page supplement was published in the October 
2nd edition of the Providence Sunday Journal. Devoted to the 
improvement in business climate and increase in industrial construction 
in Rhode Island, it has proved a valuable mailing piece for this 
Division. More than 2000 copies have been sent out to prospective clients. 
_MAILINGS AND PUBLICATIONS_ Other special mailings by the 
Industrial Division included copies of speeches delivered at the Governor's 
Conference, letters and brochures to conferees at Med-Chemical 
Symposium at University of Rhode Island and letters and reprints 
of industrial advertisements to such organizations as Society 
of Industrial Realtors. 1184 copies of the R& I& Directory of 
Manufacturers were distributed: 643 in-state and 541 out-of-state.

The Industrial Division published, in 1960, a new, attractive 
industrial brochure, "Rhode Island- Right For Industry", 
and prepared 
copy for a new edition of the Directory of Manufacturers (to be 
printed shortly), and for a new space catalogue.   Additional promotional 
activities included organizing the dedication program for Operation 
Turnkey, the new automated post office, and a conference with 
representatives of Brown University, Providence College, and University 
of Rhode Island, and eight electronics concerns regarding 
the inauguration of a training program for electronics personnel. 

#PLANNING 
DIVISION#

Stated in its simplest terms, the main job of the 
Planning Division is to plan for the future of the State of Rhode 
Island. The activities of the Planning Division are defined in considerable 
detail in the enabling act of the Development Council, which 
assigns to the agency both broad responsibilities and specific duties 
in the field of planning.   Two years ago, the Institute of 
Public Administration issued an extremely comprehensive report entitled 
"State-Local Relations in Metropolitan Rhode Island. As 
the result of an exhaustive review of the recommendations contained in 
this report, plus an analysis of our own enabling act, the Planning 
Division developed a number of basic planning objectives which caused 
a reorientation of its work program. These objectives are stated here
