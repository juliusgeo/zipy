M& Beall, Francisco Archuleta and Juan Marcus appeared, both 
heavily armed, and after watching the house for a while, rode away. 
It was nearly sundown before they finished the business with Beall and 
began riding down the stream. They had traveled only a short distance 
when they spotted five Mexicans riding along a horse-trail across 
the stream just ahead of them. Suspecting an ambush, the two deputies 
decided to ride up a side canyon taking a short cut into Catskill.

After spending two nights (Wednesday and Thursday) in Catskill, 
the deputies again headed for the Vermejo to finish their business. 
They stayed with a rancher Friday night and by eleven o'clock 
Saturday morning passed the old Garnett Lee ranch. Half a mile below 
at the mouth of Salyer's Canyon was an old ranch that the company 
had purchased from A& J& Armstrong, occupied by a Mexican, 
his wife, and an old trapper. There were three houses in Salyer's 
Canyon just at the foot of a low bluff, the road winding along the top, 
entering above, and then passing down in front of the houses, thence 
to the Vermejo. To the west of this road was another low bluff, forty 
or fifty feet high, covered with scrub oak and other brush. As they 
were riding along this winding road on the bench of land between the 
two bluffs, a volley of rifle fire suddenly crashed around the two officers. 
Not a bullet touched Cook who was nearer the ambush, but one 
hit Russell in the leg and another broke his arm, passing on through 
his body.   With the first reports, Russell's horse wheeled 
to the right and ran towards the buildings while Cook, followed by a 
hail of bullets, raced towards the arroyo of Salyer's Canyon immediately 
in front of him, just reaching it as his horse fell. Grabbing 
his Winchester from its sheath, Cook prepared to fight from behind 
the arroyo bank. Bullets were so thick, throwing sand in his face, that 
he found it difficult to return the fire. Noticing Russell's horse 
in front of the long log building, he assumed his friend had slipped 
inside and would be able to put up a good fight, so he began working 
his way down the ditch to join him. At a very shallow place, two Mexicans 
rushed into the open for a shot. Dropping to one knee, Cook 
felled one, and the other struggled off with his comrade, sending no further 
fire in his direction. Just before leaving the arroyo where he 
was partially concealed, he did hear shots down at the house. 
Russell had reached the house as Cook surmised, dismounted, but just 
as the old trapper opened the door to receive him, he fell into the trapper's 
arms- dead. A bullet fired by one of the Mexicans hiding 
in a little chicken house had passed through his head, tearing a hole 
two-inches square on the outgoing side. Finding him dead, Cook caught 
Russell's horse and rode to the cattle foreman's house to report 
the incident and request bloodhounds to trail the assassins.

Before daylight Sunday morning, a posse of twenty-three men under 
the leadership of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson of Catskill followed 
the trail to the house of Francisco Chaves, where 100 to 150 
Mexicans had gathered. MacPherson boldly approached the fortified 
adobe house and demanded entrance. The men inside informed him that they 
had some wounded men among them but he would not be allowed to see 
them even though he offered medical aid. The officer demanded the names 
of the injured men; the Mexicans not only refused to give them, 
but told the possemen if they wanted a fight they could have it. Since 
the strength of the Mexicans had been underrated, too small a posse 
had been collected, and since the deputy had not been provided with 
search warrants, MacPherson and his men decided it was much wiser to 
withdraw.   The posse's retreat encouraged the Mexicans to 
be overbearing and impudent. During the following week, six tons of hay 
belonging to one rancher were burned; some buildings, farm tools, 
two horses, plows, and hay owned by Bonito Lavato, a friendly interpreter 
for the company, and Pedro Chavez' hay were stolen or destroyed; 
and a store was broken into and robbed. District Attorney M& 
W& Mills warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons caught 
committing these crimes or carrying arms- he just didn't catch 
anyone.   Increasing threats on his life finally convinced Cook 
that he should leave New Mexico. His friends advised that it would 
be only a question of time until either the Mexicans killed him by 
ambuscade or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense, perpetuating 
the troubles. By early summer, he wrote from Laramie that he 
was suffering from the wound inflicted in the ambush and was in a bad 
way financially, so Pels sent him a draft for $100, warning that it 
was still not wise for him to return. Pels also sent a check for $100 
to Russell's widow and had a white marble monument erected on his 
grave.   Cattle stealing and killing, again serious during the 
spring of 1891, placed the land grant company officers in a perplexing 
position. They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs to protect the property, 
thus running the risk of creating disturbances such as that on 
the Vermejo, and yet the cowboys protested that they got no salary 
for arresting cattle thieves and running the risk of being shot. And 
the law virtually ignored the situation. The judge became ill just as 
the Colfax District Court convened, no substitute was brought in, 
no criminal cases heard, only 5 out of 122 cases docketed were tried, 
and court adjourned sine die after sitting a few days instead of the usual 
three weeks. Pels complained: "Litigants and witnesses were 
put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact 
business; public money spent; justice delayed; nothing accomplished, 
and the whole distribution of justice in this county seems to 
be an absolute farce".   Word reached the company that the man 
behind these depredations was Manuel Gonzales, a man with many followers, 
including a number who were kept in line through fear of him. 
Although wanted by the sheriff for killing an old man named Asher Jones, 
the warrant for his arrest had never been served. On May 19, a 
deputy sheriff's posse of eight men left Maxwell City and rode thirty-five 
miles up the Vermejo where they were joined by Juan Jose 
Martinez. By 3:00 A&M& they reached his house and found it vacant. 
When they were refused entrance to his brother's house nearby, 
they smashed down the door, broke the window, and threw lighted clothes 
wet with kerosene into the room. Still there was no Gonzales and 
the family would say nothing.   About 300 yards up the creek was 
a cluster of Mexican houses containing six rooms in the form of a 
square. While prowling around these buildings, two of the posse recognized 
the voice of Gonzales speaking to the people inside. He was promised 
that no harm would befall him if he would come out, but he cursed 
and replied that he would shoot any man coming near the door. The 
posse then asked that he send out the women and children as the building 
would be fired or torn down over his head if necessary to take him 
dead or alive. Again he refused. In deadly earnest, the besiegers methodically 
stripped away portions of the roof and tossed lighted rags 
inside, only to have most stamped out by the women as soon as they hit 
the floor. When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer, 
taking a thousand to one chance Gonzales rushed outside, square against 
the muzzle of a Winchester. Shot near the heart, he turned to 
one side and plunged for a door to another room several feet away, three 
bullets following him. As he pushed open the door he fell on his 
face, one of his comrades pulling him inside.   Not realizing the 
seriousness of the wound, the besiegers warned that if he did not surrender 
the house would be burned down around him. Receiving no answer, 
they set the fire. When the house was about half consumed, his comrade 
ran to the door and threw up his hands, declaring repeatedly that 
he did not know the whereabouts of Manuel. Finding it true that he 
was not inside, the deputies returned to the first house and tore holes 
through the side and the roof until they could see a body on the bed 
covered by a blanket. Several slugs fired into the bed jerked aside 
the blanket to reveal an apparently lifeless hand. Shot six or eight 
times the body was draped with Russell's pistol, belt, and cartridges. 
There was no extra horse so it was left to his comrades who, though 
numbering in the fifties, had stood around on the hillside nearby 
without firing a shot during the entire attack.   Early the next 
morning, a Mexican telephoned Pels that Celso Chavez, one of the 
posse members, was surrounded by ten Mexicans at his father's home 
on the upper Vermejo. The sheriff and District Attorney Mills 
hastily swore 
out a number of warrants against men who had been riding about armed, 
according to signed statements by Chavez and Dr& I& P& George, 
and ordered Deputy Barney Clark of Raton to rescue the posseman. 
Traveling all night, Clark and twelve men arrived at about seven 
o'clock May 22. Occasionally they heard gun-shot signals and a 
number of horsemen were sighted on the hills, disappearing at the posse's 
approach. A Mexican justice of the peace had issue a writ against 
Chavez for taking part in the "murder" of Manuel Gonzales 
so he and his father were anxious to be taken out of danger. The men 
helped them gather their belongings and escorted them to Raton along 
with three other families desiring to leave.   The ten or more 
dangerous parties singled out for prosecution were still at large, and 
Pels realized that if these men entrenched themselves in their adobe 
houses, defending themselves through loopholes, it would be most difficult 
to capture them. Thus he wired J& P& Lower and Sons of 
Denver: "Have you any percussion hand grenades for throwing in a 
house or across a well loaded with balls or shrapnel shot? If not, 
how long to order and what is the price"? He wisely decided that 
it would be foolish to create a disturbance during the coming roundup, 
particularly since the Mexicans were on their guard. His problem 
then became one of restraining the American fighters who wanted to clean 
out the Vermejo by force immediately. 
The plant was located west of the Battenkill and south of the location 
of the former electric light plant.   The Manchester Depot 
Sewer Company issued 214 shares of stock at $10 each for construction 
of a sewer in that locality, and assessments were made for its maintenance. 
It has given considerable trouble at times and empties right 
into the Battenkill. Fire District No& 1 discussed its possible 
purchase in 1945, but considered it an unwise investment.   The 
sewer on Bonnet Street was constructed when there were only a few houses 
on the street. as new homes were built they were connected so that 
all residences south of School Street are served by it. B& J& 
Connell is the present treasurer and manager.   The 1946 town 
meeting voted to have the Selectmen appoint a committee to investigate 
and report on the feasibility of some system of sewage disposal and 
a disposal plant to serve Manchester Center, Depot, and Way's 
Lane. The committee submitted a report signed by Louis Martin and 
Leon Wiley with a map published in the 1946 town report. The layout 
of the sewer lines was designed by Henry W& Taylor, who was the 
engineer for the Manchester Village disposal plant. No figures were 
submitted with the report and no action was taken on it by the town.

The 1958 town meeting directed town authorities to seek federal 
and state funds with which to conduct a preliminary survey of a proposed 
sewage plant with its attendant facilities. The final step was a 
vote 
for a $230,000 bond issue for the construction of a sewage system by 
the 1959 town meeting, later confirmed by a two-thirds vote at a special 
town meeting June 21, 1960.   There the matter stands with 
the prospect that soon Manchester may be removed from the roster of 
towns contributing raw sewage to its main streams. #@ TELEPHONE AND 
TELEGRAPH#

MANCHESTER'S unusual interest in telegraphy has 
often been attributed to the fact that the Rev& J& D& Wickham, 
headmaster of Burr and Burton Seminary, was a personal friend and 
correspondent of the inventor, Samuel F& B& Morse. At any 
rate, Manchester did not lag far behind the first commercial system 
which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore and Washington.   In 
1846 Matthew B& Goodwin, jeweler and watchmaker, became the town's 
first telegrapher in a dwelling he built for himself and his business 
"two doors north of the Equinox House" or "one door north 
of the Bank, Manchester, Vermont". Goodwin was telegrapher for 
the "American Telegraph Company" and the "Troy and Canada 
Junction Telegraph Company". Shares of capital stock at $15 each 
in the latter company were payable at the Bank of Manchester or at 
various other Vermont banks. A message of less than fifteen words to
