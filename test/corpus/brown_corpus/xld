from such sale, and other relevant matters. _3._ The United States 
recognizes the desire of India to accumulate, as quickly as possible, 
a substantial part of the one million ton reserve stock of rice 
provided for in this Agreement to assist in stabilizing the internal 
markets for this commodity in India. Under this Agreement the first 
annual review of rice availabilities will be made in August 1960. 
At that time consideration will be given to whether in the light of 
the United States supplies of rice available for Title /1, disposal, 
India's production, consumption and stocks of food grains, other 
imports from the United States and countries friendly to the United 
States, India's storage capacity, and other related factors, any 
increase would be possible in the portion of the total rice programmed 
which is currently planned for procurement during the first year. _4._ 
The two Governments agree that the issuance of purchase authorizations 
for wheat and rice providing for purchase after June 30, 1961, 
shall be dependent upon the determination by the United States 
Government that these commodities are in surplus supply and available 
under Title /1, of the Act at that time. The United States Government 
shall have the right to terminate the financing of further sales 
under this Agreement of any commodity if it determines at any time 
after June 30, 1961, that such action is necessitated by the existence 
of an international emergency. 

#ARTICLE /2, USES OF RUPEES# 

_1._ The two Governments agree that the rupees accruing to the Government

as the Government of the United States of America shall determine, 
for the following purposes in the amounts shown: _(A)_ For United 
States expenditures under subsections (~a), (~b), (~d), (~e),

to the Government of India under subsection (~g) of Section 104 
of the Act, the rupee equivalent of not more than $538 million for 
financing such projects to promote balanced economic development as may 
be mutually agreed. The terms and conditions of the loan and other 
provisions will be set forth in a separate agreement by the two Governments.

In the event that agreement is not reached on the use 
of the rupees for grant or loan purposes within six years from the date 
of this Agreement, the Government of the United States of America 
may use the local currency for any purposes authorized by Section

equivalent of $1,276 million, the amounts available for the purposes 
specified in paragraph 1, Article /2, will be adjusted proportionately.

DWIGHT D& EISENHOWER   FOR THE GOVERNMENT 
OF INDIA:   S& K& PATIL 
EXCELLENCY:   I have the honor to refer to the Agricultural 
Commodities Agreement signed today between the Government of the 
United States of America and the Government of India (hereinafter 
referred to as the Agreement) and, with regard to the rupees accruing 
to uses indicated under Article /2, of the Agreement, to state 
that the understanding of the Government of the United States of 
America is as follows: _1._ With respect to Article /2,, Paragraph 
1 (~a) of the Agreement: _(/1,)_ The Government 
of India will provide facilities for the conversions of the rupee equivalent 
of $4 million (up to a maximum of $1 million per year) accruing 
under the subject agreement for agricultural market development purposes 
into currencies other than United States dollars on request of 
the Government of the United States of America. This facility is 
needed for the purpose of securing funds to finance agricultural market 
development activities of the Government of the United States in 
other countries.   The Government of the United States of America 
may utilize rupees in India to pay for goods and services, including 
international transportation needed in connection with market development 
and other agricultural projects and activities in India and 
other countries. _(/2,)_ The rupee equivalent of $63.8 million, 
but not more than 5 percent of the currencies received under the Agreement 
will be used for loans to be made by the Export-Import Bank 
of Washington under Section 104 (~e) of the Agricultural Trade 
Development and Assistance Act, as amended (hereinafter referred to 
as the Act), and for administrative expenses of the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington in India incident thereto. It is understood that: 
_(A)_ Such loans under Section 104 (~e) of the Act will 
be made to United States business firms and branches, subsidiaries, 
or affiliates of such firms in India for business development and trade 
expansion in India and to United States firms and to Indian firms 
for the establishment of facilities for aiding in the utilization, 
distribution, or otherwise increasing the consumption of and markets 
for United States agricultural products. In the event the rupees set 
aside for loans under Section 104 (~e) of the Act are not advanced 
within six years from the date of this Agreement because the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington has not approved loans or because proposed 
loans have not been mutually agreeable to the Export-Import Bank 
of Washington and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government 
of India, the Government of the United States of America 
may use the rupees for any purpose authorized by Section 104 of the 
Act. _(B)_ Loans will be mutually agreeable to the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington and the Government of India acting through 
the Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance. The 
Secretary, Department of Economic Affairs, or his designate, will 
act for the Government of India, and the President of the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington, or his designate, will act for the Export-Import 
Bank of Washington. _(C)_ Upon receipt of an application 
which the Export-Import Bank is prepared to consider, the Export-Import 
Bank will inform the Department of Economic Affairs 
of the identity of the applicant, the nature of the proposed business, 
the amount of the proposed loan, and the general purposes for which the 
loan proceeds would be expended. _(D)_ When the Export-Import 
Bank is prepared to act favorably upon an application, it will so notify 
the Department of Economic Affairs and will indicate the interest 
rate and the repayment period which would be used under the proposed 
loan. The interest rate will be similar to those prevailing in India 
on comparable loans and the maturities will be consistent with the 
purposes of the financing. _(E)_ Within sixty days after the receipt 
of notice that the Export-Import Bank is prepared to act favorably 
upon an application the Department of Economic Affairs will indicate 
to the Export-Import Bank whether or not the Department of 
Economic Affairs has any objection to the proposed loan. Unless within 
the sixty-day period the Export-Import Bank has received such 
a communication from the Department of Economic Affairs it shall be 
understood that the Department of Economic Affairs has no objection 
to the proposed loan. When the Export-Import Bank approves or declines 
the proposed loan, it will notify the Department of Economic 
Affairs. _2._ With respect to Article /2,, paragraphs 1 (~b) 
and 1 (~c): 
Uses of Section 104 (~e) and Section 104(~g) rupees: The 
Government of India will use the amount of rupees granted or loaned
