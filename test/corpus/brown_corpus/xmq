criticizing people who made mistakes, condemning them to too great an 
extent. He did not really listen to others, had little interest in their 
ideas, and wanted to have his own way- which was the only right 
way. The entire group of managers explained, in great detail, a number 
of human relations errors that he made.   One by one, these 
errors were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors. 
He admitted his behavior, and defended it. He refused to change 
his approach, and instead he attacked high and low- the officials for 
their not backing him, and subordinates for their laxness, stupidity, 
and stubbornness. After the diagnosing, he left the course, convinced 
that it could do him no good.   We may say that his problem 
was diagnosed but that he refused treatment. The engineer turned works 
manager had a particular view of life- and refused to change it. We 
may say that his attitude was foolish, since he may have been a success 
had he learned some human relations skills; or we may say that 
his attitude was commendable, showing his independence of mind, in his 
refusal to adjust to the opinions of others. In any case, he refused 
to accept the implications of the analysis, that he needed to be made 
over.   Another case may be given in illustration of a successful 
use of analysis, and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive 
analysis. In a course for supermarket operators, a district manager 
who had been recently appointed to his position after being outstandingly 
successful as a store manager, found that in supervising other 
managers he was having a difficult time. On playing some typical situations 
before a jury of his peers he showed some characteristics rated 
as unsatisfactory. He was told he displayed, for example, a sense 
of superiority- and he answered: "Well, I am supposed to know 
all the answers, aren't I"? He was criticized for his curtness 
and abruptness- and he answered: "I am not working to become 
popular". On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior- he answered: 
"I have to make decisions. That's my job". In short, 
as frequently happens in analyses, the individual feels threatened and 
defends himself. However, in this case the district manager was led 
to see the errors of his ways. The necessary step between diagnosis and 
training is acceptance of the validity of the criticisms. How this 
was accomplished may be described, since this sometimes is a crucial 
problem.   The director helped tailor-make a check list of the district 
manager's errors by asking various observers to write out sentences 
commenting on the mistakes they felt he made. These errors were 
then collected and written on a blackboard, condensing similar ideas. 
Eighteen errors were located, and then the director asked each individual 
to vote whether or not they felt that this manager had made the 
particular errors. They were asked to vote "true" if they thought 
they had seen him make the error, "false" if they thought he had 
not; and "cannot say" if they were not certain.   The manager 
sat behind the group so he could see and count the hands that went 
up, and the director wrote the numbers on the blackboard. No comments 
were made during the voting. The results looked as follows: **f.

The first eight of these eighteen statements, which received 
at least one-half of the votes, were duplicated to form an analysis 
checklist for the particular manager, and when this particular manager 
roleplayed in other situations, the members checked any items that appeared. 
To prevent the manager from deliberately controlling himself 
only during the sessions, they were rather lengthy (about twenty minutes), 
the situations were imperfectly described to the manager so that 
he would not know what to expect, new antagonists were brought on the 
scene unexpectedly, and the antagonists were instructed to deliberately 
behave in such ways as to upset the manager and get him to operate in 
a manner for which he had been previously criticized.   After 
every session, the check marks were totaled up and graphed, and in this 
way the supervisor's progress was charted. _SUMMARY_ In life 
we learn to play our roles and we "freeze" into patterns which become 
so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do. We can see 
others more clearly than we can see ourselves, and others can see us 
better than we see ourselves. To learn what we do is the first step 
for improvement. To accept the validity of the judgments of others is 
the second step. To want to change is the third step. To practice new 
procedures under guided supervision and with constant feedback is the 
fourth step. To use these new ways in daily life is the last step. 
Roleplaying used for analysis follows these general steps leading to 
training.   When an evaluative situation is set up, and no concern 
is with the details that lead to an over-all estimate, we say that 
roleplaying is used for evaluation. Observers can see a person engaged 
in spontaneous behavior, and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion. 
This behavior is more "veridical"- or true than other 
testing behavior for some types of evaluation, and so can give quick and 
accurate estimates of complex functioning.   While roleplaying 
for testing is not too well understood at the present time, it represents 
one of the major uses of this procedure. 

#CHAPTER /10, SPONTANEITY 
TRAINING#

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS CHAPTER is to clarify 
the distinctions between spontaneity theory and other training concepts. 
In addition, the basic approach utilized in applying roleplaying will 
be reviewed. The goal will be to provide the reader with an integrated 
rationale to aid him in applying roleplaying techniques in this 
unique training area. The reasons for extracting this particular roleplaying 
application from the previous discussion of training are twofold: 
_1._ Spontaneity training theory is unique and relatively new.

It is not easy for the therapist to discern when, in the patient's 
communicating, an introject has appeared and is holding sway. One 
learns to become alert to changes in his vocal tone- to his voice's 
suddenly shifting to a quality not like his usual one, a quality 
which sounds somehow artificial or, in some instances, parrotlike. The 
content of his words may lapse back into monotonous repetition, as 
if a phonograph needle were stuck in one groove; only seldom is it so 
simple as to be a matter of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom, 
common to our culture, which he has evidently heard, over and over, 
from a parent until he experiences it as part of him.   One hebephrenic 
woman often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow 
phony experience of pseudo-emotion, during which, despite her wracking 
sobs and streaming cheeks, I felt only a cold annoyance with her. 
Eventually such incidents became more sporadic, and more sharply demarcated 
from her day-after-day behavior, and in one particular session, 
after several minutes of such behavior- which, as usual, went on 
without any accompanying words from her- she asked, eagerly, "Did 
you see Granny"? At first I did not know what she meant; I 
thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from 
seeing 
her grandmother, in their distant home-city. Then I realized that 
she had been deliberately showing me, this time, what Granny was like; 
and when I replied in this spirit, she corroborated my hunch.

At another phase in the therapy, when a pathogenic mother-introject 
began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene, she muttered 
in a low but intense voice, to herself, "I hate that woman inside 
me"! I could evoke no further elaboration from her about this; 
but a few seconds later she was standing directly across the room 
from me, looking me in the eyes and saying in a scathingly condemnatory 
tone, "Your 
father despises you"! Again, I at first misconstrued 
this disconcertingly intense communication, and I quickly cast 
through my mind to account for her being able to speak, with such utter 
conviction, of an opinion held by my father, now several years deceased. 
Then I replied, coldly, "If you despise me, why don't you 
say so, directly"? She looked confused at this, and I felt sure 
it had been a wrong response for me to make. It then occurred to me to 
ask, "Is that what that woman told you"? She clearly agreed 
that this had been the case. I realized, now, that she had been showing 
me, in what impressed me as being a very accurate way, something her 
mother had once said to her; it was as if she was showing me one of 
the reasons why she hated that woman inside her. What had been an unmanageably 
powerful introject was now, despite its continuing charge 
of energy disconcerting to me, sufficiently within control of her ego 
that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother was like.

Earlier, this woman had been so filled with a chaotic variety 
of introjects that at times, when she was in her room alone, it would 
sound to a passerby as though there were several different persons in 
the room, as she would vocalize in various kinds of voice. A somewhat 
less fragmented hebephrenic patient of mine, who used to often seclude 
herself in her room, often sounded through the closed door- as I 
would find on passing by, between our sessions- for all the world 
like two persons, a scolding mother and a defensive child.   Particularly 
hard for the therapist to grasp are those instances in which 
the patient is manifesting an introject traceable to something in the 
therapist, some aspect of the therapist of which the latter is himself 
only poorly aware, and the recognition of which, as a part of himself, 
he finds distinctly unwelcome. I have found, time and again, that 
some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part 
of a patient rests, in the final analysis, on this basis; and only 
when I can acknowledge this, to myself, as being indeed an aspect of 
my personality, does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of 
the patient's behavior. For example, one hebephrenic man used to 
annoy me, month after month, by saying, whenever I got up to leave and 
made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the 
following day, or whenever, "You're welcome", in a notably condescending 
fashion- as though it were his due for me to thank him 
for the privilege of spending the hour with him, and he were thus pointing 
up my failure to utter a humbly grateful, "thank you" to him 
at the end of each session. Eventually it became clear to me, partly 
with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out my 
condescension to me somewhat more directly, that this man, with his 
condescending, 
"You're welcome", was very accurately personifying 
an element of obnoxious condescension which had been present in my own 
demeanor, over these months, on each of these occasions when I had 
bid him good-bye with the consoling note, each time, that the healing 
Christ would be stooping to dispense this succor to the poor suffered 
again on the morrow.   Another patient, a paranoid woman, for many 
months infuriated not only me but the ward-personnel and her fellow 
patients by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building, 
as though she were the only person in it whose needs were to be met. 
This behavior on her part subsided only after I had come to see the 
uncomfortably close similarity between, on the one hand, her arranging 
the ventilation of the common living room to her own liking, or turning 
the television off or on without regard to the wishes of the others, 
and on the other hand, my own coming stolidly into her room despite 
her persistent and vociferous objections, bringing my big easy chair 
with me, usually shutting the windows of her room which she preferred 
to keep in a very cold state, and plunking myself down in my chair- 
in short, behaving as if I owned her room. 

#4. CONDENSATION:# 

Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated, or reduced, 
in their communicative expression, to some comparatively simple-seeming 
verbal or nonverbal statement.   One finds, for example, 
that a terse and stereotyped 
verbal expression, seeming at first to be 
a mere hollow convention, reveals itself over the months of therapy 
as the vehicle for expressing the most varied and intense feelings, and 
the most unconventional of meanings. More than anything, it is the 
therapist's intuitive sensing of these latent meanings in the stereotype 
which helps these meanings to become revealed, something like a spread-out 
deck of cards, on sporadic occasions over the passage of the
