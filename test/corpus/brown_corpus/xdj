might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh, and those deprived of 
their happy hour at the cocktail bar.

In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning 
in the northern skies. This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the 
evening- flashes in the distance, but no storm.   Several times 
it came near breaking, and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder 
from Jerry Mulligan's big band, which is about as fine an aggregation 
as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond 
found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap.   Mulligan's 
band has been infected with his solid sense of swing, and what it 
does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the 
big concert aggregations.   But what is equally impressive is 
the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's 
baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement 
of "Django's Castle".   For subtle swinging rhythms, 
I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of "Weep", and 
the fireworks went on display in "18 Carrots for Robert", a sax 
tribute to Johnny Hodges.   There was considerable contrast 
between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The 
Jazz Messengers, who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such 
a small group. Unfortunately, Blakey doesn't choose to work much 
of the time in this vein. He prefers to have his soloist performing 
and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.

What we did get, however, was impressive.   A few drops 
of rain just before midnight, when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of 
her first number, scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly, 
but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand, most of the listeners 
didn't care whether they got wet.   Miss Vaughan was back 
in top form, somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time- 
like a fine wine. After the spate of female vocalists we have been 
having, all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried 
to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat, it seemed 
that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than 
ever. 

#JAZZ THREE OPEN PROGRAM#

The evening program was opened 
by the Jazz Three, a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein 
on bass, Jack Warner, drums, and Don Cook, piano. This was a 
continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night 
when the Eddie Stack group, also local talent, went on first. 
Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple 
purpose: it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in 
this unenviable spot, when the audience is cold, restless, and in flux; 
it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have 
come a long way to hear, and it gives the resident musicians a chance 
to perform before the famous Newport audience.   The Jazz Three 
displayed their sound musicianship, not only in their own chosen set, 
but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns + Leon James, the 
superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three 
successive years, gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution 
of the blues to a spot on the evening program. 

#JULIE WILSON 
SINGS#

Julie Wilson, a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists, 
sang a set, a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old 
oldies as "Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah", and 
the delightful "Sunday". She frosted the cake with the always reliable 
"Bill Bailey".   From this taste of the 1920s, we 
leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz, 
which did lovely, subtle things for "Baubles, Bangles and Beads", 
and a couple of ballards.   Getz is a difficult musician to categorize. 
He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone, rather than 
for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations, and he has 
a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising 
is over. In this he is sticking with tradition, however far removed 
from it he may seem to be. 

#SHEARING TAKES OVER#

George Shearing 
took over with his well disciplined group, a sextet consisting of 
vibes, guitar, bass, drums, Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer. 
He met with enthusiastic audience approval, especially when he swung 
from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo. Shearing, himself, 
seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport 
appearances.   A very casual, pleasant program- one of those 
easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a 
relaxing delight- was held again under sunny skies, hot sun, and a fresh 
breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came 
to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach.   Divided 
almost equally into two parts, it consisted of "The Evolution of 
the Blues", narrated by Jon Hendricks, who had presented it last 
year at the Monterey, Calif&, Jazz Festival, and an hour-long session 
of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra, a blasting big band.

Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small 
audience of small children right on stage with him. Tracing the blues 
from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country 
and the West Indies, he stressed the close relationship between 
the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches. 

#SURPRISE 
ADDITION#

To help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz 
he had "Big" Miller, as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean, Gospel-singer, 
while Oscar Brown Jr&, an extremely talented young 
man, did a slave auctioneer's call, a field-hands' work song, and 
a beautifully sung Negro lullaby, "Brown Baby", which was one of 
the truly moving moments of the festival.   One of those delightful 
surprise additions, which so frequently occur in jazz programs, 
was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones, drumming 
to "Old Man River", which seems to have been elected the favorite 
solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts.

Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues 
was Michael Babatunde Olatunji, who plays such native drums as 
the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest. He 
has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of 
last year's afternoon concerts.   Hendricks had Billy Mitchell, 
tenor 
sax; Pony Poindexter, alto sax; Jimmy Witherspoon, 
blues singer (and a good one), and the Ike Isaacs Trio, which has done 
such wonderful work for two afternoons now, helping him with the musical 
examples.   It all went very well.

PIANISTS who are serious about their work are likely to know 
the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas. Music 
lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent 
example, played for ~RCA by Emil Gilels. He has chosen Sonata 
Op& 53 in ~D. The playing takes both sides of the disc. Perhaps 
one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often 
is their great length. Rhythmic interest, melodic beauty and the expansiveness 
of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention 
with the Gilels playing. His technique is ample and his musical ideas 
are projected beautifully.   The male chorus of the Robert 
Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style. The group is superbly 
trained. What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type 
of song is in question. Do you say chantey, as if the word were derived 
from the French word chanter, to sing, or do you say shanty and think 
of a roughly built cabin, which derives its name from the French-Canadian 
use of the word chantier, with one of its meanings given as 
a boat-yard? I say chantey. Either way, the Robert Shaw chorus 
sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame 
spelled out in terms of agreeable listening. If your favorite song 
is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.   The London label offers 
an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini, a baritone whose fame 
is international.

MURRAY LOUIS and his dance company appeared at the Henry 
Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons 
in the premiere of his latest work, "Signal", and the repetition 
of an earlier one, "Journal".   "Signal" is choreographed 
for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais. 
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg. Program note reads 
as follows:   "Take hands **h this urgent visage beckons us".

Here, as in "Journal", Mr& Louis has given himself 
the lion's share of the dancing, and there is no doubt that he is 
capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting 
physical movements. Indeed, both "Journal" and "Signal" 
qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.

But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative, and 
it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing. 
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations 
could be transposed without notable loss of effect, there is 
too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.

It may be, of course, that Mr& Louis is consciously trying to create 
works that anticipate an age of total automation. But it may be, 
also, that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics 
at the present time. One thing is certain, however, and that is that 
he is far more slavish to the detailed accents, phrasings and contours 
of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be. @ 
#'AN AMERICAN JOURNEY'#

A brisk, satirical spoof of contemporary 
American mores entitled "An American Journey" was given its 
first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night 
by the Helen Tamiris-Daniel Nagrin Dance Company. Choreographed 
by Mr& Nagrin, the work filled the second half of a program that 
also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' "Once 
Upon a Time **h" as well as her "Women's Song" and 
Mr& Nagrin's "Indeterminate Figure".   Eugene Lester 
assembled a witty and explicit score for "An American Journey", 
and Malcolm McCormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes.

Mr& Nagrin has described four "places", each with its scenery 
and people, added two "diversions", and concluded with "A 
Toccata for the Young", a refreshingly underplayed interpretation 
of rock'n'roll dancing.   The "places" could be anywhere, 
the idiosyncrasies 
and foibles observed there could be anybody's, and 
the laugh is on us all. But we need not mind too much, because Mr& 
Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever 
almost all the way.   Miss Tamiris' "Once Upon a Time 
**h" is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three "figures" 
that bother them somehow.   Unfortunately, the man and 
woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the 
menacing figures failed to make them any more so. Nor did the dancing 
involved really seize the attention at any time. The music here, Russell 
Smith's "Tetrameron", sounded good.   All the performances 
of the evening were smooth and assured, and the sizable company,
