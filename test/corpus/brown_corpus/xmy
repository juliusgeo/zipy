and the prospect may be poor if the training is aimed solely 
at jobs in the local community. If there is adequate information on job 
opportunities for skilled jobs elsewhere, many more workers can be 
expected to respond.   Another problem is who will pay for the training. 
Local school districts are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic 
about vocational training. Programs usually are expanded only 
when outside funds are available or local business leaders demand 
it. Even industrial development leaders find it hard to win local support 
for training unless a new industry is in sight and requests it. State 
governments have been taking the lead in establishing area vocational 
schools, but their focus is still on area job opportunities. Only 
the Federal government is likely to be able to take a long-run and 
nation-wide view and to pay for training to meet national skilled manpower 
needs.   If only state funds were used to pay for the vocational 
education, it could be argued that the state should not have to 
bear the cost of vocational training which would benefit employers in 
other states. However, if Federal funds are used, it would be entirely 
appropriate to train workers for jobs which could be obtained elsewhere 
as well as for jobs in the area of chronic unemployment. Such training 
would increase the tendency of workers to leave the area and find 
jobs in other localities.   A further possibility is suggested 
by the example of the G& I& bills and also by some recent trends 
in attitudes toward improving college education: that is to provide 
financial assistance to individuals for vocational training when local 
facilities are inadequate. This probably would require some support 
for subsistence as well as for tuition, but the total would be no 
greater than for the proposals of unemployment compensation or a Youth 
Conservation Corps. A maximum of $600 per year per student would 
enable many to take training away from home.   A program of financial 
assistance would permit placing emphasis on the national interest 
in training highly skilled labor. Instead of being limited to the poor 
training facilities in remote areas, the student would be able to 
move to large institutions of concentrated specialized training. Such 
specialized training institutions could be located near the most rapidly 
growing industries, where the equipment and job experience exist 
and 
where the future employment opportunities are located. This would heighten 
possibilities for part-time cooperative, on-the-job and extension 
training.   Personal financial assistance would enable more 
emphasis to be placed on the interests of the individual. His aptitudes 
and preferences could be given more weight in selecting the proper 
training.

But briefly, the topping configuration must be examined for its 
inferences. Then the fact that the lower channel line was pierced had 
further forecasting significance. And then the application of the 
count rules to the width (horizontally) of the configuration give us an 
intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline. The very idea 
of their being "count rules" implies that there is some sort of proportion 
to be expected between the amount of congestive activity and 
the extent of the breakaway (run up or run down) movement. This expectation 
is what really "sold" point and figure. But there is no positive 
and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strictest sense. 
Experience will show that only the vaguest generalities apply, and 
in fine, these merely dwell upon a relationship between the durations 
and intensities of events. After all, too much does not happen too 
suddenly, nor does very little take long.   The advantages and disadvantages 
of these two types of charting, bar charting and point and 
figure charting, remain the subject of fairly good natured litigation 
among their respective professional advocates, with both methods enjoying 
in common, one irrevocable merit. They are both trend-following 
methods. Even if we strip their respective claims to the barest minimum, 
the "odds" still favor them both, for the trend in effect is 
always 
more likely to continue than to reverse.   Of course, many 
more things are charted besides prices. The foregoing have been methods 
of charting prices, but now let us look at some of the other indices 
that are customarily charted, and which are looked to for their forecasting 
abilities. _THE QUEST FOR METHODS_ The search for forecasting 
formulae is ceaseless. Correlations have been worked up between 
the loading of freight cars and the course of stock price. The theory 
behind this is, of course, fundamentalist in character. As the number 
of reported freight car loadings increased, this was taken to indicate 
increased industrial activity, and consequently increased stock earnings, 
implying fatter dividends, and implying therefore increased stock 
market prices. We now know that things rarely ever work out in such 
cut-and-dried fashion, and that car loadings, while perhaps interesting 
enough, are nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn 
before stock prices turn.   But the quest for such an index 
goes on ceaselessly, with all manner of investors and speculators participating, 
ranging from the sedate institutional type virtually to the 
proverbial shoe-string operator, all seeking doggedly, studiously, daily- 
and often nightly- for the enchanting index that will foretell 
the eternal secret: Which way will the market move; up or down? 
It recalls to mind the quest of olden times for the fountain of youth, 
a quest heavily invested in, during the days of wooden ships. Just 
as heavily invested are the endeavors of multitudes of modern men who 
carry on the quest for the enchanting index. The quest offers careers. 
Much of this goes on in offices high up in Wall Street's lofty 
wind-swept towers.   There sit men who make moving averages of 
weekly volume, monthly averages of price-earnings ratios, ratios of 
the number of advances to the number of declines, ratios of an individual 
stock's performance to overall market performance, ratios of rising 
price volume to falling price volume, odd-lot indices, and what not. 
They are concerned with all things traded in, securities, bonds, cocao, 
coffee, soybeans, cotton, tin, oats, etc&.   And along 
Chicago's 
West Jackson Boulevard, La Salle Street, and around the 
Merchandise Mart Plaza there sit men who chart crop reports, who divide 
the number of reported lady-bugs by the number of reported green-bugs, 
and the number of hogs by the amount of corn. They plot the open 
interest curves, rainfall curves, and they even divide Democratic 
congressmen by Republican congressmen. All these things and countless 
more enter into their calculations, and yet, the enchanting index remains 
non-forthcoming. Not, at any rate, in the fuller sense of the word.

The markets are far too subtle, and the last word in these 
endeavors will doubtless never be written, for the enchanting index 
is about as nebulous as the fountain of youth.   But whereas civilized 
men no longer pursue the fountain, they never abandoned their pursuit 
of the enchanting index.   We mentioned odd-lot indices a 
few paragraphs ago. In the stock market, the normal trading package 
is a hundred shares, just as 5,000 bushels is the standard grain contract 
package. A stock transaction for less than a hundred shares is executed 
via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange. This 
results in a separate record being made, distinguishing these trades 
from the overall volume of trading.   According to the theory underlying 
odd-lot indices, the trader who trades odd lots is most likely 
a small trader, one who can't afford to trade round lots. Or, to 
use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast, they represent 
a sampling of the least sophisticated echelon of traders. Falling 
most easily prey to an adverse market movement, for this rank of traders 
can least afford to lose, virtually anything the odd-lot traders 
do, marketwise, is taken to exemplify the "wrong" thing to do.

Figures reporting the volume of odd-lot purchases and odd-lot sales 
are released by the stock exchange and carried in the newspapers. 
Odd-lot index observers then make graphs of the data according to their 
particular statistical recipe. They might, for example, plot it exactly 
as is, or they might make ten day moving averages of it, or longer 
moving averages, or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchases 
to odd-lot sales. The particular recipe is a matter of individual 
taste. The data is now interpreted in conjunction with a price 
chart, usually of a popular stock average.   Towards the end of 
an intermediate or major rise, while the top is forming on the price 
chart, it is frequently observed that the odd-lot buying increases sharply. 
This warns the chartist that the formation in progress is quite 
likely to be a top. Similarly, at the opposite end of the market cycle, 
towards the end of an intermediate or major decline, usually while 
the bottom is being formed on the price chart, it is characteristic 
that an increase is noticed in odd-lot selling again alerting the chartist 
that a bottom is becoming a greater likelihood. Thus, in the aggregate, 
the odd-lot trader is one who buys at the tops and sells at the 
bottoms, notwithstanding occasional individual exceptions.   While 
it had long been known in general, that "the public is always wrong", 
the use of odd-lot indices now puts the adage on a statistical 
basis.   One might well wonder why the "public is always wrong" 
and the question raised is about as awkward as the one concerned 
with the chicken and the egg. Which came first? Is it really that 
the "public" buys at the tops, and not that the market tops out when 
the "public" buys? And the converse at bottoms. Does the "public" 
usually sell at bottoms, or does the market usually bottom 
out when the "public" sells?   We have been using the word 
"public" in quotation marks, that is, in its vernacular connotation 
with reference to the odd-lot index theory. Obviously someone has 
to sell in order for someone to buy, and vice versa. And while all concerned 
are members of the literal public, somewhat less than all concerned, 
although still a majority, form the quotation marked "public". 
And the public minus the "public" leaves the so-called "sophisticated" 
element- the element on the other end of the "public's" 
transactions.   This element is often called "strong 
hands". Strong hands differ from "weak hands" in that their operations 
are the primary movers. They initiate campaigns, so to speak, 
even if this initiation is diffused among them, and their concerted action 
only psychologically organized. Strong hands act; weak hands 
react. Strong hands move first; weak hands ask, What is going on? 
When strong hands buy, they are able to buy more, and they do it even 
in the face of bearish news reports. They are able to sit more patiently 
with what they have bought. Needless to say, strong hands are 
not eager to be joined by weak hands, for this increases the risk that 
they will have to absorb what these weak hands unload on the way up, 
at higher prices, during the run-up phase of the campaign.   Certain 
badly disillusioned market critics are often apt to feel that there 
is something somehow unfair, dirty, or even thoroughly criminal about 
this interplay of competitive forces. But after all, can anyone imagine 
a market wherein the reverse of these things were true? Try to 
imagine a market in which only a minority of traders would lose, and 
the majority would make consistent profits. How much and how many profits 
could a majority take out of the losses of a few?   Moreover, 
the taunt concerning the "sophisticated" echelon and its alleged 
erudition is put to test during every campaign, and accrues only 
upon results; not before. It quite often happens that campaigns go 
askew, resulting in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hands 
into played-out hands, just as a member of a former campaign's "public" 
may emerge flatteringly "right" the next time. Membership 
in the echelons fluctuates too.   The study of odd-lot indices 
is somehow akin to the spectacle of a man trying to outfox his own shadow, 
what with all observers trying to get on the side of the "few" 
at the same time. The usefulness of this study and of configuration 
analysis as well, declines in direct proportion to the dissemination 
of its use. It has to, by virtue of the very dictionary definition of 
the word "few".   Diametric opposition must persist as to 
the future course of prices, if there is to persist a market at all. And 
the few must win what the many lose, for the opposite arrangement 
would not support markets as we know them at all, and is, in fact, unimaginable. 
There need be no squeamishness about admitting this. Anyone 
still doubting that this is the only way markets can be is invited 
to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently wins what 
the minority loses.   Mr& John Magee, whose work has been discussed 
in this chapter, was quoted in a New Yorker magazine profile
