completed removal to our new plant. 

#BRITISH SUBSIDIARY#

During 
the year our British subsidiary, Leesona-Holt, Limited, expanded 
its plant in Darwen, England, and added machine tool capacity. The 
operations of its other plant in Rochdale and Leesona's former operations 
in Manchester were transferred to a recently acquired plant 
in the adjoining town of Heywood. Layout and equipment were modernized 
and improved to obtain increased production on an efficient basis. 
The area available at Heywood is approximately three times the size 
of the former Rochdale and Manchester locations. In addition, land 
has been purchased to permit doubling the size of the plant in the future. 

#FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS#

The new Warwick plant is being built 
at our expense and under our direction. It will be transfered on 
completion to The Industrial Foundation of Rhode Island, a non-profit 
organization, which will reimburse us for the cost of construction. 
we will then occupy the new plant under lease, with an option to purchase. 
These arrangements are, in our opinion, very favorable to Leesona. 
Interim financing of construction costs is provided by a short 
term loan from The Chase Manhattan Bank.   In addition to expenditures 
on the Warwick plant, we have invested approximately $1,961,000 
for machinery and equipment at Cranston, and for new machinery, 
plant and equipment at Leesona-Holt, Limited. We believe that these 
improved facilities will contribute income and effect savings which 
will fully justify the investment.   Long term loans have been 
reduced by $395,000 to $2,461,000. Inventories increased $625,561 to 
$8,313,514 during the year and should decline in coming months. Thus 
we enter 1961 in a strong financial position. 

#EMPLOYEE CONTRACTS# 

In accordance with the two-year contract signed in May, 1959, with 
the International Association of Machinists, ~AFL-CIO, wages 
of hourly employees were increased by 4% in May, 1960, and pay levels 
for non-exempt salaried employees were increased proportionately. 
In addition, Blue Cross coverage for all employees and their dependents 
was extended to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital 
accommodations. 

#PERSONNEL BENEFITS#

In addition to direct salaries 
and wages, the Company paid or accrued during the year the following 
amounts for the benefit of employees: @   During the pension 
year ended December 31, 1960, 23 employees retired, making a total 
of 171 currently retired under the Company's pension plan. At 
December 13, 1960 the fund held by the Industrial National Bank of 
Providence, as trustee for payment of past and future service pensions 
to qualified members of the plan, totaled $2,412,616.

The basic market for textiles is growing with the expansion of 
the population that began 20 years ago. Another growth factor is increased 
consumer demand for better quality and larger quantities of fabrics 
that go with a rising standard of living.   As in many other 
industries, rising costs and intense competition, both domestic and 
foreign, have exerted increasing pressure on earnings of the textile industry 
in recent years. 

#INCREASED EFFICIENCY#

In textiles, as elsewhere, 
a major part of the solution lies in greater efficiency and 
higher productivity.   As a designer and manufacturer of textile 
production machinery, Leesona and other companies in its industry have 
sought to meet this challenge with new or improved equipment and methods 
that would increase production, yet maintain both quality and flexibility. 

#PROBLEMS OF SHIFTING STYLES#

The problem of efficient 
production in textiles is complicated by the fact that the industry serves 
large markets which shift quickly with changes of fashion in apparel 
or home decoration. Production must be adjusted accordingly, at 
minimum cost and quickly.   In addition, production machinery must 
in many cases be designed to handle with equal efficiency both natural 
fibers and the increasing number of synthetics, as well as blends. 
Following the term of service in Japan, each emissary returns for a 
brief visit to the campus to interpret his experience to the college 
community. The Carleton Service Fund provides the financial support 
for this program. 

#MUSICAL ACTIVITIES#

THE COLLEGE was one 
of the first to recognize the importance of music not only as a definite 
part of the curriculum but as a vital adjunct to campus life. Extensive 
facilities for group performance are provided by maintaining, under 
skilled direction, the Choir, the Orchestra, the Band, the Glee 
Club, and smaller ensembles of wind and string players.   All 
students are invited to participate in any of the musical organizations 
for which they qualify. Orchestra, Band, and Choir have auditions 
during the week preceding the first day of classes. The Glee Club 
is open to all students and faculty with no auditions necessary for 
membership.   In addition to the many appearances of these organizations 
throughout the college year, there are concerts by students of 
the music department, by members of the music faculty, and by visiting 
artists.   Student musical organizations are the Knights of 
Carleton and the Overtones (men's vocal groups), and the Keynotes 
(a women's singing group). These student-directed organizations include 
eight to ten members each; they perform at many campus social 
events. 

#RELIGIOUS ACTIVITIES#

FROM THE FOUNDING of the College 
those responsible for its management have planned to provide its 
students favorable conditions for personal religious development and to 
offer opportunities through the curriculum and otherwise for understanding 
the meaning and importance of religion. Courses are offered in 
ethics, the philosophy and history of religion, Christian thought and 
history, and the Bible. Carleton aims throughout its entire teaching 
program to represent a point of view and a spirit which will contribute 
to the moral and religious development of its students.   A 
COLLEGE SERVICE OF WORSHIP is held each Sunday morning at eleven 
o'clock in the Chapel. The sermons are given by the College Chaplain, 
by members of the faculty, or by guest preachers. Music is furnished 
by the Carleton College Choir.   CHAPEL SERVICES 
are held weekly. These services at which attendance is voluntary are 
led by the Chaplain, by the President of the College, by selected 
faculty members, students, and visitors. The service is brief and variety 
in forms of worship is practiced.   A SUNDAY EVENING PROGRAM 
provides theological lectures, music, drama, and films related 
to the issues of the Judeo-Christian tradition.   ATTENDANCE 
is required at the College Service of Worship <or> at the Sunday 
Evening Program <or> at any regularly organized service of public 
worship. Each semester every student must attend ten of the services 
or religious meetings. Attendance at the Chapel Service is voluntary.

RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS include the groups described 
below. The Y&M&C&A& and Y&W&C&A& at Carleton 
are connected with the corresponding national organizations and carry 
out their general purposes. Occasional meetings are held for the 
whole membership, usually with a guest speaker, while smaller discussion 
groups meet more frequently. The Associations sponsor many traditional 
campus events and provide students with opportunities to form new 
friendships, to broaden their interests, and to engage in worthwhile 
service projects.   There are other organizations representing 
several of the denominational groups. Included are the following: Baptist 
Student Movement, Canterbury Club (Episcopal), Christian 
Science Organization, Friends' Meeting for Worship, Hillel (Jewish), 
Liberal Religious Fellowship, Lutheran Student Association, 
Newman Club (Roman Catholic), Presbyterian Student Fellowship, 
United Student Fellowship (Congregational-Baptist), and Wesley 
Fellowship (Methodist).   Student religious organizations 
are co-ordinated under the Religious Activities Committee, a standing 
committee of the Carleton Student Association.   THE NORTHFIELD 
CHURCHES include the following: Alliance, Congregational-Baptist, 
Episcopal, Lutheran (Norwegian, Danish, Missouri Synod, 
and Bethel), Methodist, Moravian, Pentecostal, and Roman Catholic. 

#THEATER#

THE PURPOSE of producing plays at the College 
is three-fold: to provide the Carleton students with the best possible 
opportunity for theater-going within the limits set by the maturity 
and experience of the performers and the theatrical facilities available; 
to encourage the practice of attending the theater; and 
to develop a discriminating audience for good drama and sensitive performance.

Dramatic activity at the College is organized and carried 
on by The Carleton Players, which is to say by all students who 
are so inclined to advance these aims.   For the 1960-1961 season, 
The 
Carleton Players have announced <Blood Wedding> by Federico 
Garcia Lorca, <The Knight of the Burning Pestle> by Beaumont 
and Fletcher and <A Moon for the Misbegotten> by Eugene O'Neill, 
with a pre-season production of <The Glass Menagerie> by Tennessee 
Williams. 

#STUDENT WORKSHOP#

THIS workshop, located 
in Boliou Hall, provides facilities for students to work in ceramics, 
weaving, enameling, welding, woodworking, textile printing, printmaking, 
and lapidary. These extra-curricular activities are conducted 
under supervision of the Director of the Student Workshop. The 
workshop is open five afternoons and two evenings each week. 
A student organization, Bottega, is open to any student interested in 
increasing his understanding and appreciation of the graphic and ceramic 
arts in their historical, technical, and productive contexts. The 
group meets once a week in the Boliou Student Workshop. They are 
assisted and advised by members of the Art Department. 

#ATHLETICS# 

THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM at Carleton is considered an integral 
part of the activities of the College and operates under the same 
budgetary procedure and controls as the academic work.   The physical 
education program for men recognizes the value of participation 
in competitive sports in the development of the individual student and 
aims to give every man an opportunity to enter some form of athletic 
competition, either intercollegiate or intramural.   The same standards 
for admission, for eligibility to receive scholarships or grants-in-aid, 
and for scholastic performance at college apply to all students.
