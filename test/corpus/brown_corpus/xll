people in the industry that it is probably unrealistic to 
expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15% or better that characterized 
the decade of the 1950's, and that our military markets 
may be entering upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapons 
systems will give way to concentration of still undeveloped areas 
of our defense capability. While this may well be true in general, I 
believe it is also important to keep in mind that some recent developments 
suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be 
one of the most strongly growing areas in an economy which is not expanding 
rapidly in other directions.   Among the items scheduled 
for acceleration in the near future are the POLARIS and ~B70 
programs, strengthening of the airborne alert system of the Strategic 
Air Command, and improved battlefield surveillance systems. Research 
and development expenditures connected with the reconnaissance satellite 
SAMOS and the future development of ballistic missile 
defense systems such as NIKE-ZEUS are expected to increase substantially. 
Research, development test and evaluation funds, devoted 
to missiles in 1960 were 3 to 4 times as large as those devoted to aircraft, 
and actual missile procurement is expected to exceed aircraft procurement 
by 1963. Still later, the realm of space technology will show 
substantial gains; it has been estimated that spending by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration will rise from less than 
$500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $2 billion by 1967, and that 
the electronic industry's share of these expenditures will be closer 
to 50% than the current 20%.   The stepped up defense procurement 
called for in the 1961 Budget has already begun to make itself 
felt in an upturn in orders for military electronic equipment and 
the components that go into it, and it has been suggested that an additional 
$2 billion increase in total defense spending may be requested 
for fiscal 1962. Although the impact of these increases on our industry's 
shipments will be gradual, on balance I look for another good 
increase in shipments in the coming year, to at least $6 billion. 

#INDUSTRIAL 
ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT#

Paced by the continuing rapid growth 
of electronic data processing, sales of industrial and commercial electronic 
equipment totalled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in 1959. 
The market for computers and other data-handling continues to expand 
at the rate of about 30% annually, reaching some $450 million in 
1960. Informed estimates look for this market to approximately quadruple 
by the late 1960's, under the stimulus of new applications in 
the fields of banking and retailing, industrial process control, and information 
storage and retrieval. In the industrial field, prospects 
for higher expenditures on electronic testing and measuring equipment 
are also quite bright. For the near term, however, it must be realized 
that the industrial and commercial market is somewhat more sensitive 
to general business conditions than is the military market, and for this 
reason I would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat smaller 
than those of recent years; sales should slightly exceed 1960, however, 
and reach $1.9 billion. 

#REPLACEMENT PARTS#

In addition to 
the three major original equipment segments of the electronics business, 
the steady growth in the market for replacement parts continues 
year by year. This is now a $1.0 billion business, up from $0.9 billion 
in 1959, and should reach $1.1 billion in 1961.   The markets 
for electronic parts in 1960 have reflected the changing patterns of 
the various end equipment segments of the industry. Demand for parts 
for home entertainment was strong in the first half, but purchases were 
cut back to lower levels during the fall as set manufacturers reduced 
their own operating rates. In the military field, incoming orders turned 
down early in the year, and remained rather slow until late fall 
when the upturn in procurement of equipment began to make itself felt 
in rising orders for components.   Sales of transistors in 1960 
exceeded $300 million, compared to $222 million in 1959 despite substantial 
price reductions in virtually all types. Production totalled about 
123 million units against 82 million in 1959, and I look for a further 
gain to 188 million units worth approximately $380 million in 1961. 
Sales of passive components, such as capacitors and resistors, although 
not growing as fast as those of semi-conductors were ahead of 
1959 this year, and should increase again in 1961.   In sum, I 
look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961, with 
total sales increasing about 7% to $10.8 billion, despite the uncertainties 
in the business outlook generally. As I have indicated above, 
I base this feeling on a belief that current weakness in the market 
for consumer durable goods may continue through the early months of 
the year, but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery later on 
to bring the full-year figures close to those of 1960; on prospects 
for continued increases in defense spending; and on continued growth 
in the applications of electronics to the complex problems of manufacturing 
and trade in the expanding but competitive economy of the 1960's.

The appointment of Gilbert B& Devey as General Manager 
of VecTrol Engineering, Inc&, of Stamford, Connecticut, a leading 
manufacturer of thyratron and silicon controlled rectifier electrical 
controls, has been announced by David B& Peck, Vice President, 
Special Products.   Mr& Devey will be responsible for the 
commercial expansion of VecTrol's line of electronic and electrical 
power control components as furnished to end equipment manufacturers, 
working closely with Walter J& Brown, President and Director 
of Engineering of the recently acquired Sprague subsidiary. Mr& 
Brown will at the same time undertake expansion of VecTrol's custom 
design program for electronic control users with a greatly increased 
engineering staff.   Mr& Devey's new responsibilities are 
in addition to those of his present post as marketing manager of 
Sprague's Special Products Group, which manufactures a wide line 
of digital electronic components, packaged component assemblies, and 
high temperature magnet wires.   Mr& Devey first came to Sprague 
in 1953 as a Product Specialist in the Field Engineering Department, 
coming from the Office of Naval Research in Washington, D& 
C&, where he was an electronic scientist engaged in undersea warfare 
studies. During World War /2,, he was a lieutenant commander 
in the United States Navy. Mr& Devey is a graduate of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, and attended the United States 
Naval Academy Post-Graduate School specializing in electronic 
engineering. He was named Product Manager of the Special Products 
Division of Sprague when it was founded in 1958, and was later promoted 
to his present post. Mr& Devey is a member of the Institute 
of Radio Engineers, and is chairman of the Electronic Industries Association 
Committee ~P-9 on Printed and Modular Components.

Mr& Brown, well-known, English-born inventor, prior to founding 
VecTrol was at various times section leader in radio research at 
Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Co&, Ltd&; chief engineer 
of the radio set division of Electric and Musical Industries, Ltd&, 
the largest electronic equipment manufacturer in Great Britain; 
director of engineering at Philco of Great Britain, Ltd&, and 
vice president in charge of production and assistant to the president 
at The Brush Development Co&, Cleveland, Ohio. He has a Bachelor 
of Science from the University of Manchester, England. Mr& 
Brown presently has over 130 patents to his credit dating back to 1923. 
He is a fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, 
and a senior member of the Institute of Radio Engineers. He 
is a member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, London, a 
registered professional engineer in Connecticut and Ohio, and a chartered 
electrical engineer in Great Britain.

The promotion of Robert E& Swift to the position of Assistant 
Manager of the Interference Control Field Service Department 
was announced early in December by Frederick S& Scarborough, 
Manager of Interference Control Field Service. The appointment was 
made in a move to expand the engineering services offered to the designers 
of electronic systems through assistance in electro-magnetic compatability 
problems. 
Between meetings he helps the president keep track of delegated matters. 
Since these duties fit neatly with those of the proposed presidential 
aide, one person, with adequate staff assistance, could fill both 
jobs. ##

<Since faculty see themselves as self-employed professionals 
rather than as employees, enthusiasm in a common enterprise is 
proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of sharing 
in the decisions that govern its course>.   The faculty 
believes that broad autonomy is necessary to preserve its freedom in teaching 
and scholarship. The president expects faculty members to remember, 
in exercising their autonomy, that they share no collective responsibility 
for the university's income nor are they personally accountable 
for top-level decisions. He may welcome their appropriate participation 
in the determination of high policy, but he has a right to 
expect, in return, that they will leave administrative matters to the 
administration.   How well do faculty members govern themselves? 
There is little evidence that they are giving any systematic thought 
to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of their part in 
government. They sometimes pay more attention to their rights than 
to their own internal problems of government. They, too, need to learn 
to delegate. Letting the administration take details off their hands 
would give them more time to inform themselves about education as a 
whole, an area that would benefit by more faculty attention.   Although 
faculties insist on governing themselves, they grant little prestige 
to a member who actively participates in college or university 
government. There are, nevertheless, several things that the president 
can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those 
who are willing to exercise their privilege. He can, for example, 
present significant university-wide issues to the senate. He can encourage 
quality in faculty committee work in various ways: by seeing to 
it that the membership of each committee represents the thoughtful as 
well as the action-oriented faculty; by making certain that no faculty 
member has too many committee assignments; by assuring good liaison 
between the committees and the administration; by minimizing the 
number of committees.   Despite the many avenues for the exchange 
of ideas between faculty and administration, complaints of a lack 
of communication persist. The cause is as often neglect as hesitance 
to disclose. A busy president, conversant with a problem and its ramifications 
and beset by pressures to meet deadlines, tends naturally to 
assume that others must be as familiar with a problem as he is. The 
need for interchange and understanding makes vital the full use of all 
methods of consultation.   To increase faculty influence and decrease 
tension, many presidents have established a standing advisory 
committee with which they can discuss problems frankly.   The president 
has little influence in day-by-day curricular changes, but if 
he looks ahead two, three, or five years to anticipate issues and throw 
out challenging ideas, he can open the way for innovation, and he can 
also have a great deal to say as to what path it will take. Success 
will require tact, sensitivity to faculty prerogatives, patience, and 
persistence. ##

<The critical task for every president and his 
academic administrative staff is to assure that the college or university 
continually rebuilds and regenerates itself so that its performance 
will match changing social demands **h great professors do not automatically 
reproduce themselves>.   Deans can form an important bridge 
between the president and the faculty. They serve not only as spokesmen 
for their areas, but they also contribute to top-level decision 
making. The president who appoints strong men who have an all-college 
or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration 
can count on useful assistance.   Faculty members depend on
