first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional 
weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the 
picture too. The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion 
has hardly been compounded.   Ex-Presidents, relieved of accountability 
for policy, sometimes seem to feel free of accountability 
for their words. Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff 
discourses have been in that vein. Nobody can deny the right of former 
Chief Executives to take part in politics, but the American people 
expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership 
and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility. This is a matter 
of respect for the Presidency. Mr& Eisenhower's New York speech 
does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship. 

#QUEEN OF THE SEAS#

The Queen Mary has long been a symbol of 
speed, luxury, and impeccable British service on the high seas. Reports 
that the venerable liner, which has been in service since 1936, was 
to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us. But the Cunard 
line, influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment, has 
decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least.

A new queen, with the prosaic title of ~Q3, had been planned 
for several years to replace the Queen Mary. The British government, 
concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding 
industry, had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling 
$50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger 
liner.   Since 1957, more and more trans-Atlantic passengers 
have been crossing by air. Economy class fares and charter flights 
have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines. Competition 
from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers 
from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked 
drop of profits on the Atlantic run.   The Cunard line has 
under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 
75,000 tons. This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for 
cruises during the lean winter months. Also under consideration is 
an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to 
serve New York.   The decline of the Cunard line from its position 
of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development 
in the history of transportation. 

#MISSION TO VIET NAM#

Gen& Maxwell 
Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is "very much encouraged" 
about the chances of the pro-Western government of Viet Nam 
turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement 
that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to 
bolster the Vietnamese Army. Gen& Taylor will report to President 
Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet 
Nam and, judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East, 
he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese 
military, economic, political and other resources.   There was 
good reason for Gen& Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time. 
Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their 
activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a 
new crisis. South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year- more than 
300,000 tons- may have been destroyed. The Viet Cong, the Communist 
rebels, may have lost their stored grain and arms factories. 
The 
rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the 
floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.   Nothing that 
is likely to happen, however, should prompt the sending of United 
States soldiers for other than instructional missions. The Indochina 
struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954, when Gen& Ridgway 
estimated 
it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win 
a war the French were losing. It is a war to stay out of today, especially 
in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently 
does not want United States troops. He may want additional technical 
help, and this should be forthcoming. South Viet Nam has received 
$1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance 
has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B& Johnson's 
visit last May.   Gen& Taylor, the President's 
special military adviser, is a level-headed officer who is not likely 
to succumb to propaganda or pressure. It is probable that his recommendations 
will be informed and workable, and that they will not lead to 
involving the United States in an Asian morass.

Gov& John M& Dalton, himself a lawyer and a man of long 
service in government, spoke with rich background and experience when 
he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the 
Missouri General Assembly, or quit accepting fees from individuals 
and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the 
government and who are retained, not because of their legal talents, 
but because of their government influence. 

#THE U& N&'S 'GRAVEST CRISIS'#

Ambassador Stevenson yesterday 
described the U& N&'s problem of electing a temporary 
successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as "the gravest crisis the 
institution has faced". Of course it is. If the decision goes wrong, 
it may be- as Mr& Stevenson fears- "the first step on the 
slippery path downhill" to a U& N& without operational responsibilities 
and without effective meaning.   The integrity of the 
office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be, as 
the Charter puts it, "the chief administrative officer of the Organization", 
but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions 
from any government or any other authority "external to 
the Organization". In other words, the Secretary General is to be 
a nonpartisan, international servant, not a political, national one. 
He should be, as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was, a citizen of the 
world.   The Charter does stipulate that "due regard" shall 
be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on "as wide a geographical 
basis as possible". The United States and its allies have 
had no objection to this. What they have objected to is the attempt 
of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's 
death to turn the entire U& N& staff from the Secretary down 
into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.

The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic 
origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and, more particularly, 
around the nature of his relationship with them. Although 
the United States and the U& S& S& R& have been arguing 
whether there shall be four, five or six top assistants, the most important 
element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the 
manner in which these deputies are to do their work.   If any one 
of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions 
the nature of the organization will have changed. If they give him advice 
when he asks it, or if they perform specified duties under his direction, 
the nature of the U& N& will not of necessity change. 
The Secretary General must have, subject to the constitutional direction 
of the Security Council and the General Assembly, the power 
to act, to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled 
by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions.

This is the root issue for which the United States should stand. 
We should not become confused or let our public become confused over 
irrelevant questions of number or even of geography. What we must 
have, if the United Nations is to survive, is as nonpolitical, nonpartisan 
an organization at the top as human beings can make it, subject 
to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's 
ambition. 

#WHAT THE NEW CHARTER DOES#

The new City Charter, 
which should get a Yes vote as Question No& 1 on Nov& 7, would 
not make a good Mayor out of a bad one. There is no such magic 
in man-made laws. But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive 
powers, remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of 
inaction in the Board of Estimate, increase his budget-making authority 
both as to expense and capital budgets, and vest in him the right 
to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.

Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate 
and made 
a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor. Thus 
there is a clearer division of authority, administrative and legislative. 
The board is diminished in both respects, while it retains control 
over zoning, franchises, pier leases, sale, leasing and assignment 
of property, and other trusteeship functions. The board will be able 
to increase, decrease, add or eliminate budget items, subject to the 
Mayor's veto; but the City Council will now share fully this 
budget-altering power. Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes 
will require concurrence by board and Council, and a two-thirds vote.

The Controller retains his essential "fiscal watchdog" functions; 
his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed. 
He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties, which go to the Finance 
Department. On net balance, in spite of Controller Gerosa's 
opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office, the Controller 
will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government 
than he has now.   Borough Presidents, while retaining 
membership in the Board of Estimate, lose their housekeeping functions. 
Highways go to a new Department of Highways, sewers to the Department 
of Public Works, such street cleaning as Borough Presidents 
now do (in Queens and Richmond) to the Sanitation Department.

Some fiscal changes are important. The expense (operating) budget 
is to be a program budget, and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy 
(with the Mayor approving) in fund transfers within a department. 
The capital budget, for construction of permanent improvements, becomes 
an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises; 
but, as a second-look safeguard, each new project must undergo 
a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.

A road block to desirable local or borough improvements, heretofore 
dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on 
progress, is removed by making these a charge against the whole city 
instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected. This will 
have a beneficial effect by expediting public business; it will also 
correct some injustices.   Enlargement of the City Council 
and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow. 

#INTER-AMERICAN PRESS#

The Inter-american Press Association, 
which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape 
Horn, is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in 
eleven years. The I& A& P& A& is a reflection of the problems 
and hopes of the hemisphere; and in these days this inevitably 
means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution. 
As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime, 
more and more Cuban publishers, editors and correspondents were forced 
into exile. The I& A& P& A& found itself driven from journalism 
into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall 
of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the 
freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952.
