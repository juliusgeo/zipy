along its entire course, and there was a marked narrowing of the orifices 
of the large major visceral arteries. In particular, the orifices 
of the right renal and celiac arteries were virtually occluded, and 
both calcified common iliac arteries were completely occluded.

The lungs weighed together 950 gm&. On the surfaces of both lungs 
there were emphysematous blebs measuring up to 3 cm& in diameter. 
The parenchyma was slightly hyperemic in the apex of the left lung, 
and there were several firm, gray, fibrocalcific nodules measuring as 
large as 3 mm&. Microscopically, there was emphysema, fibrosis, and 
vascular congestion. Macrophages laden with brown pigment were seen 
in some of the alveoli, and the intima of some of the small arteries was 
thickened by fibrous tissue.   The firm red spleen weighed 410 
gm&, and its surface was mottled by discrete, small patches of white 
material. The endothelial cells lining the sinusoids were prominent, 
and many contained large quantities of hemosiderin. Some of the sinusoids 
contained large numbers of nucleated red cells, and cells of the 
granulocytic series were found in small numbers. There were slight 
fibrosis and marked arteriolosclerosis.   The liver weighed 2,090 
gm&, was brown in color, and the cut surface was mottled by irregular 
pale areas. Microscopically, there was hyperemia of the central veins, 
and there was some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma. Some liver cord 
cells contained vacuolated cytoplasm, while others had small amounts 
of brown hemosiderin pigment.   The gallbladder contained about 
40 cc& of green-brown bile and 3 smooth, dark-green calculi measuring 
up to 1 cm& in diameter.   The mucosa of the stomach was 
atrophic and irregularly blackened over a 14 cm& area. The small and 
large intestines were filled with gas, and the jejunum was dilated to 
about 2 times its normal circumference. The small intestine and colon 
contained approximately 300 cc& of foul-smelling, sanguineous material, 
and the mucosa throughout was hyperemic and mottled green-brown. 
A careful search failed to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric 
vessels. Microscopically, the mucosa of the stomach showed extensive 
cytolysis and contained large numbers of Gram-negative bacterial rods. 
The submucosa was focally infiltrated with neutrophils. The mucosa 
of the jejunum and ileum showed similar changes, and in some areas the 
submucosa was edematous and contained considerable numbers of neutrophils. 
Some of the small vessels were filled with fibrin thrombi, and 
there was extensive interstitial hemorrhage. A section of the colon 
revealed intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulcerations of the mucosa, 
associated with much fibrin and many neutrophils. Cultures taken 
from the jejunum yielded Monilia albicans, Pseudomonas pyocanea, Aerobacter 
aerogenes, and Streptococcus anhemolyticus.   The kidneys 
were pale and weighed right, 110 gm&, and left, 230 gm&. The 
surfaces were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear, fluid-filled 
cysts measuring up to 3 cm& in diameter. On the surface 
of the right kidney there were also 2 yellow, firm, friable raised areas 
measuring up to 2 cm& in diameter. Microscopically, both kidneys 
showed many small cortical scars in which there was glomerular and interstitial 
fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and an infiltration of lymphocytes 
and plasma cells. Occasional tubules contained hyaline casts admixed 
with neutrophils. Throughout, there were marked arteriolosclerosis 
and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles. These changes 
were more marked in the atrophic right kidney than in the left. In addition, 
there were 2 small papillary adenomas in the right kidney.

The bone of the vertebral bodies, ribs, and sternum was soft and 
was easily compressed. The marrow of the vertebral bodies was pale and 
showed areas of fatty replacement. Microscopically, there were many 
areas of hypercellularity alternating with areas of hypocellularity. 
The cells of the erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic series were normal 
except for their numbers. There was no evidence of fibrosis. The 
muscles of the extremities, chest wall, neck, and abdominal wall were 
soft, pale, and atrophic.   Microscopic studies of the gastrocnemius, 
pectoralis major, transversus abdominis, biceps brachii, and diaphragm 
showed atrophy as well as varying degrees of injury ranging from 
swelling and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers. 
These changes were most marked in the gastrocnemius and biceps and less 
evident in the pectoralis, diaphragm, and transversus.   In 
the 
gastrocnemius and biceps there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic 
fibers such as that shown in Figure 2. Such swollen fibers were 
deeply eosinophilic, contained a few pyknotic nuclei, and showed loss 
of cross-striations, obliteration of myofibrils, and prominent vacuolization. 
The necrosis often involved only a portion of the length of 
a given fiber, and usually the immediately adjacent fibers were normal. 
As shown in Figure 3, the protoplasm of other fibers was pale, granular, 
or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes. Inflammatory cells 
were strikingly absent. In association with these changes in the fibers, 
there were striking alterations in the muscle nuclei. These were 
increased both in number and in size, contained prominent nucleoli, 
and were distributed throughout the fiber (Figs& 2-5). In contrast 
to the nuclear changes described above, another change in muscle nuclei 
was seen, usually occurring in fibers that were somewhat smaller than 
normal but that showed distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae. 
The nuclei of these fibers, as is shown in Figures 3 and 4, showed remarkable 
proliferation and were closely approximated, forming a chainlike 
structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber. Individual 
nuclei were usually oval to round, though occasionally elongated, 
and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic. At times, clumps of 
10 to 15 closely-packed nuclei were also observed. Occasionally there 
were small basophilic fibers that were devoid of myofibrillae and contained 
many vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli (Fig& 5). These 
were thought to represent regenerating fibers. Trichrome stains failed 
to show fibrosis in the involved muscles. In all of the sections 
examined, the arterioles and small arteries were essentially normal. 
_PURIFICATION OF THE CONJUGATES_ In attempting to improve specificity 
of staining, the fluorescein-labeled antisera used in both direct 
and indirect methods were treated in one of several ways: (1) They 
were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone 
insoluble powders (Coons, 1958) prepared from mouse liver or from healthy 
sweet clover stems or crown gall tissue produced by <Agrobacterium 
tumefaciens> (E& F& Smith + Townsend) Conn, on sweet clover 
stems. 
(2) The conjugates as well as the intermediate sera were absorbed 
for 30 minutes with 20-50 ~mg of proteins extracted from healthy sweet 
clover stems. The proteins were extracted with 3 volumes of **f in 
**f to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitated by 80% saturation 
with **f. The precipitate was washed twice with an 80% saturated 
solution of **f, dissolved in a small quantity of 0.1 ~<M> neutral 
phosphate buffer, dialyzed against cold distilled water till free 
from ammonium ions, and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen. (3) In other 
experiments the indirect conjugate was treated with 3 volumes of 
ethyl acetate as recommended by Dineen and Ade (1957). (4) The conjugates 
were passed through a diethylaminoethyl (~DEAE-) cellulose 
column equilibrated with neutral phosphate buffer (~PBS) containing 
**f potassium phosphate and **f. _PREPARATION OF FROZEN SECTIONS_ 
The technique of cutting sections was essentially the same as that 
described by Coons <et al>& (1951). Root and stem tumors from 
sweet clover plants infected with ~WTV were quick-frozen in liquid 
nitrogen, embedded in ice, and cut at 3-6 ~|m in a cryostat maintained 
at -16` to -20`. The sections were mounted on cold slides 
smeared with Haupts' adhesive (Johansen, 1940) in earlier experiments, 
and in later experiments with a different mixture of the same components 
reported by Schramm and Ro^ttger (1959). The latter adhesive 
was found to be much more satisfactory. The sections were then 
thawed by placing a finger under the slide and dried under a fan for 
30 minutes; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks. _STAINING 
TECHNIQUE_ _INDIRECT METHOD._ The sections were fixed 
in 
acetone for 15 minutes and dried at 37` for 30 minutes. Some of them 
were then covered with a drop of **f in a moist chamber at 24` for 
30-40 minutes. As controls other sections were similarly covered with 
~NS. Sections were then washed with ~PBS for 15-30 minutes. 
After blotting out most of the saline around the sections, a drop 
of **f was layered over each of the sections, allowed to react for 30 
minutes, and then washed with ~PBS for 15-30 minutes. After blotting 
out most of the liquid around the sections, the latter were mounted 
in buffered glycerine (7 parts glycerine to 3 parts of ~PBS). 
_DIRECT METHOD._ After drying the sections under the fan, fixing 
in acetone, and drying at 37` as in the indirect method, the sections 
were treated with conjugated **f or **f (undiluted unless mentioned 
otherwise) for 5-30 minutes. As controls, other sections were similarly 
treated with **f or conjugated antiserum to the New York strain of 
potato yellow-dwarf virus (Wolcyrz and Black, 1956). The sections 
were then washed with ~PBS for 15-30 minutes and mounted in buffered 
glycerine. _FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY_ Stained or unstained sections 
were examined under dark field illumination in a Zeiss fluorescence 
microscope equipped with a mercury vapor lamp (Osram ~HBO 
200). The light beam from the lamp was filtered through a half-standard 
thickness Corning 1840 filter. In the eyepiece a Wratten 2 ~B 
filter was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light. A red filter, 
Zeiss barrier filter with the code (Schott) designation ~BG 
23, was also used in the ocular lens assembly as it improved the contrast 
between specific and nonspecific fluorescence. 

#RESULTS#

_SPECIFICITY 
OF STAINING_ _INDIRECT METHOD._ In the first few experiments 
**f was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed 
twice with 50-100 ~mg sweet clover tissue powder. The intermediate 
sera were also similarly absorbed with tissue powder. Sections of sweet 
clover stem and root tumors were treated with 1:10 solution of **f 
for 30 minutes, washed in buffered saline for 15 minutes, stained with 
**f for 30 minutes, and washed for 15 minutes in ~PBS. Such sections 
showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cells 
of the pseudophloem tissue (Lee and Black, 1955). This specific fluorescence 
was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence 
in consecutive sections stained with 1:10 dilution of ~NS 
and **f or with **f alone. Unstained sections mounted in buffered 
glycerine or sections treated only with ~NS or **f did not show 
such green fluorescence. Sections of crown gall tissue similarly stained 
with either **f and **f or ~NS and **f also showed only the light 
green nonspecific fluorescence. However, the nonspecific staining 
by the **f in tumor sections was considered bright enough to be confused 
with the staining of small amounts of ~WTV antigen. 
Two absorptions of **f with ethyl acetate or two absorptions of **f (which 
had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride), ~NS and **f with 
crown gall tissue powder, or mouse liver powder did not further improve 
the specificity of staining. Treatment of all the sera with sweet 
clover proteins greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence, especially when 
the treated conjugate was diluted to 1:2 with 0.85% saline. In 
all the above procedures, when the intermediate sera were diluted to 
1:10 or 1:100 with 0.85% saline, the specific and nonspecific fluorescence 
were not appreciably reduced, whereas, a dilution of the intermediate 
sera to 1:500 or diluting the **f to 1:5 greatly reduced 
specific fluorescence. Rinsing the sections with ~PBS before 
layering 
the intermediate sera did not improve the staining reaction. In addition 
to other treatments, treating the sections with normal sheep serum 
for half an hour before layering **f did not reduce nonspecific staining.

The only treatment by which nonspecific staining could 
be satisfactorily 
removed was by passing the conjugate through a ~DEAE-cellulose 
column. When 1 ~ml of conjugate was passed through a column 
(**f), the first and second milliliter fractions collected were the 
most 
specific and gave no nonspecific staining in some experiments, and
