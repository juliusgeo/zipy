of other friendly nations. If internal responsibility suggests acceptance 
of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility 
implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.

Reference to two other concepts- nationalism and sovereignty- 
may help to reveal the contours of the new principle. In its beginnings 
the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself- internally, 
against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence 
of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church. The breakup of 
the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more 
than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism. (Since the time-span 
of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence 
of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural 
for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest 
form of order, something permanent and unchanging.) The concept of 
nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies 
the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure. But 
it is more than that. For it includes the emotional ties that bind 
men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large 
group of people together as a unit. Today, as new nations rise from 
the former colonial empires, nationalism is one of the hurricane forces 
loose in the world. Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has 
become worldwide in application- unfortunately at the very time that 
nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm. Historically, however, 
the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the 
Western civilizational group. By subduing disparate lesser groups 
the nation has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual 
liberty. Within their confines, moreover, technological and 
industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing 
the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied. While the 
pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism 
has in fact served the Western peoples well. (Whether historical nationalism 
helped the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether 
today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial 
aspects, are other questions.)   It is one of the ironic quirks 
of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the 
territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that 
the nation-state attained its highest number (approximately 100). But 
it is more than irony: one of the main reasons why nationalism is 
no longer a tenable concept is <because> it has spread throughout the 
planet. In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had 
limited application, both as to geography and as to population; it 
becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.

Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal 
principle of sovereignty. The former receives its legitimacy from the 
latter. Operating side by side, together they helped shore up the nation-state. 
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present 
usage it is essentially modern. Jean Bodin, writing in the sixteenth 
century, may have been the seminal thinker, but it was the vastly influential 
John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now 
understood. Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty 
still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking. To 
him, law is the command of the sovereign (the English monarch) who 
personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to 
make law- i&e&, to prevail over internal groups and to be free 
from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations. These fundamental 
ideas- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual (internal-external) 
aspects- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate 
political power.   The nation-state, then, exemplifies the principle 
of nationalism and exercises sovereignty: supreme power over 
domestic affairs and independence from outside control. In fact, however, 
both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined. High-level 
abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision. 
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic 
societies, in which "popular" sovereignty is said to exist, 
and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split. Nevertheless, 
nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted 
wisdom, to describe the modern world. Is there a different reality behind 
the facade? Does the surface hide a quite different picture?

The short answer to those questions is "yes". Both concepts 
are undergoing alteration; to some degree they are being supplanted 
by a concept of national responsibility. As evidence to support 
that view, consider the following illustrative instances. 
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident? What steps have been 
taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the 
destruction of continents? Are we as safe as we should be from such 
a disaster? Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety? 
Will the danger increase or decrease?   I have just asked 
these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of 
key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl 
for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain 
Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as "Sherwood 
Forest". I asked the same questions inside the launch-control 
rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear 
sidearms are manning the "commit buttons" that could start a war- 
accidentally or by design- and in the command centers where other 
pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.   To 
the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments 
and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of 
tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched. 
There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate. 
"Readiness exercises" are almost continuous. Each could be the real 
thing.   In the command centers there are special clocks ready 
to tick off the minutes elapsed since "~E hour". "~E" 
stands for "execution"- the moment a "go order" would unleash 
an American nuclear strike. There is little time for the men in the 
command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks. 
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing 
colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business 
machines. They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical 
details. Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people 
who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so 
they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.   Among 
the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others 
charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their 
"hardware", the answers to my questions varied partly according to 
a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call "scenarios". 
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it: "You can't have 
dry runs on this one". The experts are thus forced to hypothesize 
sequences of events that have never occurred, probably never will- 
but possibly might. Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with 
these men: The more highly placed they are- that is, the more they 
know- the more concerned they have become.   Already accidental 
war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration 
about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions 
of national security. Only recently new "holes" were 
discovered in our safety measures, and a search is now on for more. Work 
is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed 
on all nuclear weapons.   Meanwhile, the experts speak of 
wars triggered by "false pre-emption", "escalation", "unauthorized 
behavior" and other terms that will be discussed in this report. 
They inhabit a secret world centered on "go codes" and "gold 
phones". Their conversations were, almost invariably, accompanied 
by the same gestures- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward 
each other in arclike semicircular motions. One arm represented our bombers 
and missiles, the other arm "theirs". Yet implicit in each 
movement was the death of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, perhaps 
you and me- and the experts.   These men are not callous. 
It is their job to think about the unthinkable. Unanimously they believe 
that the world would become a safer place if more of us- and more 
Russians and Communist Chinese, too- thought about accidental 
war.   The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box 
within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle, a 
frail, meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist. He was, and is, with the 
~RAND Corporation, a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the 
U& S& Air Force. His investigations made him the Paul Revere 
of accidental war, and safety procedures were enormously increased.

In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal 
by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy 
has been modified- and large new sums allocated- to meet the accidental-war 
danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.   The 
chain starts at ~BMEWS (Ballistic Missile Early Warning 
System) in Thule, Greenland. Its radar screens would register Soviet 
missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States. 
~BMEWS intelligence is simultaneously flashed to ~NORAD 
(North American Air Defense Command) in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado, for interpretation; to the ~SAC command and control 
post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near 
Omaha, Nebraska; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.   Telephones, 
Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems and, in some cases, television, 
link all vital points. Alternate locations exist for all key command 
centers. For last-ditch emergencies ~SAC has alternate command 
posts on ~KC-135 jet tankers. Multiple circuits, routings and 
frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.   The 
same principle of "redundancy" applies to all communications on these 
special networks. And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits 
until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special 
codes, 
that the messages actually come from their purported sources. Additional 
codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.

Only the President is permitted to authorize the 
use of nuclear weapons. That's the law. But what if somebody decides 
to break it? The President cannot personally remove the safety 
devices from every nuclear trigger. He makes the momentous decision. 
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers 
and to push the buttons. What if one or more of them turn irrational 
or suddenly, coolly, decide to clobber the Russians? What if the President 
himself, in the language of the military, "goes ape"? 
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets 
without provocation?   Nobody can be absolutely certain of 
the answers. However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully, 
so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.   Even 
the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a "go" order. 
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike- the 
"go code". In an emergency he would receive available intelligence 
on the "gold-phone circuit". A system of "gold"- actually 
yellow- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of 
the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the ~SAC 
commander and other key men. All can be connected with the gold circuit 
from their homes. All could help the President make his decision. 
The talk would not be in code, but neither would it ramble. Vital 
questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda. 
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured 
me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the 
gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from ~BMEWS.

If communications work, his decision would be instantly known 
in all command posts that would originate the actual go order. For 
these centers, too, are on the gold circuit. They include the Navy's 
Atlantic Command at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with 
the Polaris subs; ~NATO headquarters in Europe; Air Force 
forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific, which control 
tactical fighters on ships and land bases; and ~SAC, which controls 
long-range bombers and Atlas missiles.   Let us look in on 
one of these nerve centers- ~SAC at Omaha- and see what must
