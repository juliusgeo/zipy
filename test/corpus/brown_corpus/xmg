**f. We know that in the ~<C>-plane both ~<C> and **f are analytic. 
In the ~<C>-plane we construct a set of rectangular Cartesian 
coordinates ~<u>, ~<v> with the origin at ~<Q> and 
such that both ~<C> and **f have finite slope at ~<Q>. Near 
~<Q>, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of 
~<u>. 
In a neighborhood of ~<Q> the difference between these 
functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of ~<u>. Furthermore, 
one can find a neighborhood of ~<Q> in which the difference 
function is monotone, for since it is analytic it can have only 
a finite number of extrema in any interval. Now, to find **f, one needs 
the intersection of ~<C> and **f near ~<Q>. But **f is just 
the curve **f translated without rotation through a small arc, for 
**f is always obtained by rotating ~<C> through exactly 90`. The 
arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve. Thus if ~<e> is 
sufficiently 
small, there can be only one intersection of ~<C> and 
**f near ~<Q>, for if there were more than one intersection for every 
~<e> then the difference between ~<C> and **f near ~<Q> 
would not be a monotone function. Therefore, **f is single-valued 
near ~<Q>. It is also seen that **f, since the change from **f 
to **f is accomplished by a continuous translation. Thus **f is also 
continuous at **f, and in a neighborhood of **f which does not contain 
a tangent point.   We turn now to the set of tangent points on 
the graph. This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals. 
The fact that there can not be any limit points of the set except 
in closed intervals follows from the argument used in Lemma 1, namely, 
that near any tangent point in the ~<C>-plane the curves ~<C> 
and **f are analytic, and therefore the difference between them 
must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the 
tangent point. This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence 
of isolated tangent points. 

#LEMMA 2.#

<In some neighborhood of 
an 
isolated tangent point in the ~f-plane, say **f, the function **f is 
either double-valued or has no values defined, except at the tangent 
point itself, where it is single-valued>. _PROOF._ A tangent point 
~<Q> in the ~<C>-plane occurs when ~<C> and **f are 
tangent to one another. A continuous change in ~<t> through an amount 
~<e> results in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve 
**f. There are three possibilities: (a) **f remains tangent to 
~<C> as it is translated; (b) **f moves away from ~<C> and 
does not intersect it at all for **f; (c) **f cuts across ~<C> 
and there are two ordinary intersections for every ~<t> in **f. The 
first possibility results in a closed interval of tangent points 
in the ~<f>-plane, the end points of which fall into category (b) 
or (c). In the second category the function **f has no values defined 
in a neighborhood **f. In the third category the function is double-valued 
in this interval. The same remarks apply to an interval on the 
other side of **f. Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantee 
that such intervals exist. In the neighborhood of an end point of an 
interval of tangent points in the ~<f>-plane the function is two-valued 
or no-valued on one side, and is a single-valued function consisting 
entirely of tangent points on the other side.   With the 
above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of ~<f>. 
First, for any value of ~<t> for which all values of ~<f(t)> 
are ordinary points the number of values of ~<f(t)> must be 
odd. For it is clear that the total number of ordinary intersections 
of ~<C> and **f must be even (otherwise, starting in the interior 
of ~<C>, **f could not finally return to the interior), and the 
center of rotation at ~<t> is the argument of the function, not a 
value. Therefore, for any value of ~<t> the number of values of 
~<f(t)> is equal to the (finite) number of tangent points corresponding 
to the argument ~<t> plus an odd number. 

#DEFINITION.#

The 
number of ordinary values of the function ~<f(t)> at ~<t> 
will be called its multiplicity at ~<t>. 

#LEMMA 3.#

<The graph 
of ~f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval 
~[0,<T>]. _PROOF_ We suppose not. Then every component 
of the graph of ~<f> must be defined over a bounded sub-interval. 
Suppose **f is defined in the sub-interval **f. Now **f and **f 
must both be tangent points on the ~<n>th component in the ~<f>-plane; 
otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond 
these points. Further, we see by Lemma 2 that the multiplicity of 
~<f> can only change at a tangent point, and at such a point can 
only change by an even integer. Thus the multiplicity of **f for a given 
~<t> must be an even number. This is true of all components 
which have such a bounded support. But this is a contradiction, for we 
know that the multiplicity of ~<f(t)> is odd for every ~<t>.

We have shown that the graph of ~<f> contains at least one 
component whose inverse is the entire interval ~[0,<T>], and 
whose multiplicity is odd. There must be an odd number of such components, 
which will be called complete components. The remaining (incomplete) 
components all have an even number of ordinary points at any argument, 
and are defined only on a proper 
sub-interval of ~[0,<T>].

We must now show that on some component of the graph there exist 
two points for which the corresponding diagonal points in the ~<C>-plane 
are on opposite sides of ~<C>. We again consider a 
fixed point ~<P> at **f and a variable point ~<Q> at **f on 
~<C>. We erect a square with ~<PQ> as a side and with free 
corners **f and **f adjacent to ~<P> and ~<Q> respectively. 
As ~<s> varies from zero to ~<T>, the values of ~<s> for 
which **f and **f <cross> ~<C> will be denoted by **f and **f 
respectively. We have **f, plus tangent points. These ~<s>-values 
are just the ordinary values of **f. 

#LEMMA 4.#

<The values **f 
are the ordinary values at **f of a multi-valued function ~<g(t)> 
which has components corresponding to those of ~<f(t)>. _PROOF._ 
We first define a function ~<b(t)> as follows: given the 
set of squares such that each has three corners on ~<C> and vertex 
at ~<t>, ~<b(t)> is the corresponding set of positive parametric 
differences between ~<t> and the <backward> corner points. 
The functions ~<f> and ~<b> have exactly the same multiplicity 
at every argument ~<t>. Now with ~<P> fixed at **f, **f-values 
occur when the corner **f crosses ~<C>, and are among the values 
of ~<s> such that **f. The roots of this equation are just the 
ordinates of the intersections of the graph of ~<b> with a straight 
line of unit slope through **f in the ~<b>-plane (the plane of 
the graph of ~<b>). We define these values as **f, and define ~<g(t)> 
in the same way for each ~<t>. Thus we obtain ~<g(t)> 
by introducing an oblique ~<g(t)>-axis in the ~<b>-plane. 

#INTRODUCTION.#

In @1 we investigate a new series of line involutions 
in a projective space of three dimensions over the field of complex 
numbers. These are defined by a simple involutorial transformation 
of the points in which a general line meets a nonsingular quadric surface 
bearing a curve of symbol **f. Then in @2 we show that any line 
involution with the properties that (a) It has no complex of invariant 
lines, and (b) Its singular lines form a complex consisting exclusively 
of the lines which meet a twisted curve, is necessarily of the 
type discussed in @1. No generalization of these results to spaces 
of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible. 

#1.# 

Let ~<Q> be a nonsingular quadric surface bearing reguli **f 
and **f, and let ~\g be a **f curve of order ~<k> on ~<Q>. 
A 
general line ~<l> meets ~<Q> in two points, **f and **f, through 
each of which passes a unique generator of the regulus, **f, whose 
lines are simple secants of ~\g. On these generators let **f and 
**f be, respectively, the harmonic conjugates of **f and **f with respect 
to the two points in which the corresponding generator meets ~\g. 
The line **f is the image of ~<l>. Clearly, the transformation 
is involutorial.   We observe first that no line, ~<l>, 
can meet its image except at one of its intersections with ~<Q>. 
For if it did, the plane of ~<l> and ~<l'> would contain 
two generators of **f, which is impossible. Moreover, from the definitive 
transformation of intercepts on the generators of **f, it is clear 
that the only points of ~<Q> at which a line can meets its image 
are the points of ~\g. Hence the totality of singular lines is 
the ~<k>th order complex of lines which meet ~\g.   The 
invariant lines are the lines of the congruence of secants of ~\g, 
since each of these meets ~<Q> in two points which are invariant. 
The order of this congruence is **f, since **f secants of a curve of 
symbol ~(<a,b>) on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point. 
The class of the congruence is **f, since an arbitrary plane meets 
~\g in ~<k> points.   Since the complex of singular 
lines is of order ~<k> and since there is no complex of invariant 
lines, it follows from the formula **f that the order of the involution 
is **f.   There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines 
whose images are not unique. The most obvious of these is the quadratic 
complex of tangents to ~<Q>, each line of which is transformed 
into the entire pencil of lines tangent to ~<Q> at the image 
of the point of tangency of the given line. Thus pencils of 
tangents to ~<Q> are transformed into pencils of tangents. It is 
interesting that a 1:1 correspondence can be established between the 
lines of two such pencils, so that in a sense a unique image can actually 
be assigned to each tangent. For the lines of any plane, ~|p, 
meeting ~<Q> in a conic ~<C>, are transformed into the congruence 
of secants of the curve ~<C'> into which ~<C> is 
transformed in the point involution on ~<Q>. In particular, tangents 
to ~<C> are transformed into tangents to ~<C'>. Moreover, 
if **f and **f are two planes intersecting in a line ~<l>, tangent 
to ~<Q> at a point ~<P>, the two free intersections of 
the image curves **f and **f must coincide at ~<P'>, the image 
of ~<P>, and at this point **f and **f must have a common tangent 
~<l'>. Hence, thought of as a line in a particular plane ~|p, 
any tangent to ~<Q> has a unique image and moreover this image 
is the same for all planes through ~<l>.   Each generator, 
~|l, of **f is also exceptional, for each is transformed into the 
entire congruence of secants of the curve into which that generator 
is transformed by the point involution on ~<Q>. This curve is of 
symbol **f since it meets ~|l, and hence every line of **f in the 
**f invariant points on ~|l and since it obviously meets every line 
of **f in a single point. The congruence of its secants is therefore 
of order **f and class **f.   A final class of exceptional lines 
is identifiable from the following considerations: Since no two 
generators of **f can intersect, it follows that their image curves 
can have no free intersections. In other words, these curves have only 
fixed intersections common to them all. Now the only way in which all 
curves of the image family of **f can pass through a fixed point is
