truth of my statement, but could not think of anything that might evoke 
responses more quickly.   "It is easy for you to talk"; 
countered a twenty year old law student, "you travel around the world. 
We would like to do that too".   "But you want a job guaranteed 
when you return", I continued my attack. "You must have 
some security", said a young clerk.   When I mentioned that 
for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return 
fare, but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount, 
the young people looked at me doubtingly. One girl expressed what was 
obviously in their minds.   "Would you advise us to act the 
same way? You might have failed. I think it is rather foolhardy to 
trust to luck".   Others mentioned that I might have had to 
ask 
friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign 
country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international 
understanding.   The debate needed no additional controversy 
and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life, what 
his hopes were and what his fears.   Though the four boys and 
two girls, the youngest nineteen years of age, the oldest twenty-four, 
came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal 
interests, there was surprising agreement among them. What they 
wished for most was security; what they feared most was war or political 
instability in their own country.   The ideal home, they 
agreed, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to 
five rooms, just enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and 
two children. No one wanted a larger family or no children, and none 
hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would 
be satisfactory.   All expressed interest in world affairs 
but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.

ONCE again, as in the days of the Founding Fathers, America 
faces a stern test. That test, as President Kennedy forthrightly 
depicted it in his State of the Union message, will determine "whether 
a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure".

It is well then that in this hour both of "national peril" 
and of "national opportunity" we can take counsel with the men who 
made the nation. Incapable of self-delusion, the Founding Fathers 
found the crisis of their time to be equally grave, and yet they had 
confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free 
peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.

Seven Founders- George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, 
John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James 
Madison and John Jay- determined the destinies of the new nation. 
In certain respects, their task was incomparably greater than ours today, 
for there was nobody before them to show them the way. As Madison 
commented to Jefferson in 1789, "We are in a wilderness without 
a single footstep to guide us. Our successors will have an easier task".

They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words, 
as "the Argonauts" who had lived in "the Heroic Age". Accordingly, 
they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential 
sources for posterity. Their writings assume more than dramatic or 
patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in 
which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but, rather, 
as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen, 
that "with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved".

Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point 
of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven were essentially 
congenial minds, and their agreements with each other were more consequential 
than their differences. Even though in most cases the completion 
of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off, 
enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing 
a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual 
feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.

Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember 
that their separate careers were extraordinary. Certainly no other 
seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in 
so concentrated a span of years.   Eldest of the seven, Benjamin 
Franklin, a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the 
most dazzling success story in our history. The young printer's apprentice 
achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields, as editor 
and publisher, scientist, inventor, philanthropist and statesman. 
Author of the Albany Plan of Union, which, had it been adopted, might 
have avoided the Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line 
battles in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and 
the peace that ended the war, headed the state government of Pennsylvania, 
and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal 
Convention. ##

ON a military mission for his native Virginia 
the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian 
War, then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia. 
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution, 
he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory. Retiring 
to his beloved Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal 
Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected 
President. During his two terms the Constitution was tested and 
found workable, strong national policies were inaugurated, and the 
traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed. 
John Adams fashioned much of pre-Revolutionary radical ideology, wrote 
the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts, negotiated, 
with Franklin and Jay, the peace with Britain and served as our first 
Vice President and our second President. ##

HIS political 
opponent and lifetime friend, Thomas Jefferson, achieved immortality 
through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, but 
equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted 
in his native Virginia, his role as father of our territorial system, 
and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first 
term as President.   During the greater part of Jefferson's 
career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian, James 
Madison, eight years his junior. The active sponsor of Jefferson's 
measure for religious liberty in Virginia, Madison played the most 
influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in 
securing its ratification in Virginia, founded the first political 
party in American history, and, as Jefferson's Secretary of State 
and his successor in the Presidency, guided the nation through the 
troubled years of our second war with Britain.   If Franklin was 
an authentic genius, then Alexander Hamilton, with his exceptional 
precocity, consuming energy, and high ambition, was a political prodigy. 
His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was only 19, quickly 
brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders. Principal author 
of "The Federalist", he swung New York over from opposition 
to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly. His 
collaboration with Washington, begun when he was the general's aide 
during the Revolution, was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet 
as Secretary of the Treasury. His bold fiscal program and his broad 
interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions. 
##

LESS dazzling than Hamilton, less eloquent than Jefferson, 
John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers. 
He served as president of the Continental Congress. He played 
the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that 
ended the Revolution, and directed America's foreign affairs throughout 
the Confederation period. As first Chief Justice, his strong 
nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall. He ended his public 
career as a two-term governor of New York.   These Seven Founders 
constituted an intellectual and social elite, the most respectable 
and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed. Their 
social status was achieved in some cases by birth, as with Washington, 
Jefferson and Jay; in others by business and professional acumen, 
as with Franklin and Adams, or, in Hamilton's case, by an influential 
marriage. Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals 
in underdeveloped nations of our own day, they commanded both prestige 
and influence before the Revolution started.   As different 
physically as the tall, angular Jefferson was from the chubby, rotund 
Adams, the seven were striking individualists. Ardent, opinionated, 
even obstinate, they were amazingly articulate, wrote their own copy, 
and were masters of phrasemaking. ##

CAPABLE of enduring friendships, 
they were also stout controversialists, who could write with 
a drop of vitriol on their pens. John Adams dismissed John Dickinson, 
who voted against the Declaration of Independence, as "a certain 
great fortune and piddling genius". Washington castigated his 
critic, General Conway, as being capable of "all the meanness of intrigue 
to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity". And 
Hamilton, who felt it "a religious duty" to oppose Aaron Burr's 
political ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk had 
he shown more literary restraint.   The Seven Founders were 
completely dedicated to the public service. Madison once remarked: 
"My life has been so much a public one", a comment which fits the 
careers of the other six. Franklin retired from editing and publishing 
at the age of 42, and for the next forty-two years devoted himself 
to public, scientific, and philanthropic interests. Washington never 
had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved 
best, plantation management. He served as Commander in Chief during 
the Revolution without compensation. ##

JOHN ADAMS took 
to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley, 
to "pursue the study of the law, rather than the gain of it". In 
taking account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded 
that "no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did" 
and "for so little profit". When the Revolution broke out, he, along 
with Jefferson and Jay, abandoned his career at the bar, with considerable 
financial sacrifice.   Hamilton, poorest of the seven, 
gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet. 
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of 
the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends. 
"If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars", he wrote 
one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury.   To 
support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell 
of public service. Talleyrand passed his New York law office one 
night on the way to a party. Hamilton was bent over his desk, drafting 
a legal paper by the light of a candle. The Frenchman was astonished. 
"I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune 
of his country, but now is working all night in order to support his 
family", he reflected. ##

ALL seven combined ardent devotion 
to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality. John 
Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of 
Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their 
charters, the British Constitution and the common law, and Jefferson 
appealed in the Declaration of Independence "to the tribunal of 
the world" for support of a revolution justified by "the laws of 
nature and of nature's God".   They fought hard, but they were 
forgiving to former foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures 
from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 
1783.   This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified 
in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee, 
Peter Van Schaack. Jay had participated in the decision that exiled
