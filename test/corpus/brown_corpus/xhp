consequences of this continue to affect the area. In certain 
respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South. 
Poor where they had once been rich, humbled where they had been 
arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the 
nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from 
the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country. And 
no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia, which 
were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century, bitterly 
regretted the revolt against the Crown.   Among Bourbons 
the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed 
than other factors. All Southerners agree that slavery had to 
go; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling 
it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did. Southern 
resentment has been over the method of its ending, the invasion, 
and Reconstruction; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro 
political control in many counties. But apart from racial problems, 
the old unreconstructed South- to use the moderate words favored by 
Mr& Thomas Griffith- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what 
is different about the civilization of the North. And this, in effect, 
means most of modern America.   It is hard to see how the 
situation could be otherwise. And therein, I feel, many Northerners 
delude themselves about the South. For one thing, this is not a subject 
often discussed or analyzed. There seems to be almost a conspiracy 
of silence veiling it. I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful 
thinking: don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and 
they will take care of themselves. Or else the North really believes 
that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come 
around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers 
of the American Dream, like everybody else.   If the circumstances 
are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be 
true. The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western 
world. Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area 
appropriate to a pre-World-War-/1, great power have been, following 
conquest, 
ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had 
imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike. And the 
great majority of these people are of Anglo-Saxon or Celtic descent. 
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic 
origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign 
domination. The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot 
and cold. In every war of the United States since the Civil War 
the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country. So instead 
of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the 
two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances 
and cement reunion. And there is no section of the nation more 
ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism. Had the 
situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 
1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is 
little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put 
on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain. It 
is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners 
should have been as docile as they have. The North should thank its 
stars that such has been the case; but at the same time it should not 
draw false inferences therefrom.   The two main charges levelled 
against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social 
reactionaries. There is much truth in both these charges, and not 
many Bourbons deny them. Whatever their faults, they are not hypocrites. 
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon is the best 
race in the world and that it should remain pure. Many Northeners 
believe this, too, but few of them will say so publicly. The Bourbon 
economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern 
conservatives. But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed 
go much further than this. They believe that if the South 
had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that 
of modern America. As it is, they consider that the North is now 
reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high 
standard of living the "American way" has been proved inferior 
to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the 
socialistic features of the latter.   The South's antipathy 
to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh 
accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy 
and the use of leisure. Their own easier, slower tempo is especially 
dear to Southerners; and I have heard many say that they are content 
to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because 
they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.

In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry Maine noted 
long ago, were only two in number: internal order and external security. 
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men, 
the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order 
within its territorial borders. Outside those limits it asserted, as 
against other states, a position of sovereign equality, and, as against 
the "inferior" peoples of the non-Western world, a position of 
dominance. It became the sole "subject" of "international law" 
(a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham), 
a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western 
nations could do in the world arena. (That corpus of law was a 
reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. Speaking generally, it furthered- and still 
tends to further- the interests of the Western powers. The enormous 
changes in world politics have, however, thrown it into confusion, so 
much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in 
need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions 
of the present era.)   Beyond the two basic tasks mentioned 
above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state 
responsibility, either internally or externally. This was particularly 
true in the world arena, which was an anarchical battleground characterized 
by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires. 
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have 
astonished a nineteenth-century statesman. His duty was to his sovereign 
and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial 
boundaries was not to be contemplated. Thus, to cite but one 
example, the <Pax Britannica> of the nineteenth century, whether with 
the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling 
world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other 
nations (e&g&, the United States) may have incidentally benefited. 
At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal 
responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial 
state was strongly resisted. Social Darwinism was able to stave 
off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.

However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are multiple 
reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has 
occurred in both facets of national activity. A concept of responsibility 
is in process of articulation and establishment. Already firmly 
implanted internally, it is a growing factor in external matters.

A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned 
an important corner. In what has aptly been called a "constitutional 
revolution", the basic nature of government was transformed from 
one essentially negative in nature (the "night-watchman state") to 
one with affirmative duties to perform. The "positive state" came 
into existence. For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences, 
there has been a special fascination since then in the role 
played by the Supreme Court in that transformation- the manner in 
which its decisions altered in "the switch in time that saved nine", 
President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious "Court-packing 
plan", the imprimatur of judicial approval that was 
finally placed upon social legislation. Of greater importance, however, 
is the content of those programs, which have had and are having enormous 
consequences for the American people. Labor relations have been 
transformed, income security has become a standardized feature of political 
platforms, and all the many facets of the American version of 
the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom. A national 
consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts 
are desirable as well as necessary. Ratified in the Republican Party 
victory in 1952, the Positive State is now evidenced by political 
campaigns being waged not on <whether> but on <how much> social 
legislation there should be.   The general acceptance of the idea 
of governmental (i&e&, societal) responsibility for the economic 
well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant 
watersheds in American constitutional history. The other, of 
course, was the Civil War, the conflict which a century ago insured 
national unity over fragmentation. A third, one of at least equal and 
perhaps even greater importance, is now being traversed: American 
immersion and involvement in world affairs.   Internal national 
responsibility, now a truism, need not be documented. Nevertheless, 
it may be helpful to cite one example- that of employment- for, as 
will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept. Thirty 
years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression, 
the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow 
"natural forces" to operate and cure the distress. That guiding 
principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the 
New Deal; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the 
Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the 
responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment. 
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through 
planning- the economic side of the constitutional revolution. In 
1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration 
came when the principle of <national> responsibility for <local> 
economic distress won out over a "state's-responsibility" 
proposal- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief 
by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted 
with manpower surplus. The American people have indeed come 
a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.   Internal 
national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the 
Industrial Revolution. Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption 
of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals 
to cope with the rigors of the era. National responsibility for 
individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or 
even to the Western nations. A measure of its widespread acceptance 
may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists 
in 1959. Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International 
Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world, 
the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law 
to include affirmative governmental duties. It is noteworthy that 
the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed, 
former colonial nations. The Rule of Law, historically a principle 
according everyone his "day in court" before an impartial tribunal, 
was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of 
government to promote individual welfare. Recognizing that the Rule 
of Law is "a dynamic concept **h which should be employed not only 
to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free 
society", the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility 
"to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions 
under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized". 
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common 
feature of the nations of the non-Soviet world. For better or for worse, 
we all now live in welfare states, the organizing principle of which 
is collective responsibility for individual well-being.   Whether 
a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility 
operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more 
difficult to establish. The hypothesis ventured here is that it does, 
and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition. The content 
is not the same, however: rather than individual security, it 
is the security and continuing existence of an "ideological group"- 
those in the "free world"- that is basic. External national 
responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of 
the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability
