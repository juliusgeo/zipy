it. White teeth suddenly vanishing, the driver slammed the side of 
his bottle against Johnson's ear.   We were off the road, gleaming 
barbed wire pulling taut. I ducked just as the first strand broke 
somewhere down the line and came whipping over the sideboards. We 
were in a field, in a tight, screeching turn. Prairie dogs were popping 
up and popping down. When I fell on my back, I saw a vulture hovering.

Just as I got to my knees, there was again the sound 
of the fence stretching, and I had time only to start taking my kneeling 
posture seriously. This time no wire came whipping into the truck.

We were back on the road. I regained my squatting position 
behind the truck cab's rear window. Johnson's left hand was pressed 
against the side of his head, red cheeks whitening beneath his fingers.

"Tee-wah", the driver cackled, his black eyes glittering 
behind dull silver chicken fencing. "That was Tee-wah I was 
talking. You thought I was a Mexican, didn't you, buddy"?

I nodded.   "Hell, that's all right, buddy", the Indian 
(I now guessed) said. "Drink your beer".   Miraculously, 
the bottle was still in my hand, foam still geysering over my (luckily) 
waterproof watch. No sooner had I started drinking than the driver 
started zigzagging the truck. The beer foamed furiously. I drank 
furiously. A long time. Emptied the bottle.   Teeth again flashing 
back at me, the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which "amigo" 
appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves of 
surrounding sound. I bobbed my head each time it appeared.   Suddenly 
the Spanish became an English in which only one word emerged 
with clarity and precision, "son of a bitch", sometimes hyphenated 
by vicious jabs of a beer bottle into Johnson's quivering ribs.

A big car was approaching, its chrome teeth grinning. Beyond 
it the gray road stretched a long, long way. The car was just about to 
us, its driver's fat, solemn face intent on the road ahead, on business, 
on a family in Sante Fe- on anything but an old pick-up truck 
in which two human beings desperately needed rescue.   I tossed 
the bottle. High, so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off 
the car's steel roof. Too high. On unoccupied roadway the bottle 
shattered into a small amber flash.   "Aye-yah-ah-ah"!

The Indian was again raising his bottle, but to my astonished relief- 
probably only a fraction of Johnson's- the bottle this time 
went to the Indian's lips.   Another car was coming, a tiny, 
dark shape on a far hill. I started looking on the splintery truck 
bed for a piece of board, a dirt clod- anything I could throw and 
with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle.   We were slowing. 
In the ditch sand was white and soft-looking, only an occasional 
pebble discernible, faintly gleaming. But Johnson couldn't quickly 
unwire the truck door, and if I escaped, he might suffer. 
The car was approaching fast. On the truck bed there was nothing smaller 
than a piece of rusty machinery; with more time I could have 
loosened a small burr or cotter pin-   Suddenly and not a second 
too soon I thought of the coins in my pocket. There was no time to 
pick out a penny; I got a coin between my thumb and forefinger, leaned 
my elbows in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck 
cab and flipped my little missile.   There was a blur just under 
my focus of vision, a crash; the car's far windshield panel turned 
into a silver web with a dark hole in the center.   I heard 
the screech of brakes behind me, an insane burst of laughter beneath me. 
Looking back I saw a gray-haired man getting out of his halted car 
and trying to read our license number.   "S-s-sahjunt". Johnson's 
fat hand, another bottle were protruding from the truck cab, 
and that self-proclaimed Baptist teetotaler, had a bottle at his own 
lips.   Two cars came over a crest, their chrome and glass flashing. 
The Indian's arm whipped sidewise- there was a flash of amber 
and froth, the crash of the bottle shattering against the side of 
the first car.   Brakes shrieked behind us. I saw Johnson's 
bottle snatched from his hand, saw it go in a swirl of foam just behind 
the second car. This time there was no sound of brakes but the shrieking 
of women. I looked back at pale ovals framed in the elongated 
oval of the car's rear window.   "Drink, you son of a bitch"! 
I quickly turned around and began to drink. But the Indian was 
jabbing another bottle toward Johnson.

I guided her to the divan, turned off the ~TV, faced her. 
She sat quietly, staring at me from the wide eyes. And what eyes they 
were. Big and dark, a melting, golden brown. Eyes like hot honey, 
eyes that sizzled. Plus flawless skin, smooth brow and cheeks, lips that 
looked as if you could get a shock from them. It was a disturbingly 
familiar face, too, but I couldn't remember where we had met.

I said, "Do we know each other, Miss"?   "No, I 
remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here, and 
when it happened all I could think of was"- This time she stopped 
the rush of words herself. "I'm sorry. Shall I go on"? 
She smiled. It was her first smile. But worth waiting for. 
"Sure". I said. "But one word at a time, O&K&"? She 
was 
still hugging the stained coat around her, so I said, "Relax, let 
me take your things. Would you like a drink, or coffee"? 
"No, thanks". She stood up, pulled the coat from her shoulders and 
started to slide it off, then let out a high-pitched scream and I 
let out a low-pitched, wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out. She 
was wearing nothing beneath the coat. She jerked the coat back on and 
squeezed it around her again, but not soon enough. There had been a 
good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out, and 
now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before. ##

"I forgot"! 
she yelped. "Oh, do forgive me. I'm sorry"! 
"I forgive"-   "That's what started all the trouble in 
the first place. Oh, dear, I'm all unstrung".   "You and 
me both, dear. Haven't we **h haven't I seen you **h. I mean, 
surely we've"-   "You may have seen me on ~TV", 
she said. "I've done several filmed commercials for"- 
Then it hit me. "ZING"! I cried.   "Why, yes. And 
you recognized me"?   "Yes, indeed. In fact, I was watching 
you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell. 
Man, you rang- it was in color, too, Miss, and **h Miss? What's 
your name, anyway? Ah, you were splendid". I sat by her on 
the divan. "Splendid. In a waterfall **h and all that".   "That's 
the last one we did. That was a fun one".   "I'll 
bet. It was fun for me, all right. I don't mean to pry, but do 
they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles? I mean: Is advertising 
honest?   "It depends on who does it. I never wear anything 
at all. It wouldn't- wouldn't seem fair, somehow". 
"I couldn't agree with you more".   "I really do have something 
important to tell you, Mr& Scott. About the murder".

"Murder? Oh, yeah", I said. "Tell me about the murder".

She told me. ZING was the creation of two men, Louis 
Thor and Bill Blake, partners in ZING!, Inc&. They'd 
peddled the soap virtually alone, and without much success, until 
about a year ago, when- with the addition of "~SX-21" to their 
secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising 
campaign- sales had soared practically into orbit. Their product had 
been endorsed by <Good Housekeeping,> the A&M&A&, and the 
<Veterinary Journal>, among other repositories of higher wisdom, 
and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in 
the john, even your best friends would think you didn't bathe.

My lovely caller- Joyce Holland was her name- had previously 
done three filmed commercials for ZING, and this evening, the fourth, 
a super production, had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor. 
The water in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket 
of thick, foamy soapsuds- fashioned, of course, from ZING- 
Joyce had dived from the board into the pool, then swirled and cavorted 
in her luxurious "bath" while cameras rolled. The finished- 
and drastically cut- product would begin with a hazy longshot of 
Joyce entering the suds, then bursting above the pool's surface clad 
in layers of lavender lather, and I had a hunch this item was going 
to sell tons and tons of soap; even to clean men and boys. 
Joyce went on, "When we'd finished, Lou- Mr& Thor- asked 
me to stay a little longer. He wanted a few stills for magazine ads, 
he said. Everybody left and I stayed in the pool, then Lou came 
back alone and leaped into the pool too. And he didn't have any clothes 
on".   "He didn't"!   "Yes, he didn't. 
Did, I mean". She paused. "<Did> leap into the pool, and <didn't> 
have anything on. Anyway, it was evident what he had in mind".

"You got away, didn't you"?   "Yes. He 
caught up with me once and grabbed me, but I was all covered with ZING- 
it's very slippery, you know".   "I didn't know. 
I wouldn't have the stuff in the house. But I'm pleased to 
hear"-   "So I just scooted out of his clutches. I swam 
like mad, got out of the pool, grabbed my robe, and ran to the car. The 
keys were still in it, and I was miles away before I remembered 
that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana 
where I'd changed".   She'd driven around for a while, 
Joyce said, then, thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that 
time, she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive, parked 
in front, and walked toward the pool. While several yards from it, still 
concealed by the shrubbery, she'd seen two men on her left at the 
pool's edge. She went on:   "A man was holding onto Lou, 
holding him up. Maybe Lou was only unconscious, but right then I 
thought he must be dead. The man shoved him into the water, then ran 
past the cabana. There's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive. 
I was so scared **h well, I just ran to my car and came here".

"You know who the other man was"?   "No, I never 
did see his face. I didn't get a good look at him at all, his back 
was to me, and I was so scared **h It was just somebody in a man's 
suit. But I'm sure the other one was Lou".   What Joyce 
wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and "do whatever detectives 
do", and get her clothes- and handbag containing her identification. 
She realized I'd have to notify the police, but fervently 
hoped I could avoid mentioning her name.   Her impact in the 
ZING commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent 
part in an upcoming ~TV series, <Underwater Western Eye,> a 
documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits. But if Joyce 
got involved in murder or salacious scandal, the role would probably 
go to the sponsor's wife, Mrs& Oatnut Grits. Or at least not 
to Joyce.   "And I so want the part", she said. "The 
commercials have just been for money, there hasn't been any real incentive 
for me to do them, but in <Underwater Western Eye> I'd 
have a chance to <act>. I could show what I can <do>". ## 

As far as I was concerned, she had already and had dandily shown what 
she could do. But I promised Joyce I would mention her name, if 
at all, only as a last resort. Seeming much relieved, she smiled one 
of those worth-waiting-for smiles, and I smiled all the way into the 
bedroom. There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness, slipped 
my coat on, and went back into the front room.   Joyce squirmed 
a little on the divan. "I'm starting to itch", she said.

"Itch"?   "Yes, I'm still all covered with that 
soap. I was loaded with suds when I ran away, and I haven't had a 
chance to wash it off. Mmmm, it sure itches".   "You might
