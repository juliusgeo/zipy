both the rake angle of the knife as well as the friction 
occurring between the back of the removed coating and the front of the 
knife will determine in large part the detailed mechanism of the cutting 
removal process.   It is difficult to measure the direction 
and magnitude of ~<R> directly. In actual practice, the values most 
readily amenable to measurement are the cutting force **f and the 
shear angle ~|f. These two values and the rake angle ~|a are 
sufficient to determine the other parameters of these relationships. 
~|a is defined by the geometry of the knife; ~|f can readily 
be determined by measuring the thickness of the coating before and after 
cutting from the substrate; **f is instrumentally determined. From 
Fig& 6 the relationship between these parameters can readily be 
derived and the cutting force is **f where ~|l is the shear strength 
of the coating and is a parameter of the coatings material, ~<w> 
is the width of the removed coating and ~<t> is its thickness.

If the cutting force, **f is plotted against film thickness, 
a straight line should result passing through the origin and having slope 
**f. However, in the actual assessment of the cutting force by instrumental 
methods for any thickness of coating a number of spurious effects 
occur which must be taken into account and which make the measured 
value larger than the true cutting force indicated by eqn& (1). 

#BLUNT KNIFE#

One of these is the fact that the knife employed, no 
matter how well sharpened, will have a slightly rounded cutting edge. 
This signifies that ~|a, the rake angle, is no longer a constant 
to zero film thickness. The curvature of this bluntness is, in the 
case of the Carboloy knife employed in the Hesiometer, determined by 
the grain sizes of the polished grit and the tungsten carbide crystals 
cemented together in the knife body and is in the order of 0.1 to 0.2 
mil&.   The force vector concept of Fig& 6 can readily be 
applied to this condition also. Because the rake angle **f at the tip 
of the knife is very much smaller (or even negative) when compared 
to the value of ~|a for the major portion of the knife, a very rapid 
increase in cutting force with thickness will result. This reduces 
to the relationship: **f where **f is the intercept at zero thickness 
of the extrapolation of the slope indicated in eqn& (1), **f is the 
thickness of the coating equivalent to the rounding off of the knife 
tip, **f is a straight line first approximation of this roundness, and 
the other symbols are equivalent to those of eqn& (1). It can be 
seen that **f is a constant, and is determined for the most part by the 
geometry of the knife. The blunter the knife, the higher is the value 
of **f. The importance of a hard, abrasion resistant knife material 
like the Carboloy employed in the Hesiometer immediately becomes 
apparent. Softer knives would blunt very rapidly, making the value of 
**f inexact. In extreme cases of very soft knives this value may even 
change during the course of a measurement. 

#KNIFE FRICTION#

A second 
factor which enters into the practical measurement of the instrumentally 
determined cutting force is the frictional resistance caused 
by the bottom of the knife against the substrate. This is not a constant 
value like **f, but varies with the thickness of the coating and the 
direction and magnitude of the resultants ~<R> and **f of Fig& 
6. Under equilibrium conditions of cutting the chip exerts a thrust 
**f against the knife which tends to push it into the substrate or 
lift it away from the substrate depending on the vector direction of **f. 
The resultant friction force, **f is thus directly proportional to 
**f and consequently also to film thickness.   The value of **f 
can readily be assessed by determining the frictional force exerted 
on the knife while running over the previously stripped coating track 
under various external loadings. A straight line relationship is usually 
observed in a plot of **f against load ~<L>, having slope ~<k>, 
and **f Since the load ~<L>, under actual cutting conditions 
is caused by **f, it can be seen that **f   The measured force, 
~<H>, in cutting removal of coatings from their substrates consequently 
can be seen to be the sum of that force required to cut the 
coating, **f that due to the bluntness of the knife, **f, and that due 
to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate, **f, 
or **f The first two forces are directly interrelated and depend 
upon film thickness, whereas **f is independent of these two and is a 
constant for a given knife/coating combination.   These theoretical 
relationships are more clearly illustrated in Fig& 7 and their 
sum can be seen to correlate in form with practical measurements made 
with the Hesiometer as illustrated in the first portion of Fig& 5 
for the cutting mechanism. 

#CHIPPING MECHANISM OF COHESIVE FAILURE# 

Although a large number of coatings systems, 
particularly at low thicknesses fail cohesively by the cutting mechanism, 
frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place. 
This is a chipping, dynamic type failure encountered with very brittle 
coatings resins or very highly pigmented films. This is shown in 
the photomicrograph of Fig& 8.   The basic difference between 
the continuous cutting mechanism and that of the chipping mechanism 
is that instead of shear occurring in the coating ahead of the knife continuously 
without fracture, rupture intermittently occurs along the 
shear plane. The detailed mechanisms of this type of failure have been 
studied extensively by MERCHANT for metal cutting, and the principles 
found can be directly applied to coatings.   By studying 
high speed movies made of this type of failure, the sequence of relationships 
as schematically illustrated in Fig& 9 could be observed.

In the first picture (9~a) the knife is just beginning to advance 
into the inclined surface which was left from the previous chip 
formation. In the next, the shear plane angle is high, and extends to 
the inclined work surface. With increasing advance of the knife into 
the coating the shear plane extends to the coatings surface and the shear 
angle rapidly decreases. Eventually, rupture occurs along the shear 
plane (9~e), and the cycle repeats itself.   MERCHANT 
has found that the same basic relationships which describe the geometry 
and force systems in the case of the cutting mechanism can also be 
applied to the discontinuous chip formation provided the proper values 
of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional 
area are used. Consequently, if the shear angle ~|f 
is replaced by the rupture angle **f, the relationships as described in 
eqns& (1), (2), (4), and (6) will directly apply. 

#THE CRACKING 
MECHANISM#

Under equilibrium cutting conditions, the chip exerts a 
force **f against the coating and an equal opposite force **f against 
the knife in the plane of the substrate as shown in Fig& 6. If the 
rake angle ~|a of the knife is high enough and the friction angle 
~|t between the front of the knife and the back of the chip is low 
enough to give a positive value for **f, the resultant vector ~<R> 
will lie above the plane of the substrate.

Within only a few years, foamed plastics materials have managed 
to grow into an integral, and important, phase of the plastics industry- 
and the end is still not yet in sight. Urethane foam, as only 
one example, was only introduced commercially in this country in 1955. 
Yet last year's volume probably topped 100 million lb& and expectations 
are for a market of 275 million lb& by 1964. Many of the other 
foamed plastics, particularly the styrenes, show similar growth potential. 
And there are even newer foamed plastics that are yet to be 
evaluated. As this issue goes to press, for example, one manufacturer 
has announced an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength; 
another reports that a cellular polypropylene, primarily for use 
in wire coating applications, is being investigated.   On the 
following pages, each of the major commercial foamed plastics is described 
in detail, as to properties, applications, and methods of processing.

It might be well to point out, however, some of the newer 
developments that have taken place within the past few months which 
might have a bearing on the future of the various foamed plastics involved. 
In urethane foams, for example, there has been a definite trend 
toward the polyether-type materials (which are now available in two-component 
rigid foam systems) and the emphasis is definitely on one-shot 
molding. Most manufacturers also seem to be concentrating on formulating 
fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grades of urethane foam that 
are aimed specifically at the burgeoning building markets. Urethane 
foam as an insulator is also coming in for a good deal of attention. 
In one outstanding example, Whirlpool Corp& found that by switching 
to urethane foam insulation, they could increase the storage capacity 
of gas refrigerators to make them competitive with electric models. 
Much interest has also been expressed in new techniques for processing 
the urethane foams, including spraying, frothing, and molding (see 
article, p& 391 for details). And in meeting the demands for urethane 
foam as a garment interlining, new adhesives and new methods of laminating 
foam to a substrate have been developed.   New techniques 
for automatic molding of expandable styrene beads have helped boost 
that particular material into a number of new consumer applications, including 
picnic chests, beverage coolers, flower pots, and flotation-type 
swimming toys. Two other end-use areas which contributed to expandable 
styrene's growth during the year were packaging (molded inserts 
replacing complicated cardboard units) and foamed-core building panels. 
Extruded expandable styrene film or sheet- claimed to be competitive 
price-wise with paper- also showed much potential, particularly 
for packaging. Sandwich panels for building utility shelters that 
consist of kraft paper skins and rigid styrene foam cores also aroused 
interest in the construction field.   In vinyl foam, the big news 
was the development of techniques for coating fabrics with the material 
(for details, see P& 395). Better "hand", a more luxurious 
feel, and better insulating properties were claimed to be the result. 
Several companies also saw possibilities in using the technique for 
extruding or molding vinyl products with a slight cellular core that 
would reduce costs yet would not affect physical properties of the end 
product to any great extent.   Readers interested in additional 
information on foams are referred to the Foamed Plastics Chart appearing 
in the Technical Data section and to the list of references which 
appears below. 

#URETHANE FOAMS#

@ Since the mid 1950s, when 
urethane foam first made its appearance in the American market, growth 
has been little short of fantastic. Present estimates are that production 
topped the 100-million-lb& mark in 1960 (85 to 90 million 
lb& for flexible, 10 or 11 million lb& for rigid); by 1965, production 
may range from 200 to 350 million lb& for flexible and from 115 
to 150 million lb& for rigid. The markets that have started to open 
up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectations. 
Furniture upholstery, as just one example, can easily take millions 
of pounds; foamed refrigerator insulation is under intensive evaluation 
by every major manufacturer; and use of the foam for garment 
interlining is only now getting off the ground, with volume potential 
in the offing. _BASIC CHEMISTRY_ Urethane foams are, basically, 
reaction products of hydroxyl-rich materials and polyisocyanates (usually 
tolylene diisocyanate). Blowing can be either one of two types- 
carbon dioxide gas generated by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate 
or mechanical blowing through the use of a low-boiling liquid 
such as a fluorinated hydrocarbon.   The most important factor 
in determining what properties the end-product will have is quite naturally
