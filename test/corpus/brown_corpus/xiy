a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the Protestant 
Succession. At the order of the Dowager Electress, the Hanoverian 
agents, supported by the Whig leaders, demanded that a writ 
of summons be issued which would call the Duke to England to sit in 
Parliament, thus further insuring the Succession by establishing a Hanoverian 
Prince in England before the Queen's death. Anne was 
furious, and Bolingbroke advised that the request be refused. Oxford, 
realizing that the law required the issuance of the writ, took the opposite 
view, for which the Queen never forgave him. Accordingly the 
request was granted, but the Elector himself, who had not been consulted 
by his mother, rejected the proposal and recalled his agent Schu^tz, 
whose impolitic handling of the affair had caused the Hanoverian 
interest to suffer and had made Oxford's dismissal more likely 
than ever. Steele in this paper is indicating his sympathy for such a 
plan. A few days after this <Englishman> appeared, Defoe reported 
to Oxford that Steele was expected to move in Parliament that the 
Duke be called over; Defoe then commented, "If they Could Draw 
that young Gentleman into Their Measures They would show themselves 
quickly, for they are not asham'd to Say They want Onely a head 
to Make a beginning".   The final issue of the <Englishman,> 
No& 57 for February 15, ran to some length and was printed 
as a separate pamphlet, entitled <The Englishman: Being the Close 
of the Paper So-called>. Steele's purpose is to present a general 
defense of his political writing and a resume of the themes which 
had occupied him in the <Englishman;> but there is much here also 
which bears directly on his personal quarrel with Swift. Thus he complains, 
with considerable justice, that the Tory writers have resorted 
to libel instead of answering his arguments. His birth, education, 
and fortune, he says, have all been ridiculed simply because he has 
spoken with the freedom of an Englishman, and he assures the reader that 
"whoever talks with me, is speaking to a Gentleman born". As 
notable examples of this abuse, he quotes passages from the <Examiner,> 
"that Destroyer of all things", and <The Character of Richard 
Steele,> which he here attributes to Swift. Though put in rather 
maudlin terms, Steele's defense of himself has a reasonable basis. 
His point is simply that the Tories have showered him with personal 
satire, despite the fact that as a private subject he has a right 
to speak on political matters without affronting the prerogative of 
the Sovereign. He claims, too, that his political convictions are simply 
those which are called "Revolution Principles" and which are 
accepted by moderate men in both parties.   The final section 
of this pamphlet is of special interest in a consideration of Steele's 
relations with Swift. It purports to be a letter from Steele to 
a friend at court, who, in Miss Blanchard's opinion, could only be 
meant as Swift. Steele first answers briefly the charges which his 
"dear old Friend" has made about his pamphlet on Dunkirk and 
his 
<Crisis>. Then he launches into an attack on the Tory ministers, 
whom he calls the "New Converts"; by this term he means to ridicule 
their professions of acting in the interest of the Church despite 
their own education and manner of life- a gibe, in other words, 
at the "Presbyterianism" in Harley's family and at Bolingbroke's 
reputed impiety. The Tory leaders, he insinuates, are cynically 
using the Church as a political "By-word" to increase party friction 
and keep themselves in power. This is the principal point made 
in this final section of <Englishman> No& 57, and it caps Steele's 
efforts in his other writing of these months to counteract the 
notion of the Tories as a "Church Party" supported by the body 
of the clergy.   Next, Steele turns his attention to the "Courtier" 
he is addressing. He explains that there are sometimes honorable 
courtiers, but that too often a man who succeeds at court does not 
hesitate to sacrifice his Sovereign and nation to his own avarice 
and ambition. Such, he implies, is the case with his friend, who is not 
really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new converts. 
If "Jack the Courtier" is really to be taken as Swift, the following 
remark is obviously Steele's comment on Swift's change of 
parties and its effect on their friendship: "I assure you, dear 
<Jack,> when I first found out such an Allay in you, as makes you 
of so malleable a Constitution, that you may be worked into any Form 
an Artificer pleases, I foresaw I should not enjoy your Favour much 
longer". He closes his "letter" by demanding that Dunkirk 
be demolished, that the Pretender be forced to move farther away from 
the coast of England, and that the Queen and the House of Hanover 
come to a better understanding. The last point was soon to be included 
in the "seditious" remarks used against him in Parliament.

The <Examiner,> during Steele's trial a month later, printed 
an answer from the "courtier" addressed to "R& S&" at 
Button's coffee-house. He reviews Steele's entrance into politics 
and finds that his present difficulties are due to his habit of attributing 
to his own abilities and talents achievements which more properly 
should be credited to the indulgence of his friends. Once more, 
in other words, Steele is said to be indebted to Swift for his "wit"; 
this was the form in which their private feud most often appeared 
in the Tory press, especially the <Examiner>. In <The Publick 
Spirit of the Whigs,> it may be noted, Swift himself contemptuously 
dismissed Steele's reference to his friend at court: "I 
suppose by the Style of <old Friend,> and the like, it must be some 
Body <there> of his own Level; among whom, his Party have indeed 
more <Friends> than I could wish".   On February 16, 
Steele took his seat in Parliament. By now he was undergoing a fresh 
torrent of abuse from Tory papers and pamphlets, and action was being 
taken to effect his punishment by expulsion from Parliament. On the 
very day that the parliamentary session began, another "Infamous 
Libel" appeared, entitled <A Letter from the Facetious Dr& 
Andrew Tripe, at Bath, to the Venerable Nestor Ironside>. It is 
filled with the usual personal abuse of Steele, especially of his physical 
appearance; in the opening paragraph, too, Steele is accused 
of extreme egotism, of giving "himself the preference to all the learned, 
his contemporaries, from Dr& Sw-ft himself, even down to 
Poet Cr-spe of the Customhouse". 
When Harold Arlen returned to California in the winter of 1944, it 
was to take up again a collaboration with Johnny Mercer, begun some 
years before. The film they did after his return was an inconsequential 
bit of nothing titled <Out of This World,> a satire on the Sinatra 
bobby-soxer craze. The twist lay in using Bing Crosby's voice 
on the sound track while leading man Eddie Bracken mouthed the 
words. If nothing else, at least two good songs came out of the project, 
"Out of This World" and "June Comes Around Every Year".

Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting 
songs, Arlen and Mercer were not given strong material to work on. 
Their first collaboration came close. Early in 1941 they were assigned 
to a script titled <Hot Nocturne>. It purported to be a reasonably 
serious attempt at a treatment of jazz musicians, their aims, their 
problems- the tug-of-war between the "pure" and the "commercial"- 
and seemed a promising vehicle, for the two men shared a 
common interest in jazz.   Johnny Mercer practically grew up with 
the sound of jazz and the blues in his ears. He was born in Savannah, 
Georgia, in 1909. His father, George A& Mercer, was descended 
from an honored Southern family that could trace its ancestry back 
to one Hugh Mercer, who had emigrated from Scotland in 1747.

The lyricist's father was a lawyer who had branched out into 
real estate. His second wife, Lillian, was the mother of John H& 
Mercer. By the age of six young Johnny indicated that he had the 
call. One day he followed the Irish Jasper Greens, the town band, 
to a picnic and spent the entire day listening, while his family spent 
the day looking. The disappearance caused his family to assign a full-time 
maid to keeping an eye on the boy. But one afternoon Mrs& 
Mercer met her; both were obviously on the way to the Mercer home. 
The mother inquired, "Where's Johnny, and why did you leave him"? 
"There was nothing else I could do", the maid answered, 
satisfied with a rather vague explanation. But Mrs& Mercer demanded 
more. The maid then told her, "Because he fired me".   With 
her son evidencing so strong a musical bent his mother could do little 
else but get him started on the study of music- though she waited 
until he was ten- beginning with the piano and following that with 
the trumpet. Young Mercer showed a remarkable lack of aptitude for 
both instruments. Still, he did like music making and even sang in 
the chapel choir of the Woodberry Forest School, near Orange, Virginia, 
where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well. 
When he was fifteen John H& Mercer turned out his first song, a 
jazzy little thing he called "Sister Susie, Strut Your 
Stuff". 
If his scholarship and formal musicianship were not all they might have 
been, Mercer demonstrated at an early age that he was gifted with 
a remarkable ear for rhythm and dialect. From his playmates in Savannah, 
Mercer had picked up, along with a soft Southern dialect, traces 
also of the Gullah dialects of Africa. Such speech differences 
made him acutely aware of the richness and expressivness of language.

During the summers, while he was still in school, Mercer worked 
for his father's firm as a messenger boy. It generally took well 
into the autumn for the firm to recover from the summer's help. "We'd 
give him things to deliver, letters, checks, deeds and things 
like that", remembers his half-brother Walter, still in the real estate 
business in Savannah, "and learn days later that he'd absent-mindedly 
stuffed them into his pocket. There they stayed". 
This rather detached attitude toward life's encumbrances has seemed 
to be the dominant trait in Mercer's personality ever since. It 
is, however, a disarming disguise, or perhaps a shield, for not only has 
Mercer proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists over the 
years, but also one who can function remarkably under pressure. He 
has also enjoyed a successful career as an entertainer (his records have 
sold in the millions) and is a sharp businessman.   He has also 
an extraordinary conscience. In 1927 his father's business collapsed, 
and, rather than go bankrupt, Mercer senior turned his firm over 
to a bank for liquidation. He died before he could completely pay off 
his debts. Some years later the bank handling the Mercer liquidation 
received a check for $300,000, enough to clear up the debt. The check 
had been mailed from Chicago, the envelope bore no return address, 
and the check was not signed.   "That's Johnny", sighed 
the bank president, "the best-hearted boy in the world, but absent-minded". 
But Mercer's explanation was simple: "I made out 
the check and carried it around a few days unsigned- in case I lost 
it". When he remembered that he might have not signed the check, 
Mercer made out another for the same amount, instructing the bank to 
destroy the other- especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly 
signed both of them.   When the family business failed, Mercer 
left school and on his mother's urging- for she hoped that he 
would become an actor- he joined a local little theater group. When 
the troupe traveled to New York to participate in a one-act-play competition- 
and won- Mercer, instead of returning with the rest of 
the company in triumph, remained in New York. He had talked one other 
member of the group to stay with him, but that friend had tired of 
not eating regularly and returned to Savannah. But Mercer hung on, 
living, after a fashion, in a Greenwich Village fourth-flight walk-up. 
"The place had no sink or washbasin, only a bathtub", his mother 
discovered when she visited him. "Johnny insisted on cooking a 
chicken dinner in my honor- he's always been a good cook- and I'll 
never forget him cleaning the chicken in the tub".   A story, 
no doubt apocryphal, for Mercer himself denies it, has him sporting 
a monacle in those Village days. Though merely clear glass, it 
was a distinctive trade mark for an aspiring actor who hoped to imprint 
himself upon the memories of producers. One day in a bar, so the legend 
goes, someone put a beer stein with too much force on the monacle 
and broke it. The innocent malfeasant, filled with that supreme sense 
of honor found in bars, insisted upon replacing the destroyed monacle- 
and did, over the protests of the former owner- with a square monacle.
