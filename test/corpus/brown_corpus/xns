or to be about to do so- while the rest of the subject remains 
imbedded in, or flat upon, the surface. And the surface is driven back, 
in its very surfaceness, only by this contrast.   In the upper 
center of Braque's first collage, <Fruit Dish> (in Douglas 
Cooper's collection), a bunch of grapes is rendered with such conventionally 
vivid sculptural effect as to lift it practically off the picture 
plane. The <trompe-l'oeil> illusion here is no longer enclosed 
between parallel flatnesses, but seems to thrust through the surface 
of the drawing paper and establish depth <on top> of it. Yet the 
violent immediacy of the wallpaper strips pasted to the paper, and the 
only lesser immediacy of block capitals that simulate window lettering, 
manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture 
plane so that it does not "jump". At the same time, the wallpaper 
strips themselves seem to be pushed into depth by the lines and 
patches of shading charcoaled upon them, and by their placing in relation 
to the block capitals; and these capitals seem in turn to be pushed 
back by <their> placing, and by contrast with the corporeality 
of the woodgraining. Thus every part and plane of the picture keeps 
changing place in relative depth with every other part and plane; and 
it is as if the only stable relation left among the different parts 
of the picture is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with 
the surface. And the same thing, more or less, can be said of the contents 
of Picasso's first collage.   In later collages of both 
masters, a variety of extraneous materials are used, sometimes in the 
same work, and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving 
and eye-undeceiving device they can think of. The area adjacent 
to one edge of a piece of affixed material- or simply of a painted-in 
form- will be shaded to pry that edge away from the surface, while 
something will be drawn, painted or even pasted over another part of 
the same shape to drive it back into depth. Planes defined as parallel 
to the surface also cut through it into real space, and a depth is 
suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially. 
All this expands the oscillation between surface and depth so as to 
encompass fictive space in front of the surface as well as behind it. 
Flatness may now monopolize everything, but it is a flatness become 
so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion itself- at least 
an optical if not, properly speaking, a pictorial illusion. Depicted, 
Cubist flatness is now almost completely assimilated to the literal, 
undepicted kind, but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms 
the undepicted kind- and it does so, moreover, without depriving 
the latter of its literalness; rather, it underpins and reinforces 
that literalness, re-creates it. ##

Out of this re-created literalness, 
the Cubist subject reemerged. For it had turned out, by a 
further paradox of Cubism, that the means to an illusion of depth and 
plasticity had now become widely divergent from the means of representation 
or imaging. In the Analytical phase of their Cubism, Braque 
and Picasso had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply 
in order to preserve it; they had also had to <generalize> it- 
to the point, finally, where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted 
from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely 
as the illusion of depth and relief <as such:> as a disembodied 
attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself. 
In order to be saved, plasticity had had to be isolated; and 
as the aspect of the subject 
was transposed into those clusters of more or less interchangeable 
and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity 
was isolated under the Cubist method, the subject itself became largely 
unrecognizable. Cubism, in its 1911-1912 phase (which the French, 
with justice, call "hermetic") was on the verge of abstract art.

It was then that Picasso and Braque were confronted with 
a unique dilemma: they had to choose <between> illusion and representation. 
If they opted for illusion, it could only be illusion per se- 
an illusion of depth, and of relief, so general and abstracted as 
to exclude the representation of individual objects. If, on the other 
hand, they opted for representation, it had to be representation per 
se- representation as image pure and simple, without connotations (at 
least, without more than schematic ones) of the three-dimensional space 
in which the objects represented originally existed. It was the 
collage that made the terms of this dilemma clear: the representational 
could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface 
now that illusion and representation had become, for the first time, 
mutually exclusive alternatives.   In the end, Picasso and Braque 
plumped for the representational, and it would seem they did so 
deliberately. (This provides whatever real justification there is for 
the talk about "reality".) But the inner, formal logic of Cubism, 
as it worked itself out through the collage, had just as much to do 
with shaping their decision. When the smaller facet-planes of Analytical 
Cubism were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large, dense shapes 
formed by the affixed materials of the collage, they had to coalesce- 
become "synthesized"- into larger planar shapes themselves 
simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane. Left 
in their previous atom-like smallness, they would have cut away too abruptly 
into depth; and the broad, opaque shapes of pasted paper would 
have been isolated in such a way as to make them jump out of plane. 
Large planes juxtaposed with other large planes tend to assert themselves 
as <independent> shapes, and to the extent that they are flat, 
they also assert themselves as silhouettes; and independent silhouettes 
are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours of the subject 
from which a picture starts (if it does start from a subject). It was 
because of this chain-reaction as much as for any other reason- that 
is, because of the growing independence of the planar unit in collage 
as a <shape>- that the identity of depicted objects, or at least 
parts of them, re-emerged in Braque's and Picasso's <papiers colles> 
and continued to remain more conspicuous there- but only as 
flattened silhouettes- than in any of their paintings done wholly in 
oil before the end of 1913.   Analytical Cubism came to an end 
in the collage, but not conclusively; nor did Synthetic Cubism fully 
begin there. Only when the collage had been exhaustively translated 
into oil, and transformed by this translation, did Cubism become 
an affair of positive color and flat, interlocking silhouettes whose legibility 
and placement created allusions to, if not the illusion of, 
unmistakable three-dimensional identities.   Synthetic Cubism began 
with Picasso alone, late in 1913 or early in 1914; this was the 
point at which he finally took the lead in Cubist innovation away from 
Braque, never again to relinquish it. But even before that, Picasso 
had glimpsed and entered, for a moment, a certain revolutionary path 
in which no one had preceded him. It was as though, in that instant, 
he had felt the flatness of collage as too constricting and had suddenly 
tried to escape all the way back- or forward- to literal three-dimensionality. 
This he did by using utterly literal means to carry 
the forward push of the collage (and of Cubism in general) <literally> 
into the literal space in front of the picture plane.   Some 
time in 1912, Picasso cut out and folded a piece of paper in the 
shape of a guitar; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper 
and four taut strings, thus creating a sequence of flat surfaces in real 
and sculptural space to which there clung only the vestige of a picture 
plane. The affixed elements of collage were extruded, as it were, 
and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief. 
(Los Angeles in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper.) And without 
high density in the core, rapid-transit systems cannot be maintained 
economically, let alone built from scratch at today's prices. 
However, the building of freeways and garages cannot continue forever. 
The new interchange among the four Los Angeles freeways, including 
the grade-constructed accesses, occupies by itself no less than <eighty 
acres> of downtown land, one-eighth of a square mile, an area 
about the size of Rockefeller Center in New York. It is hard to believe 
that this mass of intertwined concrete constitutes what the law 
calls "the highest and best use" of centrally located urban land. 
As it affects the city's fiscal situation, such an interchange is 
ruinous; it removes forever from the tax rolls property which should 
be taxed to pay for the city services. Subways improved land values 
without taking away land; freeways boost valuation less (because the 
garages they require are not prime buildings by a long shot), and reduce 
the acreage that can be taxed. Downtown Los Angeles is already 
two-thirds freeway, interchange, street, parking lot and garage- one 
of those preposterous "if" statistics has already come to pass.

The freeway with narrowly spaced interchanges concentrates and 
mitigates the access problem, but it also acts inevitably as an artificial, 
isolating boundary. City planners do not always use this boundary 
as effectively as they might. Less ambitious freeway plans may be 
more successful- especially when the roadways and interchanges are 
raised, allowing for cross access at many points and providing parking 
areas below the ramp. ##

Meanwhile, the automobile and its friend 
the truck have cost the central city some of its industrial dominance. 
In ever greater numbers, factories are locating in the suburbs or 
in "industrial parks" removed from the city's political jurisdiction. 
The appeal of the suburb is particularly strong for heavy industry, 
which must move bulky objects along a lengthy assembly line and wants 
enough land area to do the entire job on one floor. To light industry, 
the economies of being on one floor are much slighter, but efficiency 
engineers usually believe in them, and manufacturers looking for 
ways to cut costs cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers.

This movement of industry away from the central cities 
is not so catastrophically new as some prophets seem to believe. It 
is merely the latest example of the leapfrog growth which formed the pattern 
of virtually all American cities. The big factories which are 
relatively near the centers of our cities- the rubber factories in 
Akron, Chrysler's Detroit plants, U&S&Steel's Pittsburgh 
works- often began on these sites at a time when <that> was the 
edge of the city, yet close to transport (river), storage (piers) and 
power (river). The "leapfrog" was a phenomenon of the railroad and 
the steam turbine, and the time when the belts of residence surrounding 
the old factory area were not yet blighted.   The truck and 
the car gave the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in selecting his 
plant site. Until internal combustion became cheap, he had to be near 
a railroad siding and a trolley line or an existing large community 
of lower-class homes. The railroad siding is still important- it 
is usually, though not always, true that long-haul shipment by rail is 
cheaper than trucking. But anybody who promises a substantial volume 
of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to his plant these 
days, and many businesses can live without the railroad. And there 
are now many millions of workers for whom the factory with the big parking 
lot, which can be reached by driving across or against the usual 
pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus lines, is actually 
more convenient than the walk-to factory.   Willow Run, General 
Electric's enormous installations at Louisville and Syracuse, the 
Pentagon, Boeing in Seattle, Douglas and Lockheed in Los Angeles, 
the new automobile assembly plants everywhere- none of these is 
substantially served by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit. 
They are all suburban plants, relying on the roads to keep them supplied 
with workers. And wherever the new thruways go up their banks are 
lined by neat glass and metal and colored brick light industry. The 
drive along Massachusetts' Route 128, the by-pass which makes an 
arc about twenty miles from downtown Boston, may be a vision of the future.

The future could be worse. The plants along Route 128 
are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England rocks 
and trees. They can even be rather grand, like Edward Land's monument 
to the astonishing success of Polaroid. But they deny the values 
of the city- the crowded, competitive, tolerant city, the "melting 
pot" which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities. 
They are segregated businesses, combining again on one site 
the factory and the office, drawing their work force from segregated
