as if admitting to a crime.   "The snake was beautiful, wasn't 
it"? asked Keith, his voice getting harsher in spite of himself, 
as he struggled to control his growing anger. "It was a king 
cobra, the largest you ever saw, and it deserved to live out its life 
in the jungle, didn't it? <DIDN'T IT?"> 
Penny 
did not answer. Now, she just sat there looking at him, without an expression 
except concern for him.   "We're all God's creatures, 
aren't we"? Keith was snarling now. "All of us- every 
goddam roach and worm and killer in that jungle. You love this village 
and these stinking brown people because they're God's creatures, 
too. And you love Ahmiri, that black bastard of a servant even 
a little more, because he's a beautiful man. And he loves you because 
you're a beautiful woman. We're all God's creatures, <aren't 
we, Penny?> All of us, that is, except me. You hate me, you 
hate my guts, because I like to hunt. You actually hate me- and we 
both know it- because I killed that filthy snake. **h Well, why don't 
you 
say something"?   Penny would not rise to his mood.

"There isn't anything left to say, is there, Keith"?

She softly let herself into the bed, and took her regular side, 
away from the door, where she slept better because Keith was between 
her and the invader. He knew she was not sulking, not even angry at 
him. Just as he knew that she had stopped loving him.   The Brahmaputra 
has its headwaters in the tableland of the world, the towering 
white headwalls of the Himalayas that are unknown to man as any 
other space on the planet. For a brief period each year, the rays of 
the sun are warm enough to melt some of the snows piled a mile deep 
at the base of the headwalls, and then the pinnacles glisten in the 
daytime at high noon, and billions of gallons of water begin their slow 
seepage under the glaciers and across the rockstrewn hanging valleys 
on their long, meandering journey to the sea- running east past the 
sky-carving massifs of Gurla Mandhata and Kemchenjunga, then turning 
south and curling down through the jungles of Assam, past the Khasi 
Hills, and into Bengal, past Sirinjani and Madaripur, until the 
hard water of the melting snows mingles with the soft drainage of fields 
and at length fans out to meld with the teeming salt depths of the 
Bay of Bengal.   Keith Sterling had looked down on the Brahmaputra 
more times than he could remember, during the war days when 
he flew over the Hump of the world, thinking it high adventure in those 
times before man was guiding himself through outer space. But Keith 
looked down more than up. He thought of the jungles below him, and 
of the wild, strange, untracked beauty there and he promised himself 
that someday he would return, on foot perhaps, to hunt in this last corner 
of the world where man is sometimes himself the hunted, and animals 
the lords.   At first it had been just a romantic dream of his, 
the same as the idea of finishing Oxford after the war. But "after 
the war" was a luxury of a phrase he did not permit himself. Wing 
Commanders in the ~RAF do not imply survival in the future either 
in their orders or in their attitudes, to their men or to themselves. 
And Keith's record of kills made him a man to listen to- a 
man paradoxically, who might even survive. He became a fighter pilot 
after the stint over the Hump in the big crates. The ~RAF was Britain's 
weapon of attrition, and flying a fighter plane was the way 
her sons could serve her best at this point in the war.   He knew 
how to shoot down Nazis. And he knew that the men talked about him 
behind his back, saying that he was one up on everybody else- including 
the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it- because he was 
chemically incapable of fear. That was true, but only half the truth. 
The other half he didn't like to recognize, even to himself. He 
enjoyed the killing. Not defending England, or being an ace, or fighting 
for humanity. He enjoyed killing. And he would have enjoyed it 
just as much if he had been a Nazi.   Nowadays, we talk as though 
the blitz were just a short skirmish. The Nazis bombed Britain, 
so the ~RAF retaliated and shot them all down. Not quite. It 
was a war of nerves, of stamina, of dogged endurance in which the stupid 
insistence of the British on their right to their own country became 
ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the Nazis, who were better 
organized and technically superior. It took a long time before the 
British tipped the balance.   Keith learned too much about air 
combat, and air killing, to be risked. They grounded him (over his protests- 
not including his true reason for wanting to fly) and put 
him 
in the Command offices.   That was where he met Penny. 
He was aware of her as a frightfully good-looking American ~WAC, 
a second lieutenant assigned to do the paper work, (regardless of how 
important <she> might have thought she was) in the Command offices, 
but that was all. Penny knew him better, on her part. He had a war 
reputation, but this was the kind of man women like even without medals. 
They don't go for bull-like muscle, as a rule. He had strength 
in his six-foot frame, but it was like the tensile steel in a rapier. 
He was on the thin side, with big hands, and the kind of wrists that 
give away the power in forearm and bicep.   His hair was black, 
already greying at the temples in the classic beauty-idiom, the only 
one permitted to a man. The pretty little twittering ~WACS said 
he had the look of eagles- and Penny, hating the cliche, had to 
admit that in this case it applied. Keith <was> an eagle.   Penny 
and Keith had no romance. No dates or hand-holding. But they met 
in one searing moment that gave them to one another instantly.

The Command offices were in the border country, up north, where the 
radar systems centralized their intelligence reports, and the fighters 
were dispatched to harry the enemy. The Nazis knew this, of course, 
and while their chief quarry was the industrial centers, they let 
a few drop every time they went over, hoping for a lucky hit.   This 
time, they had been lucky. The Command post was underground, and 
well camouflaged. But there hadn't been enough time to build it for 
keeps. There was a measure of protection in its concrete walls and 
ceiling, but the engineers who hastily installed it were well aware that 
concrete is not much better than prayer, if as efficacious, when a 
direct hit comes along.   This one was actually more of a "near 
miss". The bomb plunged into the ground near the Post, but not 
precisely into the Command room itself. There was a shattering, cracking 
sound as the concrete started to buckle, the air filled with dust 
and flying debris, and everyone in the room- men and women hit the 
floor and used the desks as turtlebacks, as ordered.   That is, 
everyone but Keith and Penny.   They stood there, just the two 
of them, in the rocking, shattering blast. Keith was on his feet because 
he didn't care at all about life any more: Penny on her feet, 
proudly, because she cared too much.   The bomb was a solitary 
one. The blast damaged, but did not destroy the room. Keith's eyes 
met Penny's as they stood there in this strange marriage of destruction. 
And, as the others began to crawl out from beneath the desks 
and tend to those wounded, and mark the several killed, he climbed across 
the debris to Penny and took her hand in his.   The chaplain 
married them, on the next day.   After the war, Penny had wanted 
Keith at least to visit her home with her. She came from Ohio, 
from what she called a "small farm" of two hundred acres, as indeed 
it was to farmer-type farmers. But to Keith's London-bred mind, 
such acreage sounded rather invincible. It wasn't that, however, which 
decided them not to go to America. Keith told Penny about his 
dream to return to India and Burma. He stressed the wild beauty of 
the mountains, and the jungles. He didn't tell her the truth he now 
freely admitted to himself. He couldn't stop killing. That was his 
true love, not Penny. The terrible power of a gun, the thing that 
blasted the soul out of a living body, man or beast, was one he never 
wanted to lose. And in the hunting land, this hunger was considered 
to be a noble thing.   When they got to Shillong, in Assam, 
he was happy. This is a paradise for hunters. This was the land of the 
sladang, the great water buffalo with horns forty inches across the 
spread. The great black leopards. The sambur buck, the jungle stag 
that is even more noble than the Scottish elk. He even hunted elephant, 
although the Asian elephant is not quite as ferocious as his African 
cousin. But there are big rogues in both countries. These were 
the ones Keith sought out- the loners, the ones who killed for the 
joy of it, like himself.   He and Penny would go out on tame elephants, 
raised from babyhood in the <keddah>. And while he was ever 
alert for game, and most particularly a tiger, Penny marvelled at the 
Eden they were traversing. They came upon cheetal deer at woodland 
pools. Peacocks strutted across their path, preening. There were fantastic 
flowers without perfume, and gaudy birds without song. Mouse 
deer played around the feet of the elephants, or fled when the mighty 
legs thrashed too close. Wild boar watched their progress with little 
pig eyes, and grunted derision when they didn't consider such game 
worthy of a shot from the .404's. 
Now, the next morning, they were anchored at The Elbow and the boat 
was riding directly over the underwater ledge where the green water turned 
to deepest blue and the cliff dropped straight down 600 fathoms, 
with the weighted line beside it; and Robinson Roy, who had gone 
down this line ten minutes before to set a new depth record for the free 
dive, was already back on the surface.   He and his safety man, 
Herr Schaffner, swam up to the boarding ladder together. The German 
courteously indicated that Robinson should mount first. Robinson 
clambered heavily into the boat, sat down, and stripped off his triple-tank 
assembly. He was frowning. He took his mask from his forehead 
and threw it, unexpectedly, across the deck.   "Temper, temper", 
Mrs& Forsythe said, laughing uneasily. A phony blonde hanging 
onto a bygone youth and beauty, but irreparably stringy in the neck, 
she was already working on her second gin and tonic, though it was 
not yet ten A&M&   "I loused it", Rob said, with a 
savage note in his voice. "All I have to do to set the record is to 
go on down. So instead I come up".   "Was it my equipment"? 
the German asked. "Was it something went bad with the breathing"?

"The equipment was fine", Rob stated, standing 
up. He was a huge young man of twenty-four, clothed in muscle, immensely 
strong, with a habitual gentleness and diffidence of manner that 
was submerged under his present agitation. He stared stonily at the 
floor. "I was down to 275. I've been that far half a dozen times. 
I don't get it why this time I should pull such a stupid trick".

"Well, I get it", Artie said, still on the ladder. "You 
are a big muscle-bound ape and you got this idea about setting 
a record. And you also got this little spark in your bird-brain that 
tells you to turn around before you drown yourself. So you turn around".

"No, it wasn't that", Rob said. A note of awe came 
into his voice. "When I came up, damnit, <I thought I was going 
down>. I came up maybe fifty feet before I knew what was happening".

"Pressure-happy", Artie said, and climbed in.

"That's right", Robinson said. "I was expecting it, sure. 
But when it happens to you like that, I tell you, and you're a 
hundred feet from where you thought you were- well, it makes you think. 
You don't head back down again. Not me, anyway. Not right away". 
He had his voice under control again: no one became aware that 
he was terrified by what had just happened to him.   Waddell, 
the newspaperman, was a fellow in his middle forties, with a graying crewcut, 
heavy-framed glasses, and a large jaw padded with fat. Now he 
was going to show how much he knew. "Our boy didn't chicken out, 
no sir. He ran into the rapture of the depths. Nitrogen narcosis. It 
makes the diver feel drunk".   "Well, that's the only way 
to be", Mrs& Forsythe said, and gave her brassy laugh. 
"Maybe not, if you're 200 feet under water", Artie said.

"Anyway", Waddell went on. "it's nothing to fool with. It 
can kill you. Personally, I don't blame him for giving up the dive,
