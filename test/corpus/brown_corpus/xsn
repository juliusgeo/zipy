Mike got to his feet. He went back to touch home plate, turned and 
walked to the dugout without looking back.   The Anniston players 
and their manager ran out on the field. They poured water over their 
catcher's face. He did not move. Then the manager called for a 
doctor. The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured 
ballplayer. Then, quickly, and a little nervously, the doctor ordered 
a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room.

Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench, watching. When the ballplayers 
started to carry the catcher off the field he said: "That 
ought to teach the sonofabitch".   Phil Rossoff, seated next 
to Deegan, got up and moved to the other end of the bench.   The 
Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout. He was 
followed by four of his men. It began to look as if something was going 
to happen. Mike sat quitely watching the manager come nearer. Eddie 
Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side. No one said a word.

The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike. 
His face was flushed.   "Deegan", the manager said, his 
voice pitched low, quivering. "That was a rotten thing to do".

"For God's sake", Mike said, waving the manager away. 
"Stop it, will you? Tell your guys not to block the plate".

"You didn't have to ram him".   "That's what <you> 
say".   The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee. It 
was a cold and calculated look. He turned and went back across the field 
to his dugout. He called in the pitcher who had been pitching, and 
a big, heavy, powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound 
for Anniston.   The game started again and in the eighth inning 
Mike Deegan came up to bat. Everyone in the ball park seemed to be 
standing and shouting.   The first ball the hefty pitcher threw 
came in for Mike's head. Deegan fell into the dirt, the ball going 
over him. He arose slowly and brushed himself off. He got back 
into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again.

"Hit the bum"! somebody yelled from the Anniston 
bench.   In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco, shortstop, whispered 
into Phil's ear: "There's gonna be a fight".

"Look at those bastards"! Charlie Haydon, a pitcher, said. 
"They're looking for trouble".   Mike was slow getting into 
the box this time. When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly 
away as the pitch came in.   "Listen"! he shouted to 
the pitcher. "One more and I'm coming out there"!   "I'll 
be waiting"! the pitcher yelled back.   Mike Deegan 
pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat. He stood flat-footed 
in the box, but not very close to the plate now. The pitcher wound 
up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head. Deegan dropped, 
got up, turned and, holding the bat with both hands up against his 
chest, began to walk slowly out to the mound. The pitcher tossed his 
glove away and came towards Mike Deegan. They were both walking towards 
each other, unhurried.   Riverside and Anniston players rushed 
out on the field. In the next moment, it seemed, the infield was 
crowded with spectators, ballplayers, cops, kids and a dog. There was 
much shouting and screaming. Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched. 
Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even 
came together.   Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players 
did not go out on the field when the fighting started.   After 
the game, Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when 
Mike Deegan came in.   "It's a helluva thing", Mike 
said, looking at Phil, "when a guy's own team-mate won't come 
out and help him in a fight".   Phil sighed and pulled the wet 
sweatshirt over his head. Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near 
Phil. The other players were undressing quietly. Eddie Lee had not 
come in yet.   Mike went over to Phil and stood over him. "Why 
the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me"?

"I didn't think it was necessary".   "Well! 
Now that's just fine! You didn't think it was necessary". Mike 
placed both his hands on his hips. He pushed his jaw forward. "Listen, 
wise guy, if you think <I'm> gonna do all the fighting 
for this ball club you're crazy".   Mike had a good two inches 
over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face.   "I 
didn't ask you to fight for the ball club", Phil said slowly. 
"Nobody else did, either".   "You trying to say <I> started 
the fight"?   "I'm not trying to say anything".

Phil turned away and opened his locker, and then he heard Mike 
Deegan say: "You're yellow, Rossoff"! and Phil banged 
his locker door shut and spun around. But before anything could happen 
Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the 
dressing room.   "Phil, come into my office", Eddie said.

Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door. He sat 
down before Eddie's desk.   "I'm doing you a favor", 
Eddie said quickly. "You get your unconditional release as of today".

Phil's eyes widened just a trifle.   "The best 
thing for you to do", Eddie said, "is go home. You don't belong 
in professional baseball".   Phil had to clear his throat. 
"Is this because of what happened out there"?   "No", 
Eddie said. "But it does confirm what I've suspected all along".

Phil stood up. "Listen! This is the second time 
**h"   "Sit down, sit down", Eddie said. "I'm not saying 
you're yellow. I <am> saying you're not a professional ballplayer".

Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk. "Now listen 
to me, Phil. I'm not steering you wrong. You haven't got 
the heart for baseball".   Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned. 
Suddenly his voice grew hard. "What the hell do you think baseball 
is? You're not in the big leagues, but if you can't give 
and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there"?

Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short. 
"Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are. I know you've 
got talent. But what you haven't got is the heart to back up 
that talent with. The heart, Phil. You just haven't got the heart 
for pro-ball, and that's it".   Dazed, Phil said: "I 
don't get it. My batting average **h"   Eddie stood up abruptly, 
then sat down just as abruptly. "What difference does your 
batting average make? Or your fielding average. Or even the way you 
run bases. I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win- 
you won't do it. <That's> what I mean by no heart for the 
game. Baseball's no cinch. Deegan had no business ramming into that 
kid out there. He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out 
of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on. 
What the hell do you think baseball is? A sport? It's a way of 
life, goddamit! And you've got 
to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody 
who want to take your way of life away from you"!   He's 
wrong! Phil thought. It's only <his> opinion. There were 
other clubs in this league. He stood up slowly. He was a little pale 
and shaky. His lips felt glued together.   "I think you're 
wrong, Eddie", he said finally.   Eddie nodded. "Okay. You'll 
get your pay in the morning".   Phil turned and left 
the room, hearing Eddie say: "Someday you'll see I was right".

Phil shut the door behind him. Outside in the dressing room, 
Frankie 
Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes.

"What happened"? Frankie asked.   Phil said: "I 
got my release".   "You crazy"?   Phil shrugged.

"What for"?   Phil sighed.   Frankie shook his 
head. "I don't get it".   "I don't know", Phil 
said.   They were silent for a few moments. Then Frankie said: 
"What are you gonna do"?   Phil started to take his clothes 
off and Frankie sat down on the bench again. Phil took off one 
shoe and stared at it.   "Don't take it like this", Frankie 
said. "Hell, plenty of guys get let out and come back later. The 
leagues are full of guys like that".   Phil was very quiet.

"What are you gonna do, Phil"?   Phil did not answer.

"Why not try another club"?   Phil looked up. 
What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that?

"Springfield's in tomorrow", Frankie said. "Talk to Whitey 
Jackson".   He just didn't know what he was talking about, 
saying a thing like that.   "Will you do it, Phil"?

"Do what"?   "Ask Whitey for a job".   Phil 
nodded. "Sure", he said. "Springfield come in tomorrow"?

Frankie nodded.   "I'll speak to Whitey".

"Atta boy".   "I'll talk to him, all right".

"Don't worry", Frankie said. "You'll get a job there. 
He needs outfielders bad".   "I'm not worried about it", 
Phil said.   "That's the way to talk. What else did Eddie 
have to say"?   "Nothing", Phil said.

Richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity. 
His broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the 
subject of religion began to fascinate him. When he was twelve he took 
to reading St& Augustine and Aquinas, then Lao-tse, Confucius, 
Mencius, Suzuki, Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous 
socio-archaeological papers. For his birthday, because Richard had 
seen them in a store and asked for them, his mother bought him the <Zend-Avesta> 
and a little image of the Indian god, Acala. And one 
day, on her own, his mother came home with a present entitled <The 
Book of the Dead>, which she suspected Richard would enjoy. He was 
enormously happy with her gift and smiled, then went to his room to 
read.   At dinner one night, when he was fourteen, Richard announced, 
"There is only one god".   "Did you think there were 
two"? grinned his father.   "You don't understand", 
Richard said gloomily.   Through quiet laughter his mother said, 
"Don't speak to your father like that, Richard".   Richard 
seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about 
religion again.   His interest in the formal study of religion waned 
when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian 
affairs. Although he still didn't speak to anyone, he grew fond 
of saying, "The future lies in Asia", when the opportunity arose, 
and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New 
York to give him a foundation, they said, for his life in Asian studies.

Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired, 
in his remoteness, a thorough if bookish knowledge of Asian lore, 
literature, life, politics and history. He was awarded a fellowship to 
continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes, the biwa 
upon which he had been practicing and his image of Acala, and left 
to spend a week at home before leaving the country.   The week at 
home was not comfortable. His mother, who had seen little of him for 
four years, appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an 
Orient which, she herself having slight knowledge of it, had to be distrusted. 
She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days
