
The new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million 
worth of 4-7/8 debentures, due June 1, 1986, at 100%, and $60 
million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1, 1991, 
at 100%. The convertible debentures are convertible into common 
shares at $65 a share by June 1, 1966; $70 by 1971; $75 by 1976; 
$80 by 1981; $85 by 1986, and $90 thereafter. 

_NEW YORK(~AP)_- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly 
solid rise but here also trading dwindled. Volume was 1.23 million 
shares, down from Monday's 1.58 million. Gains of 2-3/4 were posted 
for Teleprompter and Republic Foil. Fairchild Camera and Kawecki 
Chemical gained 2-1/2 each. 

_QUESTION_- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund 
on Oct& 23, 1959, and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on 
Feb& 8, 1960. Something has gone wrong some place. I am getting 
dividends on only 50 shares. In other words, I am getting only half 
the dividends I should. _ANSWER_- Write to the fund's custodian 
bank- the First National Bank of Jersey City, N&J&. 
That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock 
Fund, Fundamental Investors, Diversified Investment Fund and 
Television-Electronics Fund.   The bank installed a magnetic 
tape electronic data processing system to handle things. But it seems 
that this "electronic brain" wasn't "programmed" correctly.

This resulted in a great number of errors. And letters began 
to come in to this column from irate shareholders.   I visited 
the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation. At that time, 
the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation 
in hand. They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all 
old errors would be corrected 
"within 60 days".   That 60-day 
period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of 
these four funds, complaining about mistakes in their accounts. 
Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers 
expected. Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake 
in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank.   {Doyle

_WASHINGTON (~AP)_- Alfred Hayes, president of the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday "there is no present need 
for far-reaching reforms" which would basically alter the international 
financial system.   Hayes said that if a way can be found 
to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations, 
"there is no reason, in my judgment why the international financial 
system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable 
future". 

_WASHINGTON (~UPI)_- New York Central Railroad president Alfred 
E& Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of 
bankruptcy if the Chesapeake + Ohio and Baltimore + Ohio Railroads 
merge.   Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect 
of the merger, but could possibly be an ultimate effect.   The 
railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate 
Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the ~C+~O's 
request to control and then merge with the ~B+~O.

"All these kind of things weaken us", Perlman said. 

#BAD 
CONDITION#

Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore + Ohio 
Railroad Co&, testified the ~B+~O was in its worst financial 
condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic 
lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad.

"The financial situation of the Baltimore + Ohio, 
has become precarious- much worse than at any time since the depression 
of the 1930s", he told the hearing.   ~C+~O president 
Walter J& Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New 
York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing 
the complex case.   The New York Central also has asked the 
~ICC to permit it to gain control of the ~B+~O.   Central 
was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to 
make it a three-way merger. The proposed ~C+~O-~B+~O railroad 
would make it the hemisphere's second largest. 

_WASHINGTON (~AP)_- The government's short-term borrowing costs 
rose with Tuesday weekly offering of Treasury bills. On $1.1 billion 
of 90-day bills, the average yield was 2.325%. The rate a week 
ago was 2.295%. 

_WASHINGTON, MARCH 11 (~UPI)._- "Consumer uncertain about economic 
conditions".   This was the chief reason for a so-so sales 
outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National 
Housing Center.   Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more 
of the builders were "resistance to high interest rates, cost advantage 
of buying over renting has narrowed, shelter market nearing saturation 
and prospects unable to qualify". 

#INCREASE EXPECTED#

The 
poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference. 
It disclosed that the builders:   Expect their own production 
volume, and presumably sales, to jump 30 percent in 1961.

Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent 
this year from 1960's 1,257,7000 non-farm housing starts. The industry 
has said 1960 was a poor year. Starts were down 20 percent from 
1959.   Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for 
themselves and for the industry? 

#LEADERS OF INDUSTRY#

The 
reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders invited to the 
intentions conference "are generally among the more successful businessmen, 
and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders". 

_ELBURN, ILL&_- Farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back 
in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales: "We've 
sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 
10 more. We sold only four pickers all last year".   Gus Ehlers, 
competitor of Mr& Houtz in this farm community, says his business 
since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier. "Before 
then, my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%", 
he says.   Though the sales gains these two dealers are 
experiencing are above average for their business, farm equipment sales 
are climbing in most rural areas. Paradoxically, the sales rise is 
due in large 
measure to Government efforts to slash farm output. Although 
the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point 
since 1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather, 
are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced 
to buy new harvesting machines. Fields of corn and some other crops 
in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them 
efficiently. 
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation, 
together with rising prices for farm products, are pushing up farm income, 
making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery.

Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery 
say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown 
gains averaging nearly 10% above last year. "In August our dealers 
sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September 
retail sales were 14% higher than last year", says Mark V& 
Keeler, farm equipment vice president of International Harvester 
Co&. For the year to date, sales of the company's farm equipment 
dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960. 

#TWO OF THREE REPORT GAINS# 

Among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states, 
two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains 
from a year earlier, with the increases ranging from 5% to 50%. 
Not all sections are showing an upswing, however; the drought-seared 
North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend.

The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends 
beyond the farm equipment industry. The demand for farm machinery 
is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally. Farmers spend 
more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group 
of products. More than 20 million people live on farms and they own 
a fourth of the nation's trucks, buy more gasoline than any other 
industry and provide a major market for home appliances, chemicals and 
other products.   Farmers are so eager for new machinery that 
they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago, dealers 
report.   "Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so 
we can get more money on a sale", says Jack Martin, who sells J& 
I& Case tractors and implements in Sioux City, Iowa. "This 
morning, we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on 
a new $2,700 model. Last year, we probably would have given him $700 
for a comparable machine". Mr& Martin sold 21 tractors in August; 
in August of 1960, he sold seven. 

#DEALERS' STOCKS DOWN# 

With dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year 
ago, the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately 
by the country's farm equipment manufacturers. For example, farm 
equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed 
about 5% above a year earlier, Mr& Keeler reports.   Tractor 
production at Massey-Ferguson, Ltd&, of Toronto in July and 
August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier, 
says John Staiger, vice president.   With the lower dealer 
inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there 
could be shortages of some implements. Merritt D& Hill, Ford Motor 
Co& vice president, says his company is starting to get calls 
daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping 
dates on orders for corn pickers.   Except for a few months 
in late 1960 and early 1961, retail farm equipment sales have trailed 
year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959. The rise in sales 
last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program 
was adopted; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% 
in 
planted acreage and, as a result, reduced the immediate need for machines.

Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers 
say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement 
in crop prospects. Total farm output for this year is officially 
forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average, three points higher than 
the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960.

The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects. Agriculture 
Department economists estimate the Government this year will 
hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments,
