the Green Jungle parking lot. "That story of hers about an unsigned 
note directing her to be there tonight sounds completely phony. If 
it was designed to put me on the spot, it would have to have been written 
before Peralta ever called me in on the case".   "Do 
you think Laura did have the counterfeit bracelet made without her husband's 
knowledge"?   "I haven't the faintest idea. I 
think her husband strongly suspects so, and that's why he called me 
in on the thing in direct defiance of his confederates **h and almost 
certainly without telling them why he was doing so. Isn't this Felice's 
street"? Shayne asked, peering ahead at the partially 
obscured street sign.   Rourke could see it better out the right-hand 
side, and he said, "Yes. Turn to the left, I think, for that 
number you gave me. Not more than a block or so".   Shayne 
got in the left-hand lane and cut across the Boulevard divider. There 
was a small, neon-lighted restaurant and cocktail lounge on the southeast 
corner of the intersection as he turned into the quiet, palm-lined 
street where most of the houses on both sides were older two-story 
mansions, now cut up into furnished rooms and housekeeping apartments.

Shayne drove westward from the Boulevard slowly, letting Rourke 
crane his head out the window and watch for street numbers. A single 
automobile was parked half-way up the block on the left-hand side. 
Shayne noted idly that it carried Miami Beach license plates as he 
approached, and then saw the flare of a match in the front seat as they 
passed, indicating that it was occupied.   He turned to see 
the briefly-illumed faces of two men in the parked car just as Rourke 
said, "It's the next house, Mike. On the right".   Instead 
of pulling into the curb, Shayne increased his speed slightly to 
the corner where he swung left. He went around the corner and parked, 
turning off his lights and motor.   "I told you, Mike", said 
Rourke in an aggrieved voice. "It was back there **h".

Shayne said, "I know it was, Tim". His voice was chilling and 
cold. "Did you see the car parked across the street"? 
"I didn't notice it. I was watching for numbers **h".   "It 
has a Beach license, Tim. Two men in the front seat. I got a 
quick look at their faces as we went past. Unless I'm crazy as hell, 
they're two of Painter's dicks. A couple named Harris and Geely. 
Those names mean anything to you"?   "Wait a minute, 
Mike. In Painter's office this evening **h".   Shayne 
nodded grimly. "The pair whom Petey is officially commending for 
slapping me around and pulling me in".   "What are they doing 
here"?   "A stake-out, I suppose. On Felice Perrin. 
Maybe with specific orders to see that I don't make contact with her. 
I'm not positive, Tim. I may be wrong. I'll slide out and 
walk around the block back to the cocktail lounge on Biscayne. You drive 
on and circle back and pull up beside them parked there. You're 
a reporter, and you're looking for Miss Perrin to interview her. 
Make them show their hands. If they are Beach cops on a stake-out, 
they'll admit it to a reporter. They've got no official standing 
on this side of the Bay. As soon as you find out if they are Geely 
and Harris, come on around to the lounge where I'll be waiting".

Shayne opened the door on his side and stepped out. Timothy 
Rourke groaned dismally as he slid under the wheel. "The things you 
talk me into, Mike **h".   Shayne chuckled. "How often 
do they add up to headlines? You should complain".   He crossed 
the street and walked swiftly southward to circle back to the Boulevard 
and north a block to the open restaurant.   He was standing 
at the end of the bar enjoying a slug of cognac when Rourke came 
in six or eight minutes later. The reporter nodded as he moved up beside 
him at the bar. Shayne told the bartender, "Bourbon and water", 
and Rourke told him, "It's those two, all right. Harris and 
Geely. I made them show me their identification before I could be 
persuaded not to call on Felice Perrin".   Shayne said happily, 
"I've got it all worked out, Tim. Take your time with your 
drink. I'll beat it. In exactly three minutes, go in that phone 
booth behind you and call Police Headquarters. Be excited and don't 
identify yourself. Just say that a couple of drunks are having a hell 
of a fight down the street, and they better send a patrol car. Then 
hang up fast and come walking on down to the Perrin address. I'll 
be waiting for you there".   The bartender brought Rourke's 
drink and Shayne laid a twenty-dollar bill on the bar. He said in 
a low voice, "I've got a date with a lady, Mister. Will that 
pay for a pint I can take with me. You know how it is", he added with 
a conspiratorial wink. "Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker **h 
and you don't have any candy for sale here anyhow".   "We 
sure don't". The bartender winked back at him and palmed the bill. 
He turned away and returned in a moment with a pint of brandy in 
a small paper sack which he slid over the counter to Shayne. 
As the detective slid it into his pocket, Rourke asked sadly, "What 
in hell are you going to do, Mike"?   "Make a couple of 
punk detectives named Geely and Harris wish to God they'd stayed 
out of my way this afternoon. Three minutes, Tim".   Shayne 
strode out blithely, and Rourke checked his watch and sipped his drink, 
getting a dime ready to make the telephone call to the police.

Outside, Shayne hesitated when he saw that Rourke had parked his 
coupe directly in front of the bar headed south. He walked over to 
the right-hand door, opened it and got the reloaded automatic out of 
the glove compartment and put it in his hip pocket. He hoped he wouldn't 
be forced to use it in taking care of the Beach detectives, but 
its weight was comforting at his hip. On this side of the Bay, Miami 
Beach cops had no more legal rights than any ordinary citizen, and 
Shayne's pistol permit was just as good as theirs.   He went 
swiftly up the sidewalk toward the parked car with the two Beach detectives 
in the front seat. He tugged the brim of his hat low as he approached, 
stepped out into the street just behind the car and strode around 
to the right-hand side.   The big, paunchy man named Geely 
was on that side, half-turned in the seat toward his hatchet-faced 
companion so that his back partially rested against the closed door.

Shayne turned the handle and jerked the door open before either 
of the men were quite aware of his presence in the night.   Geely 
grunted and slid partly out, and Shayne's left arm snaked in around 
his neck to help him, while he set himself solidly on the roadway 
and swung his right fist to the big, gum-chewing jaw before Geely could 
straighten up.   Shayne stepped back to let him slump to the 
ground, and then dived over him through the open door into Harris who 
was cursing loudly and trying to drag a gun from a shoulder holster, 
somewhat impeded by the steering wheel.   Shayne locked his big 
hands around Harris' thin neck and dragged him out over the seat into 
the roadway. He hit him once on the sharp point of his chin and felt 
the body go limp. He dropped him into the street a couple of feet 
away from Geely's recumbent figure and stared down at both of them 
for a moment before kicking the big man lightly in the side. He didn't 
stir. They were both breathing heavily, out cold, and Shayne didn't 
think either of them had recognized him or could describe him.

He got the pint of liquor out of his pocket and unscrewed the 
top, sprinkled the pungent stuff liberally over both men, and then tossed 
the open bottle in on the front seat.   He turned, then, to 
look toward the lighted Boulevard, and saw Rourke's tall, emaciated 
figure come out of the lounge and hurriedly start to angle across the 
street toward the opposite side.   Shayne strolled across to intercept 
the reporter in front of the two-story house where Felice Perrin 
lived, and asked casually, "Get the police okay"? 
"Sure. Said they'd have a patrol car here fast. Let's get inside. 
What happened with you"?   "Why the two damned fools 
got all excited when they saw the bottle, and knocked each other out 
cold", Shayne said good-humoredly. "They'll have fun explaining 
that to the Miami cops. Got no business over here on a stake-out anyway".

They went up onto a front porch and into a small hallway 
where a dim bulb burned high in the ceiling. A row of mailboxes 
along the wall had numbers and names on them. Shayne found one marked 
PERRIN ~2-A.   The stairway on the right was dark, but 
there was a wall-switch at the bottom which lighted another dim bulb 
at the top, and they went up.   There were two front rooms, both 
dark behind their transoms, and there was no sound or light in the entire 
house to indicate that any of the occupants were awake.

Eight, nine steps above him, Roberts had paused. Mickey paused 
with him, waiting, no longer impatient, trying now to think it out, 
do a little planning. He looked down over the banister at the hotel desk, 
with the telephone and pen set.   If I could call in, they 
could check the story while we were on our way. I wouldn't have to 
tell them I had Roberts-   Then he heard it, like a muffled 
thud, felt a subtle change in air pressure. He glanced up in time to 
see Roberts hurtling down on him from above, literally flying through 
the air, his bloody face twisted. Mickey tried to flatten against the 
banister, gripped it with one hand, but Roberts' full weight struck 
him at that moment in the groin. He gasped for air and the impact 
tore 
his hand from the rail. He tumbled with Roberts, helpless and in 
agony, over and over, down the steps.   By a wrenching effort, 
he managed to hunch and draw in, to take the final fall on his back and 
shoulders rather than his head. He was fuzzy in his mind and, for a 
moment, helpless on the lobby floor, but he was conscious, and free of 
the weight of Roberts' body. When his vision cleared he saw the taller 
one scrambling upward, reaching. Mickey was on his knees when Roberts 
turned on the stairs and the razor flashed in his hand. He felt 
his empty pocket and knew that Roberts had retrieved the only weapon 
at hand.   Mickey's eyes fixed on the other's feet, which 
would first betray the moment and direction of an attack. He rose stiffly, 
forcing his knees to lock. The knifelike pain in his groin nearly 
brought him down again. He made himself back off slowly, his eyes 
wary on Roberts, who now had no more to lose than he. The pain dulled 
as he moved, and he steadied inside. After a moment he extended one 
hand, the fingers curled.   "Come on", he said. "You want 
to be that big a fool- I was hoping for this".   Roberts 
brushed at his eyes with his free hand and started down the steps. He 
held the razor well out to one side. He was invulnerable to attack, 
but he could be handled, Mickey knew, if he could be brought to make 
the first move.   They were eight feet apart when Roberts cleared 
the last step. Mickey waited with slack arms.   "Any time, 
Roberts", he said. "Or would it be easier if I put my hands in 
my pockets"?   The taunt was lost on Roberts. He advanced 
slowly, directly, giving no hint of a feint to either side. He was 
just short of arm's reach when he stopped. Mickey backed off two steps, 
forcing him to come on again. There was a fixed grin on Roberts' 
face, made hideous by the swollen nose and the smeared blood.

Mickey backed off again and Roberts hesitated, then came along. 
They moved in a series of rhythmic fits and starts, a macabre dance- 
two steps back, two steps forward, two steps back. Mickey felt his shoulders 
come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door. This 
was going to be it now, any second, and what he had to remember was 
to keep his eye on the razor, no matter what, even if Roberts should 
feint with a kick to the groin, the deadly hand was his exclusive concern.

The kick came, sudden and vicious but short. Mickey's 
guts twisted with the effort, but he kept his eye on the weapon. It 
moved in a silver arc toward his throat, then veered downward. He hunched 
his left shoulder into it and slashed at Roberts' forearm with 
his own, felt the blade slide off his sleeve. Before Roberts could 
move inside to cut upward toward his face, he slammed his right fist into 
Roberts' belly. Roberts sagged and slashed at him wildly. Ducking, 
Mickey tripped and fell to one side, landing heavily on the wood 
floor. Then Roberts was on him, gasping for breath and for a couple
