thanks to this modern witch doctor.   But the machine quack 
can cause far more than just suffering. In such diseases as cancer, 
tuberculosis, and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are so 
vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's 
cure-all gadget can prove fatal. Moreover, the diabetic patient who relies 
on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake 
can be committing suicide. For instance:   In Chicago, 
some time ago, Mr& H&, age 27, a diabetic since he was six, stopped 
using 
insulin because he had bought a "magic spike"- a glass tube 
about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small 
fraction of a cent- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 
as a cure-all. "Hang this around your neck or attach it to other 
parts of your anatomy, and its rays will cure any disease you have", 
said the company. Mr& H& is dead today because he followed this 
advice.   Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken 
by her husband to see Otis G& Carroll, a sanipractor- a licensed 
drugless healer- in Spokane. Carroll diagnosed Mrs& Hull by 
taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his "radionic" 
machine and twirling some knobs (fee $50).   His prescription: 
hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water. Although 
she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted 
her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water. 
Inevitably, Mrs& Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis, weighing 
60 pounds. Moreover, her husband and child contracted T&B& 
from her. (Small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 
for his wife's death.)   In California, a few years ago, a ghoul 
by the name of H& F& Bell sold electric blankets as a cure 
for cancer. He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric 
blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died, 
reconditioning them, and selling them at $185 each. When authorities 
convicted him of practicing medicine without a license (he got off with 
a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 
77), one of his victims was not around to testify: He was dead of 
cancer.   By no means are these isolated cases. "Unfortunately", 
says Chief Postal Inspector David H& Stephens, who has prosecuted 
many device quacks, "the ghouls who trade on the hopes of 
the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the 
patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up 
in court". ##

DEATH! Have no doubt about it. That's 
where device quackery can lead. The evidence shows that fake therapeutic 
machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have hastened the 
deaths of thousands.   Who are the victims of the device quacks? 
Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target. Says Wallace 
F& Jannsen, director of the ~FDA's Division of Public Information: 
"Quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older 
people, or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, 
diabetes, and cancer. People who have not been able to get 
relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in 
by quacks". The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people, like 
Mr& A&, who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice 
to Doctor Fraud's avarice. They are often ignorant as well as 
underprivileged.

TEN-YEAR-OLD Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome 
for almost a year. His grades had gone steadily downhill, and 
he had stopped bringing 
friends and classmates home from school.

Mr& and Mrs& Stewart were puzzled and concerned. Then one day 
Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door, let the cat out of the 
bag. The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick "Bugs 
Bunny" because his teeth protruded.   When Richard's parents 
told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist- a dentist who 
specializes in realigning teeth and jaws- their young son was interested. 
During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly 
with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved- 
an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his 
facial appearance.   Richard Stewart is no special case. "The 
majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form 
of orthodontic treatment", says Dr& Allan G& Brodie, professor 
and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of 
Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field. 
What do parents need to know about those "years of the braces" in 
order not to waste a child's time and their money? How can they 
tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment? Why and when should 
tooth-straightening be undertaken? What is it likely to cost? 

#TOOTH FIT EXPLAINED#

OCCLUSION is the dentist's expression 
for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed. Malocclusion, 
or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for. One main type 
of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper 
front teeth. A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the 
face, a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped lower 
jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type 
of malocclusion.   These two basic malformations have, of course, 
many variations. A child probably requires some form of treatment 
if he has any of the following conditions: _@_ A noticeable 
protrusion of the upper or lower jaw. _@_ Crooked, overlapping, 
twisted, or widely spaced teeth. _@_ Front teeth not meeting 
when the back teeth close. _@_ Upper teeth completely covering 
the lowers when the back teeth close. _@_ The eyeteeth (third from 
the middle on top, counting each front tooth as the first) beginning 
to protrude like fangs. _@_ Second teeth that have come in before 
the first ones have fallen out, making a double row.   Contrary 
to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago, when all malocclusion was 
blamed on some unfortunate habit, recent studies show that most tooth 
irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition. 
However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must 
necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.   Tooth deformity 
may be the result of <excessive> thumb- or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting, 
or lip-sucking- but it's important to remember that 
there's a difference between <normal> and <excessive> sucking 
habits. It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and 
no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two 
or three years old. Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect 
a youngster's teeth; but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure 
is frequent, it will have an effect.   Malocclusion can also 
result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long. If a child 
loses a molar at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward 
the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent 
ones and producing a jumble. If baby teeth are retained too long, the 
incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal 
time or may have to erupt in the wrong place. 

#CORRECTION CAN SAVE TEETH# 

EVERY orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by 
their malformed teeth. Some such youngsters rarely smile, or they try 
to speak with the mouth closed. In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's, 
a child's personality is affected. Yet from the dentist's 
point of view, bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.

Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through 
a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots. This serious 
condition, popularly known as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes 
of tooth loss in adults.   Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together 
teeth are prone to trapping food particles, increasing the 
likelihood of rapid decay. "For these and other reasons", says Dr& 
Brodie, "orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth".

The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal 
chewing, so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden 
on his digestive system. Because of these chewing troubles, a child may 
avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition. Badly placed 
teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping. 

#THE WHEN AND 
HOW OF STRAIGHTENING#

"MOST orthodontic work is done on children 
between the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients 
as young as two and as old as 55", says Dr& Brodie.   In 
the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed, 
yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed 
teeth comparatively easy. Orthodontic work is possible because teeth 
are held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal membrane with 
an involved nerve network, to the bone in the jaw; they are not 
anchored directly to the bone. Abnormal pressure, applied over a period 
of time, produces a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions 
normally in the new position into which it has been guided.   What 
can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's 
office? On her first visit the orthodontist will take ~X rays, 
photographs, tooth measurements, and "tooth prints"- an impression 
of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws. 
If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for Susie an appliance 
consisting of bands, plastic plates, fine wires, and tiny springs. This 
appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure 
on the bone. As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure side 
of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on the side from which the 
tooth has moved. This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue 
grows, and no faster.   "If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious 
injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding 
bone holding them in place", explains Dr& Brodie. "Moving one 
or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an ill-conceived plan 
of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face".

During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately 
following each adjustment, Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness, 
but after a short time this will disappear. Parents are often 
concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay. When 
in place, a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth 
that is covered.   Next Susie will enter the treatment stage 
and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on the severity 
of her condition. During these visits the dentist will adjust 
the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.   Last comes the 
<retention> stage. Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable 
new position. But because teeth sometimes may drift back to 
their original position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them in 
place. Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and 
stretching across the teeth. Susie may wear this only at night or for 
a few hours during the day.   Then comes the time when the last 
wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive 
girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.   How long 
will this take? Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may 
take only a few months. Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more. 
An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three 
years to correct. 

#WHAT IS THE COST?#

THE charge for a 
complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country. Work 
that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 
in New York City or Chicago. An average national figure for two 
to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000.   "Factors
