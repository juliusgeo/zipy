was distilled on a Vigreux column, a 25% center cut being retained 
which was then degassed under vacuum in the presence of **f. Purified 
inactive chlorine was then added from one of the tubes described 
above and the mixture frozen out and sealed off in a flask equipped with 
a break seal. This chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution was illuminated 
for a day following which the flask was resealed onto a vacuum 
system and the excess chlorine distilled off. The required amount of 
carbon tetrachloride was distilled into a series of reaction cells on 
a manifold on a vacuum line. The desired amounts of inactive chlorine 
and radioactive chlorine were likewise condensed in these cells on 
the vacuum line following which they were frozen down and the manifold 
as a whole was sealed off. The contents of the manifold for liquid phase 
experiments were then mixed by shaking, redistributed to the reaction 
tubes, frozen down, and each tube was then sealed off. The reactants 
for the gas phase experiments were first frozen out in a side-arm 
attached to the manifold and then allowed to distil slowly into the manifold 
of pre-cooled reaction cells before sealing off. This method 
in general solved the problem of obtaining fairly equal concentrations 
of reactants in each of the six cells from a set. _REACTION CONDITIONS 
AND ANALYSIS._- The samples for liquid phase thermal reaction 
studies were prepared in Pyrex capillary tubing 2.5 mm& i&d& and 
about 15 cm& long. In a few experiments the tubes were made from 
standard 6 mm& i&d& Pyrex tubing of 1 mm& wall thickness. Both 
types of tube withstood the pressure of approximately 20 atmospheres 
exerted by the carbon tetrachloride at 220`. The photochemical reaction 
cells consisted of 10 mm& i&d& Pyrex tubing, 5.5 cm& 
long, diffraction effects being minimized by the fact that the light passed 
through only liquid-glass interfaces and not gas-glass interfaces. 
These cells were used rather than square Pyrex tubing because 
of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon 
tetrachloride. The round cells were reproducibly positioned in the 
light beam which entered the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window. 
Two types of light source were used, a thousand watt projection 
lamp and an ~AH6 high pressure mercury arc. The light was filtered 
by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensuring that 
only light absorbed by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride 
could enter the reaction cell. Relative incident light intensities 
were measured with a thermopile potentiometer system. Changes of intensity 
on the cell were achieved by use of a wire screen and by varying 
the distance of the light source from the cell.   Following reaction 
the cells were scratched with a file and opened under a 20% aqueous 
sodium iodide solution. Carrier **f was added and the aqueous and 
organic phases were separated (cells containing gaseous reactants were 
immersed in liquid air before opening under sodium iodide). After 
titration of the liberated **f with **f, aliquots of the aqueous and 
of the organic 
phase were counted in a solution-type Geiger tube. In the liquid 
phase runs the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube was 
determined by weighing the tube before opening and weighing the fragments 
after emptying. The fraction of exchange was determined as the 
ratio of the counts/minute observed in the carbon tetrachloride to the 
counts/minute calculated for the carbon tetrachloride fractions for 
equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon 
tetrachloride, empirically determined correction being made for the 
difference in counting efficiency of **f in **f and **f. 

#RESULTS# 

_THE THERMAL REACTION._- In studying the liquid phase thermal 
reaction, some 70 tubes from 12 different manifold fillings were prepared 
and analyzed. Experiments were done at 180, 200, 210, 220`. Following 
observation of the fact that the reaction rates of supposedly 
identical reaction mixtures prepared on the same filling manifold and 
exposed under identical conditions often differed by several hundred per 
cent&, a systematic series of experiments was undertaken to see whether 
the difficulty could be ascribed to the method of preparing the chlorine, 
to the effects of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface 
to volume ratio in the reaction tubes. In addition to the method 
described in the section above, chlorine and radiochlorine were prepared 
by the electrolysis of a **f eutectic on the vacuum line, and by exchange 
of **f with molten **f. Calcium hydride was substituted for **f 
as a drying agent for carbon tetrachloride. No correlation between 
these variables and the irreproducibility of the results was found.

The reaction rates observed at 200` ranged from **f of the chlorine 
exchanged per hour to 0.7 exchanged per hour. In most cases the 
chlorine 
concentration was about **f. Sets of reaction tubes containing 0.2 of 
an atmosphere of added oxygen in one case and added moisture in another, 
both gave reaction rates in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine 
exchanged per hour. No detectable reaction was found at room temperature 
for reaction mixtures allowed to stand up to 5 hours. _THE LIQUID 
PHASE PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTION._- The liquid phase photochemical 
exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride was more reproducible 
than the thermal exchange, although still erratic. The improvement 
was most noticeable in the greater consistency among reaction cells 
prepared as a group on the same manifold. Rather large differences were 
still found between reaction cells from different manifold fillings. 
Some 80 reaction tubes from 13 manifold fillings were illuminated in 
the temperature range from 40 to 85` in a further endeavor to determine 
the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on 
the activation energy and the effect of light intensity. In all cases 
there was readily measurable exchange after as little as one hour of 
illumination. By comparing reaction cells sealed from the same manifold 
temperature dependency corresponding to activation energies ranging 
from 11 to 18 **f was observed while dependence on the first power of 
the light intensity seemed to be indicated in most cases.   It 
was possible to make estimates of the quantum yield by observing the extent 
of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminated 
for a known time in a typical reaction cell and making appropriate conversions 
based on the differences in the absorption spectra of uranyl 
oxalate and of chlorine, and considering the spectral distribution of 
the light source. These estimates indicated that the quantum yield 
for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65` 
is of the order of magnitude of unity.   When typical reaction 
cells to which 0.3 of an atmosphere of oxygen had been added were illuminated, 
chlorine and phosgene were produced. Exchange was also observed 
in these cells, which had chlorine present at **f. _THE PHOTOCHEMICAL 
EXCHANGE IN THE GAS PHASE._- Although there was some variation 
in results which must be attributed either to trace impurities or 
to variation in wall effects, the photochemical exchange in the gas phase 
was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare 
the reaction rates in different series of reaction tubes for the purpose 
of obtaining information on the effect of chlorine concentration 
and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate. Data 
on such comparisons together with data on the effect of light intensity 
are given in Table /1.,   In series /1, the relative light 
intensity was varied by varying the distance of the lamp from the 
reaction cell over the range from 14.7 to 29.2 cm&. The last column 
shows the rate of exchange that would have been oserved at a relative 
intensity of 4 (14.7 cm& distance) calculated on the assumptions that 
the incident light intensity is inversely proportional to the square 
of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate is directly 
proportional to the incident light intensity. Direct proportionality 
of the rate to the incident intensity has also been assumed in obtaining 
the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series /2, 
where the light intensity was reduced by use of a screen. 
The Poynting-Robertson effect (Robertson, 1937; Wyatt and Whipple, 
1950), which is a retardation of the orbital motion of particles 
by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging 
solar radiation, causes the dust to spiral into the sun in times much 
shorter than the age of the Earth. The radial velocity varies inversely 
as the particle size- a 1000-~|m-diameter particle near the 
orbit of Mars would reach the sun in about 60 million years. Whipple 
(1955) extends the effects to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation 
pressure, which increases both the minimum particle size and the drag. 
Further, the corpuscular radiation, <i&e&>, the solar-wind protons, 
must sputter away the surface atoms of the dust and cause a slow 
diminution in size, with a resultant increase in both the Poynting-Robertson 
effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational 
force.   The Poynting-Robertson effect causes the semi-major 
axis of orbits to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis, 
with a consequent tendency toward circular orbits as the particles move 
toward the sun. Also, planetary gravitational attraction increases 
the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic as the sun is 
approached. At one astronomical unit from the sun (the Earth's distance) 
the dust orbits are probably nearly circular. If such is the case, 
the particles within a distance of about **f ~km of the Earth 
will 
have, relative to the Earth, a kinetic energy less than their potential 
energy and they will be captured into orbits about the Earth. De 
Jager (1955) has calculated the times required for these particles 
to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the Poynting-Robertson 
effect, which in this case causes the orbits to become more and more 
eccentric 
without changing the semi-major axis. This effect can give rise to 
a blanket of micrometeorites around the Earth.   Since there is 
a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the 
radiation effects, there must be a continual replenishment: otherwise, 
micrometeorites would have disappeared from interplanetary space. There 
are several possible sources. According to Whipple (1955), cometary 
debris is sufficient to replenish the material spiraling into the 
sun, maintaining a fairly steady state. Asteroidal collisions are also 
thought to contribute material. It is also possible that some of 
the dust in the vicinity of the Earth originated from meteoritic impacts 
upon the moon. 

#5.3 DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF MICROMETEORITE FLUX# 

One cannot make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite 
flux in space. Even in the neighborhood of the Earth, where information 
has been obtained both directly and indirectly, the derived flux 
values vary by at least four orders of magnitude. This large discrepancy 
demonstrates the inadequacies of the experimental methods and the 
lack of understanding of the various phenomena involved. Beyond a 
few million kilometers from the Earth, but still in the region of the 
Earth's orbit, a prediction of the flux of dust is even more unreliable. 
At greater distances from the sun, the situation is still less 
certain.   There are several sources of evidence on the micrometeorite 
environment. Direct information has been obtained from rockets 
and satellites equipped with impact sensors. In addition, the size 
distribution obtained from visual and radar observations of meteors may 
be extrapolated to the micrometeorite domain. From the brightness of 
the ~F component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal 
light, an estimate of the particle sizes, concentrations, and spatial 
distribution can be derived for regions of space near the ecliptic 
plane. Another important source of evidence only recently receiving 
much attention is the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic 
component. The cores of deep-sea sediments and content of collectors 
in remote regions are valuable in this category. The data provide a 
measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the Earth.

The direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the 
Earth is 
obtained from piezoelectric sensors (essentially microphones) 
and from wire gages; these instruments are installed on rockets, satellites, 
and space probes. Statistically, the most significant data have 
been collected from the sensors on 1958 Alpha (Explorer /1,), 
1958 Delta 2 (Sputnik /3,), and 1959 Eta (Vanguard /3,). These 
vehicles, with large sensitive areas, have collected data for long enough
