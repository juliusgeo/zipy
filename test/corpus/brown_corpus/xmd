have shown that these procedures influence the hypothalamically controlled 
hypophyseal secretions and increase sympathetic discharges. 
They shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side. This explains 
the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depressions 
and a shift in the reaction from hypo- to normal reactivity of the 
sympathetic system as shown by the Mecholyl test. Some investigators 
have found a parallelism between remissions and return of the sympathetic 
reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level as indicated 
by the Mecholyl test and, conversely, between clinical impairment and 
increasing deviation of this test from the norm. Nevertheless, the 
theory that the determining influence of the hypothalamic balance has 
a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patients 
has not yet been tested on an adequate number of patients. The 
Mecholyl and noradrenalin tests applied with certain precautions are 
reliable indicators of this central autonomic balance, but for the sake 
of correlating autonomic and clinical states, and of studying the effect 
of certain therapeutic procedures on central autonomic reactions, 
additional tests seem to be desirable.   It was assumed that the 
shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occurring spontaneously in 
neuropsychiatric 
patients from the application of certain therapeutic procedures 
follows the pattern known from the sleep-wakefulness cycle. 
A change in the balance to the parasympathetic side leads in the normal 
individual to sleep or, in special circumstances, to cardiovascular 
collapse or nausea and vomiting. In both conditions the emotional and 
perceptual sensitivity is diminished, but no depression occurs such 
as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons by drugs. The 
fundamental differences between physiological and pathological states 
of parasympathetic (and also of sympathetic) dominance remain to be 
elucidated.   Perhaps a clue to these and related problems lies 
in the fact that changes in the intensity of hypothalamic discharges 
which are associated with changes in its balance lead also to <qualitative> 
alterations in reactivity. A state of parasympathetic "tuning" 
of the hypothalamus induced experimentally causes not only an increase 
in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and 
reflexly induced stimuli, but leads also to an autonomic reversal: 
a stimulus acting sympathetically under control conditions elicits in 
this state of tuning a parasympathetic response! Furthermore, conditioned 
reactions are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic 
reactivity is augmented beyond a critical level, and several types 
of behavioral changes probably related to the degree of central autonomic 
"tuning" are observed. If, for instance, such a change is 
produced by one or a few insulin comas or electroshocks, previously 
inhibited conditioned reactions reappear. However, if these procedures 
are applied more often, conditioned emotional responses are temporarily 
abolished. In other studies, loss of differentiation in previously 
established conditioned reflexes resulted from repeated convulsive (metrazol) 
treatments, suggesting a fundamental disturbance in the balance 
between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes.   It has 
further been shown that: (1) an experimental neurosis in its initial 
stages is associated with a reversible shift in the central autonomic 
balance; (2) drugs altering the hypothalamic balance alter conditioned 
reactions; (3) in a state of depression, the positive conditioned 
stimulus may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction but cause an increased 
synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing (alerting) 
effect on the ~EEG. These are few and seemingly disjointed data, 
but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alterations 
in conditioned reactions occur in a variety of states in which the hypothalamic 
balance has been altered by physiological experimentation, 
pharmacological action, or clinical processes. #/14,. ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL 
BASIS OF SOME FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY#

The foregoing remarks 
imply 
that the hypothalamic balance plays a crucial role at the crossroads 
between physiological and pathological forms of emotion. If this is 
the case, one would expect that not only the various procedures just 
mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional 
state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise. We 
pointed out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorders 
and neurotic symptoms, particularly in certain types of personality, 
but it is also known that the reliving of a strong emotion ("abreaction") 
may cure a battle neurosis. This phenomenon raises the question 
whether the guidance of the emotions for therapeutic ends may not 
have an even wider application in the area of the neuroses. Being 
a strictly 
physiological procedure, one may expect from such a study additional 
information on the nature of the emotional process itself.

Wolpe's experiments and therapeutic work lie in this area. He showed 
convincingly that anxiety is a learned (conditioned) reaction and 
is the basis of experimental and clinical neuroses and assumed, therefore, 
that the neuronal changes which underlie the neuroses are functional 
and reversible. An important observation of Pavlov served as a 
guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological means. In 
a conditioning experiment, he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding 
and pain. A mild electrical shock served as a conditioned stimulus 
and was followed by feeding. The pain became thus the symbol for food 
and elicited salivary secretion (conditioned reflex). Even when the 
intensity of the shocks was increased gradually, it failed to evoke 
any signs of pain. Since strong nociceptive stimuli produce an experimental 
neurosis during which the animals fail to eat in the experimental 
situation, Wolpe thought that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism 
to inhibit the neurotic symptoms through feeding. Appropriate 
experiments showed that this is, indeed, possible. He then applied 
this 
principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neuroses. He took advantage 
of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety 
and found a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former 
attitude was established.   For the interpretation of these significant 
investigations, it should be remembered that reciprocal relations 
exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic functions 
which are closely associated with the emotions. The feeding-pain 
antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation between the 
tropho- and ergotropic systems. Furthermore, a functional antagonism 
exists between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety. Although 
in both emotions sympathetic symptoms are present, different autonomic-somatic 
patterns underlie aggression and anxiety, respectively, 
as indicated by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamines, the state 
of the muscle tone, and the Mecholyl test. The psychological incompatibility 
of these emotional states seems to be reflected in, or based 
on, this marked difference. #/15,. CONCLUDING REMARKS#

In 
our attempt to interpret the emotions in their physiological and pathological 
range, we emphasized the importance of the degree of activity 
of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions of the hypothalamic system 
and their influence on the inhibitory and excitatory systems, respectively. 
We stressed the reciprocal relation of these systems with 
respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge as well as regarding 
the hypothalamic-cortical discharge. Although we are still far from 
a complete understanding of these problems, as a first approximation, 
it is suggested that alterations in the hypothalamic balance with consequent 
changes in the hypothalamic-cortical discharges account for 
major changes in behavior seen in various moods and states of emotions 
in man and beast under physiological circumstances, in experimental and 
clinical neurosis, and as the result of psychopharmacological agents. 
In view of the important role which emotional disturbances play in 
the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorders and the parallelism 
observed between autonomic states and psychological behavior in several 
instances, it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance may 
play an important role in initiating mental changes. 

#6.4. THE PRIMARY DECOMPOSITION THEOREM#

We are trying to study a 
linear operator ~<T> on the finite-dimensional space ~<V>, 
by decomposing ~<T> into a direct sum of operators which are in some 
sense elementary. We can do this through the characteristic values 
and vectors of ~<T> in certain special cases, i&e&, when the 
minimal polynomial for ~<T> factors over the scalar field ~<F> 
into a product of distinct monic polynomials of degree 1. What can 
we do with the general ~<T>? If we try to study ~<T> using 
characteristic values, we are confronted with two problems. First, 
~<T> may not have a single characteristic value; this is really 
a deficiency in the scalar field, namely, that it is not algebraically 
closed. Second, even if the characteristic polynomial factors completely 
over ~<F> into a product of polynomials of degree 1, there 
may not be enough characteristic vectors for ~<T> to span the 
space ~<V>; this is clearly a deficiency in ~<T>. The second 
situation is illustrated by the operator ~<T> on **f (~<F> 
any field) represented in the standard basis by **f. The characteristic 
polynomial for ~<A> is **f and this is plainly also the minimal 
polynomial for ~<A> (or for ~<T>). Thus ~<T> is not 
diagonalizable. One sees that this happens because the null space of 
**f has dimension 1 only. On the other hand, the null space of **f and 
the null space of **f together span ~<V>, the former being the 
subspace spanned by **f and the latter the subspace spanned by **f and 
**f.   This will be more or less our general method for the second 
problem. If (remember this is an assumption) the minimal polynomial 
for ~<T> decomposes **f where **f are distinct elements of ~<F>, 
then we shall show that the space ~<V> is the direct sum 
of the null spaces of **f. The diagonalizable operator is the special 
case of this in which **f for each ~<i>. The theorem which we prove 
is more general than what we have described, since it works with the 
primary decomposition of the minimal polynomial, whether or not the primes 
which enter are all of first degree. The reader will find it helpful 
to think of the special case when the primes are of degree 1, and 
even more particularly, to think of the proof of Theorem 10, a special 
case of this theorem. 

#THEOREM 12. (PRIMARY DECOMPOSITION THEOREM).# 
<Let> ~T <be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional 
vector space> ~V <over the field> ~F. <Let> ~p <be the 
minimal polynomial for> ~T, **f <where the **f are distinct irreducible 
monic polynomials over> ~F <and the **f are positive integers. 
Let **f be the null space of **f. Then> (a) **f (b) <each **f 
is invariant under> ~T (c) <if **f is the operator induced on 
**f by> ~T, 
<then the minimal polynomial for **f is **f.> _PROOF._ 
The idea of the proof is this. If the direct-sum decomposition 
(a) is valid, how can we get hold of the projections **f associated with 
the decomposition? The projection **f will be the identity on **f 
and zero on the other **f. We shall find a polynomial **f such that 
**f is the identity on **f and is zero on the other **f, and so that 
**f, etc&.   For each ~<i>, let **f. Since **f are distinct 
prime polynomials, the polynomials **f are relatively prime (Theorem 
8, Chapter 4). Thus there are polynomials **f such that **f. Note 
also that if **f, then **f is divisible by the polynomial ~<p>, 
because **f contains each **f as a factor. We shall show that the polynomials 
**f behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of 
the proof.   Let **f. Since **f and ~<p> divides **f for **f, 
we have **f. Thus the **f are projections which correspond to some 
direct-sum decomposition of the space ~<V>. We wish to show that 
the range of **f is exactly the subspace **f. It is clear that each 
vector in the range of **f is in **f for if ~|a is in the range of 
**f, then **f and so **f because **f is divisible by the minimal polynomial 
~<p>. Conversely, suppose that ~|a is in the null space 
of **f. If **f, then **f is divisible by **f and so **f, i&e&, 
**f. But then it is immediate that **f, i&e&, that ~|a is in
