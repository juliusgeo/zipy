desire. The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience 
a premature climax. This is a very common experience and should in 
no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.   Or the 
frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of 
the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him 
to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period. The signals 
to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to 
take advantage of them.   The best course is to recover his physical 
excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again. This 
may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding 
and self-centered. He can take security from the fact that the 
progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost. 
Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses from her, his bride 
will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him 
restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they 
both so eagerly desire.   A final word. The accumulated information 
on this point shows that first intercourse, even when it is achieved 
with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom an overwhelming sexual 
experience to a woman. Too many new things are happening for it to 
be a complete erotic fulfillment.   Only under rare circumstances 
would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse. Both 
man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax, and 
even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that 
the wife may be cold or frigid.   If the early approaches are wise, 
understanding and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment 
will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.

WRITING in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures, 
titled <The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form,> Kenneth 
Clark declares: "**h The human body, as a nucleus, is rich in associations. 
**h It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things 
we wish to do with ourselves".   Perhaps this is a clue to 
the amazing variety and power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated 
by the nude form.   The wide divergence of reactions 
is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality. 
Differences were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds. 
Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt 
to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated beyond the eighth 
grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.

Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating 
thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that 
her husband had "never seen her entirely naked", while another woman, 
boasting an equal number of years of married life, is proud of having 
"shared the nudist way of life- the really free, natural nude 
life- for most of that period".   Attempts at censorship always 
involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions. 
The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude 
human form as "lewd 
and pornographic, a threat and danger" to all the young, or good, 
or religious, or moral persons.   The equally ardent proponent 
of 
freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the 
"natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and the epitome 
of beauty and inspiration".   One is always a little surprised 
to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected. I 
still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic 
advocate of the "clean, healthful, free way of natural life 
in nudism", who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution 
in fine spirit.

@ IN TRADITION and in poetry, the marriage bed is a place 
of unity and harmony. The partners each bring to it unselfish love, 
and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.   At its 
most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly 
cares. Everything else is closed away.   This is the ideal. 
But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy 
are seldom achieved. Instead one partner or the other dominates the 
sexual relationship. In the past, it has been the husband who has been 
dominant and the wife passive. But today there are signs that these 
roles are being reversed.   In a growing number of American homes, 
marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role 
in sexual relationships. It is she who decides the time, the place, 
the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act. It is she who 
says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics- 
not the husband. The whole act is tailored to <her> pleasure, 
and not to <theirs>.   Beyond a certain point, of course, 
no woman can be dominant- nature has seen to that. But there is little 
doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.

Of course, there remain many "old-fashioned" marriages in 
which the husband maintains his supremacy. Yet even in these marriages, 
psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly. The 
meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's 
or grandmother's standards.   To many experts, this trend was 
inevitable. They consider it simply a sign of our times. Our society 
has "emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence and new 
authority. It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual 
role.   "The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum", 
declares Dr& Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director of the 
Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent 
book, <Release From Sexual Tensions>. "It reflects what is going 
on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself. A world 
in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual 
relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too".

Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination 
of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy 
and even dangerous. It can, in fact, wreck a marriage.   When 
a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she 
is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her. 
And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy. 
On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his self-respect, 
and robs him of his masculinity. He is a target of ridicule 
to his wife, and often- since private affairs rarely remain private- 
to the outside world as well.   "A marriage can survive almost 
any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's 
maleness", declares Dr& Calderone. This opinion is supported 
by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, Dr& Maurice 
E& Linden, director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia 
Department of Public Health.   "When the roles of 
husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the 
husband follower", Dr& Linden says, "the effects on their whole 
relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous". ## 

IN ONE EXTREME case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office 
worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband 
unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded. To win her favors, her 
husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle 
from his employer. Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison. While 
he was in custody his wife divorced him.   More typical is 
the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage 
counselor. This woman repeatedly complained she was "too tired" 
for marital relations. To please her, her husband assumed some of the 
domestic chores. Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the 
children, and even ironing- and still his wife refused to have relations 
as often as he desired them.   One wife, described by a 
New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed 
their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between 
the weekly ~PTA meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood 
card parties. Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis. After 
every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the 
matter was settled in her favor.   Experts say the partners in 
marriages like these can almost be typed.   The wife is likely 
to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip- often a girl who has sacrificed 
a promising career for marriage. She knows the power of the 
sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.   The husband 
is usually a well-educated professional, preoccupied with his job- 
often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is: "Don't 
rock the boat".   Sometimes this leads to his becoming 
demandingly dominant in marriage. Hemmed in on the job and unable to 
assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one 
area.   More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting 
to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule 
at home.   Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound 
husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their 
wives. The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend, 
is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay 
as much attention to her as he does to his job.   Naturally no 
woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative. Unless her 
husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated. Generally, 
however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's 
mercy.   "The pattern", says Dr& Morton 
Schillinger, 
psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy, 
"is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually 
trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight 
is the night".   No one seriously contends, of course, that 
the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world. 
After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic 
figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as Dr& Schillinger 
points out. There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts 
became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master 
bedroom. ##

FURTHERMORE, Dr& Calderone says, a certain 
number of docile, retiring men always have been around. They aren't 
"frigid" and they aren't homosexual; they're just restrained 
in all of life. They <like> to be dominated. One such man once 
confided to Dr& Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he 
preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor. Asked why, he replied 
primly: "Because that's no activity for a gentleman".

But such cases were, in the past, unusual. Society here and abroad 
has been built around the dominating male- even the Bible appears 
to endorse the concept.   Family survival on our own Western frontier, 
for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength 
and ability to bring home the bacon; and the dependent wife seldom 
questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed.

This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 
20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring 
<Life With Father> manner.   In those days, a wife had mighty 
few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere. 
"Grandma wasn't expected to like it", Dr& Marion Hilliard, 
the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the 
'90s. Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as 
"used" by their husbands- and, history indicates, they often quite 
literally were.   When was the turning point? When did women 
begin to assert themselves sexually? ##

SOME DATE IT from 
woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men 
in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper 
and bathtub gin. Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend 
toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with 
the postwar rush to the suburbs.   Left alone while her husband 
was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties 
normally reserved for the male. Circumstances gave her almost undisputed 
sway over child-rearing, money-handling and home maintenance.
