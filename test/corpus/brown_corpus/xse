into his pocket. Yes, there was the key.   "Are you positive 
you'll be all right by yourself"? she asked him.   For a 
moment he smiled. "Yes, Julie dear. You've done me the greatest 
possible service. By myself I'll be fine".   "Take care 
of yourself then".   "I will **h. you, also **h. don't work 
too hard".   It was an automatic phrase; as he crossed through 
the courtyard he regretted it. He should have discovered a more 
tender farewell. Someone shouted at him, "Well! Will you look 
at George Rawlings! What happened to you"?   "I bumped 
into a door handle", George said.   Someone laughed. George 
walked steadily ahead into his entry. His bandages seemed on fire. 
He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it. In the kitchenette 
the raw whiskey made him gasp. Just one or two swallows, he 
told himself, enough to lessen some of the pain.   He was telephoning. 
"No, Millie, I'm home **h. No, really, right as rain 
**h. Tell Sam not to worry about the car. I'll get it hauled away 
**h. 
No, please- no visit today- I'll be asleep **h. For God's 
sake, don't worry. That upsets me more than anything **h. Yes, 
sure, 
I'll see the doctor- this evening, if you insist **h". 
There was one more call to make.   "Joan, did I wake you"? 
he asked. "Yes, I thought you'd probably be up **h. Look, 
sweetheart, 
some fool was **h. happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated 
last night. Unfortunately it turned out to be me, but I wouldn't 
quite put it that way to the boss **h. Oh hell no, I'm not in a 
hospital. 
I won't be in town for a couple of days, though, and there's 
that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon. Too bad a jury 
isn't involved. I might struggle in for a jury. I'd win hands down. 
But I thought maybe Tony Elliott could pinch-hit for me. He'll 
understand- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge. He's 
got all the facts. I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement- it's 
really just a routine thing **h. What? **h No, darling I'd 
rather 
you didn't come out". A smile pulled at the lower strip of 
adhesive tape. "Don't even send flowers. I'll see you Wednesday. 
I'll bribe you with a nice"- He was about to say "double 
martini" but thought better of it. "I'll take you out to dinner. 
Okay? **h"

He had put down the receiver. A strange relationship 
between Joan Fulbright and himself. Who knew about it? 
She lived alone in the older part of the city, in one of those renovated 
houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed. She 
had two tiny rooms on the second floor. She was a clever girl, a most 
efficient secretary. She let him come and go as he pleased, or as 
it pleased her. In the office you might have thought them only casual 
friends; yet 
if he said: Make an excuse yourself, come out here today, 
she would have been on the next train- and, similarly, if she had 
been in need, he would have gone to her. 
"They make us conformists look good".   "That's a peculiar 
way to think". It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled 
her own feathers, of course; she knew that. It was Jim's "little" 
sister Myra, the unreliable, irresponsible, forever flyaway, 
Myra. She's a year older than I am, Lucy told herself.

"Come, come", Jim said, jollying Lucy a little. "I love you. 
Susan ready"?   Lucy listened. Obviously, Susan was not. 
Upstairs, busy feet, showering like raindrops, pattered around her 
room. Susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days, but 
even at seven she was a prudent soul; she always packed for a lifetime, 
just in case. "Not yet. Every doll in the house must be going 
with her".   "She'd better step on it. It's a long way 
to Websterville". Jim's fine young face was an expressive one, 
too; as he looked at her, it registered anxiety. "You know", 
he said. "Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy. It'll be 
only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris- 
but even so, she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful".

Lucy did not believe him; Myra appreciated nothing. Jim had 
put the thanks in his sister's mouth.   "Darling"- she 
said, and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend. 
"She should have told me herself. And <will> it be only a 
couple of weeks? Remember what happened the last time"? 
Leaving Cathy with them, Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly 
brief visit; but she had stayed all winter, and Cathy had stayed 
all winter too- with them. Lucy suspected that Myra would never 
have come home if Gregg, Myra's husband, hadn't gone out to 
fetch her. "That was an awfully <long> two weeks". ##

FOR 
an otherwise silent moment, Jim's keys jingled nervously in his 
pocket. "But she promised- This will be different", he said 
at last. "You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine 
government job over there- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy 
in no time. You'll see, Myra's settling down". On the defensive, 
he added, "I wish you'd think what it must be like for her 
to be without Greg, to be a new widow, a young widow".   "It 
depends on the widow". Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it. And 
not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down. It 
seemed to Lucy that all their married life, she and Jim had been doing 
nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her 
way of life. Remembering that succession of disasters, she now considered 
Cathy, an ominous child-cloud on her horizon.   It was 
not that she disliked Cathy. The youngster drew her, troubled her depths; 
whenever Lucy saw her, she tried, without noise or fuss, to give 
her the warmth she had never had from Myra. But Cathy was Myra's 
responsibility, not hers.   "I wouldn't even be surprised", 
she said unhappily, "if Myra tried to leave her with us forever". 
Myra loved big cities; thousands of miles away- in Paris, 
of all places- she might forget she had ever been a mother. Lucy 
knew her too well to find it impossible.   "That's a horrible 
thing to accuse her of"! Jim was so indignant it was obvious that 
no matter what he said, he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy. 
He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up, fiercely, 
"Susan! Susan! Get moving"!   A startled piping 
sound returned.   "Don't yell at <us>", Lucy said. Was 
it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front 
of the house looking at the moon-washed river? Their arms around 
each other, they had been talking of the present and the future; 
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm, as steeped in 
light, as the air around them. Then, from within the still, sleeping 
house, the telephone had rung; Myra, with her news, was on the other 
end of the line.   Jim turned back from the stairway and looked 
at her. His dark brows, which had been lowered in anger, smoothed. 
"Please", he said. "There isn't a chance of Myra's letting 
anything like that happen. Let's stay friends".   But they 
weren't just friends, Lucy thought; they were husband and wife, 
and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage. The only 
thing that had ever come between them was that worthless, selfish sister 
of his. Lucy was sick of it.   "Well, at last", she said, 
because Susan was clattering down the stairs. ##

SUSAN 
looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse; her arms were straining with 
a burden of dolls. "I'm ready", she announced.   "Do you 
need that big bundle"? Jim said. His voice had sharp edges, as 
though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment. 
"All that junk"?   Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes 
that gushed an instant grief; to her, each of her dolls was a real 
person with a living heart.   "Now, now", Lucy said, approaching 
Susan with a handkerchief, mopping skillfully. "Your father 
didn't mean it, Susan". She gave Jim a quick, shape-up look of 
warning. "He'll take every one of them".   Jim groaned, 
but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said, in a gentler tone, "Sure- 
the entire thousand. And when you get back from Grandma's, Cathy 
will be here to play with you. Nice"?   "No", Susan 
said, grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like 
effect.   And at this point, Lucy thought, there should be 
a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls- but she could sympathize 
with Susan; there ought to be a limit to sharing, too. 
That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit, 
short or long; the last one had been a Lilliputian war. She suspected 
that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she 
had never had.   "Well", Jim said, out of the silence, "let's 
get going, dolls and all".   When the car, with Susan's 
hands waving wildly from the rear window, disappeared down the 
driveway, Lucy stood looking after its pale dust. The day was brilliant 
around her- flower-scented, crisp with breeze- yet her inner turmoil 
darkened it. She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by, a chillier 
kiss. She was sorry, and angry at herself, because never in their 
life together had she done that. She turned and began to walk toward 
the house.   At the feeding station, the raffish group of cowbirds 
again bobbed and gobbled over the ground, but now, gorgeous among 
them, was a beautiful red cardinal, radiant in its feathered vestments. 
The handsome bird was solitary; its mate must be at home, silently 
guarding their nest. She had better stay there, Lucy thought; the 
sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels.

Well, Lucy? she said to herself, abandoning the cardinals 
and the cowbirds. She had a day of things to do; among them, she 
had to prepare the guest room. How long would it be occupied? she 
wondered, with a baffled feeling of helplessness. As long as the unscrupulous 
Myra chose? For a moment, her mind returned again to the 
strange, flying world of birds, and she said to herself. It isn't 
only birds that dump their children in other people's nests **h.

In the sunshine of late afternoon, Lucy stood looking at the ready 
guest room. There were new yellow curtains, bright as a child's 
life ought to be, a new bedspread, lively with hopping rabbits, and hanging 
from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile, spinning slowly 
in the breeze. A row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes 
in the neatly empty closet; since Myra had always put most of 
Greg's money on her own back, Lucy suspected that no more than a 
few of that long row would be needed. The closet was faintly fragrant 
with lavender, and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into 
her mind, like a lavender ghost: Greg's house, on the day he 
was buried, and the child, pale, silent, baffled, watching the funeral 
guests with panicky eyes. Many times since his death that memory had 
worried and troubled her.   Out in the hall, the upstairs phone 
shrilled, and the small ghost vanished. When she picked up the receiver, 
her mother's cheerful voice was there.   "Websterville 
Junction calling", she said. "I just thought I'd let you know. 
Myra dropped Cathy this morning, and Jim picked Cathy up and left 
Susan a few hours ago. I'd have phoned sooner but I've been 
busy".   "I can imagine"! Susan was an active character; 
for Mother to be able to call, Susan must be napping now, surrounded 
by her multitude of dolls. Lucy drew out the chair and sat down; 
she relaxed a little, and some of the tension went out of her. You 
could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah, yet the maternal voice 
still kept its comforting magic. "How was Cathy"?   "Subdued. 
But Myra was the merriest widow I ever saw".   On 
her way to the airport, on her way to Paris- you bet, Lucy said 
to herself. "I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy".

There was a momentary pause, and then her mother said, "How long 
is she supposed to stay"?   "Just for a couple of weeks,
