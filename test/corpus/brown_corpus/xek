could do for him.   Well, sir **h they did real great! For 
in almost less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight was 
increasing rapidly. Of course he did some exercising **h he's crazy 
about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction 
with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle 
on his skinny frame.   Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming 
and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much. 
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body. It was muscular 
but it wasn't symmetrical. "A real 'nothing' torso", says 
Henri. "It never seemed to widen **h it just got longer and longer".

That's when he went to Professor Claude. And at 
once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct 
it. In his gym the professor has some of the most "knocked out" equipment 
since Vic Tanny. Mr& Claude is a specialist in torso development 
and he has long favored the now-famous Weider {Push-Pull 
Super-Set} technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is 
a {pressing} or "pushing" movement which accents one sector of 
a muscle group in a specific way, followed by a "pulling" exercise 
which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.   So 
right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous "moon" bench 
and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting 
of the wide-grip Straight-Arm Pullover (the "pull" part of the 
Push-Pull Super-Set) which dramatically widens the ribcage and 
strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest **h and the 
collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to 
build those wide, Reeves-type "gladiator" ~pecs, while stimulating 
the upper ~lats and frontal deltoids.   As you can see, 
in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is 
vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises **h so 
the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time!   Now when 
Henri has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 1, 
the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting 
him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No& 2.   Super-Set 
No& 2 is made up of similar exercises, but this time done 
with dumbbells, and using both "moon" and flat benches. The "push" 
exercise of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press done 
with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of 
the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation. You need the 
barbell variation to build width and mass in the ~pecs **h the dumbbell 
variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the ~pecs.

The "pull" exercise in this Super-Set is the one-dumbbell 
Bent-Arm Pullover. 
(Note how strongly 
the upper ~lats and serratus are worked in this fine exercise 
because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation 
affords).   In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the "push" 
exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the "pull" 
exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms.

The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage 
stretcher ever invented! This is true {only} if a very wide grip 
is used and {only} when the {greatest possible stretch} is 
achieved. You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because 
your shoulder blades will touch! As you see, the professor has designed 
a piece of apparatus that {forces} the bodybuilder to use 
a w-i-d-e grip **h he has to; he just can't do anything about it at 
all!   But as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise 
at all, because Henri de Courcy- the "happy" bodybuilder- 
looks as though he were having the time of his life!   The last 
exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single 
exercise, done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between 
sets. By this time Henri's entire chest-back-~lat-shoulder area 
is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to 
do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work. He has Henri do 
from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press (note the high incline). 
This gives a wide flare to the ~pecs, causing them to flow 
dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the 
serratus and ~lats.   This is the kind of chest that invariably 
wins contests **h that steel-edged "carved-out-of-solid rock" looks 
of the great champions.   So with four complete Push-Pull 
Super-Sets No& 1, four of No& 2, four of No& 3 and four to 
six sets of the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri de Courcy 
has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping, torso-defining 
workout that cannot be improved upon. 
@   Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone **h 
rarer still is a <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> of true Herculean 
build. The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' 
eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry 
and that hallmark of the true champion- <superior definition> 
of the muscles.

Now <good> definition is one thing that all of us can 
acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight workouts. 
But <contest> definition- that dramatic muscular separation of every 
muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's 
chisel- is something quite different. This comes not alone 
from high-set, high-rep training, but from certain definition-specialization 
exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge 
of exactly what works best for <him>.   Often these exercises 
work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others. 
Because they are "minority" exercises and have but a limited 
appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten. Only 
when the newest <Mr& America> or <Mr& Universe> rediscovers 
them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and 
once again see how effective they really are.   The exercise I 
shall discuss in this- the first of a new series of articles on muscle 
definition-specialization of a particular body part- is the One 
Leg Lunge. Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say 
because it works perfectly for <everyone>, no matter whether he has 
short or long thigh-bone lengths!   It is the one exercise 
that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the {hipline}- 
that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other 
bodybuilders **h a criterion of muscle "drama" that is unforgettable 
to judges and audiences alike **h the facet of muscular development 
that wins prizes.   Definition of the thighs at the uppermost 
part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which 
is easily understandable. The One Leg Lunge is a {split} and 
all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.   But for 
purely definition purposes- used in conjunction with your regular 
Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor programs- a heavy weight is 
not needed. Indeed, a lighter weight works much better because a greater, 
more extensive split can be performed. Used in several sets of 
high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire 
upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look 
like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin!   Really 
there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way 
into your leg program at all times, for the following suggestions show 
why it is so effective: _1._ It's a {complete} thigh contraction-extension 
exercise. _2._ It places terrific tension on 
the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition. _3._ It 
improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder, and helps 
to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed. _4._ It 
increases flexibility of the legs. _5._ It speeds muscle growth 
and power development even for the {advanced} bodybuilder because 
each hip and leg is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated 
effort to be focused on each.   You'll need your Weider 
Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's 
done: _1._ Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their 
height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders 
when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean. _2._ Place 
a suitably-loaded barbell across them; grasp the bar (which will 
rest against the back of your neck); extend your feet forward and 
backward until you are in a deep leg split.   Now raise the weight 
by {straightening} your {front} leg, {without moving your 
feet}. When the front knee is straight and {locked}, allow it 
to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the 
sides of the Power Stands. _3._ After you have taken a breather, 
{reverse} the position of your legs so that the {front} thigh 
of the {previous} exercise is now to the {rear}, and the 
{rear} thigh now to the {front}, and perform the same movement 
in the same manner.   That's the One-Leg Lunge in a nutshell. 
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you 
make your first 
experiments **h just for safety. You should also begin 
this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed 
to it balance-wise.   Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit 
at first. But don't worry. Before your first training experiment 
has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it 
you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran!

Although I suggested that you hold the bar at the {back} of 
the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments 
with the bar held in {front} of the neck. Squat-style lifters and 
leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those 
variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the 
{left} and {right} leg to the {front}.

THE MOST BEAUTIFUL bed of pansies I've seen was in a South 
Dakota yard on a sizzling day. Pansies are supposed to like it 
cool, but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring 
sun. I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce 
such beauties in that weather. He seemed puzzled by my question. 
"I just love them", he said.   The more I talked with him, 
the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous 
blooming. Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care. 
He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from a pansy specialist. 
These specialists, I learned, have done a great deal of work to 
improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers. Their 
seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the 
unimproved strains.   I asked him if he took seeds from his own 
plants. Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he wanted 
more of he did; but pansy seeds, he told me, soon "run down". It's 
best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.

His soil was "nothing special", just prairie land, but 
he had harrowed in compost until it was loose, spongy and brown-black. 
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the 
right texture, tilth and body. It isn't easy to describe it, but every 
gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.   Nothing 
is easier to grow from seed than pansies. They germinate quickly, the 
tiny plants appearing in a week, and grow along lustily. It doesn't 
really matter which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate 
best when they have a wide variation of temperature, very warm followed 
by cool in the same 24 hours.   I like to make a seedbed 
right in the open, though many people start them successfully in cold 
frames. Pansies don't have to be coddled; they'd rather have things 
rugged, with only moderate protection on the coldest days. If you 
do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.

For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to 
encourage rooting. I dig it, rake it smooth, sow the seeds and wet them 
down with a fog spray. Then I cover the sowing with a board. This 
keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds. Ants carry away 
the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.

When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board. A 
light, porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft 
during these early days of growth. I like sawdust for this, or hay.
