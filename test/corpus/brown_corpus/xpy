was"?   "The past I leave to historians", Felix intoned, 
demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy.   "You 
live in the present"?   "In the present", Felix proclaimed. 
"For the future. Is there any other time in which a man 
can live"?   "We", Gibby announced, "are not philosophers. 
We are Assistant District Attorneys. This gentleman is a police 
officer. He is a fingerprint specialist. Could your future, your 
immediate future, be made to include taking us upstairs, giving us a 
bit of space in which our friend can work, and making available to him 
your finger tips"?   The happy one could never have looked 
happier. This was more than joy. It was ecstasy.   "Those lovely 
whorls", he chortled. "So intricate, so beautiful. Come right 
along. I love fingerprints".   He was prancing along the 
hall, heading for the next flight of stairs.   Gibby called him 
back. "We're here because of what happened last night", he said. 
"Past, yes, but important. Since it is important, for the record 
let's have the full name".   "That important"? Felix 
asked.   "That important".   "Grubb", Felix whispered.

"Felix Grubb"? Gibby asked, not bothering to whisper.

"Shh", Felix implored. "I can't see what would 
make it necessary for you to know. Nothing could make it necessary 
to proclaim it to the whole world".   Obligingly Gibby lowered 
his voice. "Felix Grubb"? he repeated. "No. Edmund, but 
not for years. For years it's been just Felix. First thing I did 
after my twenty-first birthday was go into court and have it officially 
changed, and this is something I don't tell everybody. That was 
almost forty years ago".   Having volunteered that he was a man 
of about sixty, he bounded up the stairs and with each leap rendered 
the number less credible. This was a broth of a boy, our Felix, and 
nothing was more obvious than the joy he took in demonstrating how agile 
he was and how full of juice and spirit. We followed him up the 
stairs. The cops would gather up Connor and the foursome on the third 
floor and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting.

You may think we didn't need Nancy and Jean, 
but you always get what you can when you can, and we had no guarantee 
that a fingerprint record on them couldn't be useful before we were 
through with this case. Also, if we had excluded the ladies we would 
have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where 
we stood. The killer, if in our present group, would certainly be 
interested in knowing that much, and even though with the fingerprint 
evidence what it was I could see no way he could use this bit of information 
to improve on his situation, there might always be some way. If 
you can possibly avoid it, you don't hand out any extra chances.

Felix took us into his studio. It was that oddly shaped space 
at the very top of the house, where ceiling heights had to accommodate 
themselves to the varying angles of roof slope. At each angle of its 
pitch a big skylight had been fitted into the roof and all these skylights 
were fitted with systems of multiple screens and shades. 
When Felix first opened the door on it, all these shades were tightly 
drawn and the whole studio was as dark as night. He quickly fixed 
that, rolling back the shades on some of the skylights and adjusting screens 
on the others. He flew about the place making these adjustments 
and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit of long experience. 
None of his movements was tentative. There was no process of 
trial and error. Starting with the room completely blacked out, as it 
was when we came in, he unerringly fixed things so that the whole place 
was bathed in the maximum of light without at any point admitting 
even so much as a crack of glare.   Expecting something more-than-average 
wacky, I was surprised by what we found. There was no display 
of either works in progress or of finished work. Here and there on 
work table or pedestal stood a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin draped 
over it. These shapes might have been mad, but there was no telling. 
They were all completely shrouded. The equipment was solid and heavy 
and in good condition. Everything was orderly and it seemed to be 
arranged for the workman's comfort, convenience and efficiency. There 
were tools about but they were neatly kept. There was no confusion 
and no litter. Supplies of sheet metal were neatly stacked in bins. 
ANDY DID NOT SEE the newspapers the next day. Someone on his staff- 
he suspected it was Ed Thornburg- intercepted them and for 
this Andy was grateful.   He finally fell asleep around six in 
the morning with the aid of a sleeping capsule, a crutch he rarely used, 
and didn't awaken until early afternoon. Memory flooded him the 
instant he opened his eyes and the sick feeling knotted his stomach.

Outside his window bloomed a beautiful summer day. Presumably 
the same sun was shining upon little Drew also, and those who had kidnapped 
him. But where? It was still a very big world, despite all 
the modern cant to the contrary.   Hub was sitting in a chair that 
blocked the hall door. He was dozing, perhaps the only sleep he'd 
gotten. He snapped to alertness at Andy's entrance. "Sorry, 
Mr& Paxton. Nothing new. Lot of people waiting to see you, though".

"Reporters"?   "Our own people. Questions 
about the show tonight". Hub picked up the telephone. "Shall I 
let them know you're awake"?   "I suppose. How's Lissa, 
do you know"?   Hub considered. "Some better. She's 
got plenty of guts, Mr& Paxton. You want me to call her"?

"She expecting me to"? Hub shook his head so Andy told 
him not to bother. The only reason for contacting Lissa was to comfort 
or to be comforted. He could not manage the former or expect the 
latter; they had nothing to give to each other. The omission might 
look peculiar to outsiders, but Andy could not bring himself to go through 
the motions simply for the sake of appearances.   He had little 
time to himself, anyway. As the afternoon sped toward evening, 
the suite saw a steady procession of Paxton aides pass in and out, each 
with his own special problem. Thornburg arrived with the writers. 
They had spent the morning revising the act, eliminating all the gay 
songs, patter and dancing with a view of the best public relations. What 
remained lacked the original verve but it was at least dignified, 
as befitting the tragic circumstances. Raymond Fox reported that the 
orchestra had hastily rehearsed "Cradle Song" in case it was needed. 
Charlie Marble was back and forth on several occasions, first 
to confer with Andy on the advisability of cancelling the Las Vegas 
engagement- they decided it was wise- and later to announce that 
a prominent comedian, also an agency client, had agreed to fill the casino's 
open date. And once Bake slipped in, pale and drawn, last 
night's liquor still on his breath with some of today's added to it. 
He asked if there was anything he could do. Andy invented a job to 
keep him busy, sending him ahead to El Dorado to supervise last minute 
arrangements.   But from Rocco Vecchio, they heard nothing.

At last it was time to depart. Hub, nosing about, spotted 
reporters in the lobby, so Andy was hustled away quietly through the 
hotel's service entrance in a strange car which Hub had procured somewhere.

They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel, but 
there was no chance of avoiding them at the nightclub. El Dorado 
was surrounded by a mob. They overflowed the parking lot, making progress 
by automobile difficult. Long before he reached the protection of 
the stage door, Andy was recognized. Word of his arrival spread through 
the crowd like a brushfire. They surged around him, fingers pointing, 
eyes prying. It was not a hostile gathering but Andy sensed the 
difference from last night's hero-worshippers. They had come not 
to admire but to observe.   "It's worse inside", Thornburg 
informed Andy. "Skolman's jammed in every table he could find. 
Under the heading of it's an ill wind, et cetera".   Backstage 
was tomblike by contrast. Andy's co-workers kept their distance, 
awed by the tragedy. But in his dressing room was a large bouquet 
and a card that read, "We're with you all the way". It was signed 
by everyone in the troupe. Andy couldn't help but be touched. 
He instructed Shirl Winter to compose a note of thanks to be posted 
on the call board.   Bake was waiting to report that Lou DuVol 
had been sobered up to the point where he could function efficiently. 
Andy gathered that this had been no small accomplishment. Bake himself 
looked better; any kind of job was better than brooding.

Andy told him, "Bake, I wish you'd talk to Skolman, see if 
some kind of p& a& system can be rigged up outside. It's just barely 
possible with this crowd that the kidnapper wasn't able to get 
a table. I wouldn't want him to miss the message".   "I'll 
try. Skolman isn't going to like it much, though, giving away 
what he should be selling".   Skolman wasn't the only one who 
didn't care for Andy's scheme. A short time later, Lieutenant 
Bonner stomped into the dressing room. "I got a bone to pick with 
you, Mr& Paxton. It's those damn loudspeakers".   Andy 
rolled up the revised script he had been studying. "What about them"?

"They're going to louse me up good. My men have been 
here all afternoon, setting up for this thing". Bonner explained 
that, with the nightclub's cooperation, the police had occupied El 
Dorado like a battlefield. Motion picture cameras had been installed 
to film the audience, the reservation list was being checked out name 
by name, and a special detail was already at work in the parking lot 
scrutinizing automobiles for a possible lead. However, it was virtually 
impossible to screen the mob outside, even if Bonner had manpower 
available for the purpose. "I want you to have the speakers taken 
out".   Andy sighed. "Seems like we're never going to see 
eye to eye, Lieutenant. Didn't they tell you what I wanted the p& 
a& system for"?   "Sure, I know. But it's such a 
long shot"-   "No longer than yours. What do you expect 
to get tonight, anyway? You think somebody is going to stand up in 
the audience and make guilty faces? Or have a sign on his car that 
says, 'Here 
Comes the Paxton Kidnapper'"? Andy crumbled the 
script in his fist. "I can't stop you from doing what you think 
is right. But don't try to stop me, either".   "Someday", 
Bonner said, "you're going to ask us for help. I can hardly 
wait".   "What you don't understand is that I'm asking 
for it now".   But Bonner departed, still full of ill will. He 
had gotten stuck with a job too big for his imagination; he had to 
cling to routine, tested procedures. To act otherwise would be to admit 
his helplessness. But, admit or not, Bonner was helpless. The 
crime showed too much planning, the kidnappers appeared too proficient 
to be caught by a checklist.   Andy's performance was scheduled 
for eleven o'clock. He stalled for a half-hour longer, hoping to 
hear something from Vecchio about the ransom money. Bake and Shirl 
Winter, on separate telephones, could not reach him at any conceivable 
location in Los Angeles, nor could they secure any clear-cut information 
regarding his efforts.   Bake cursed. "The sweaty bastard's 
probably halfway to Peru with our money by now". When no one 
smiled, he felt constrained to add, "Just kidding, natch".

Thornburg popped in to advise, "Andy, Skolman's sending up 
smoke signals. You about ready"?   "What's he complaining 
about"? Bake asked. "They're drinking, aren't they"?

"No. We got a bunch of sippers out there tonight. I guess 
nobody wants to pass out and miss anything". Thornburg added in a 
lower voice but Andy overheard, "They act more like a jury than an 
audience".   Andy said, "Well, I guess we can't wait any 
longer. Hub, you stick by the stage door. If Rock shows up during 
the number- or you hear anything- give me the signal". 
Shirl Winter said, "I'll stay on the phone, Mr& Paxton. There's 
a couple of call-backs I can work on".   "You're 
a sweetheart- but leave one line open. He may try to phone us". Andy
