overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating 
traffic. An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf 
rolling in on a beach. A site may also be attractive just through 
the beauty of its trees and shrubs. Note extent of these interests and 
how available they will be for the public to enjoy.   Water interest 
is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation 
site. Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas. 
This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake 
provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation 
activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water sports. 
A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract 
the greatest picnic and camping use. It also cools the air in summer 
and nourishes the trees and wild life.   The amount of water 
frontage, the quantity and quality of the water, and the recreation 
afforded by it are important. A restricted frontage may be too crowded 
an area for public use. The quantity of water flow may be critical; 
a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant 
or dry in late summer. If the site is on a reservoir, the level 
of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be 
studied. Check the quality of the water. A stream which has all of 
its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation 
practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one 
passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area. Other 
factors, such as water temperature, depth of water, the fish life it 
supports, wave action, flooding, etcetera, will affect its recreation 
value. ##

OTHER NATURAL FEATURES which can be of high interest 
are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast, beaches, sand 
dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera with which the area is blessed. 
Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which 
are of national or state significance, counties should seek out these 
features which are distinctive of their area. Although the site may 
not contain the features themselves, there are often opportunities 
to include them as additional interest to the site. The route to the 
park may lead people past them or display views of them. A group of 
native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can 
be featured at the site.   The fish, animals, and birds which 
may be found at the site are another interest. Fishing interest calls 
for a check of the species found, quantity and size, the season they 
are available, and the stocking program of the fish commission. Animals 
may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas. The 
site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its 
own resident bird life. Clams, crabs, and other marine life may add 
interest at coastal areas. ##

EACH AREA has its own historical 
interests with which much can be done. Park visitors are always 
eager to learn more about the area they are in. The historical sign 
tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the 
original historical items or places themselves which still have the 
character of the period covered. Notice should be taken of unusual rock 
formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's crust in your region. 
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area 
can add geological interest to the recreation sites. An old shipwreck, 
a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other 
semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera may be of interest. 
Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian 
village sites or hunting areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera. 
How well can the site be developed? Look at the physical features 
of the land to determine how desirable it is for use, what can be done 
to correct the faults, and what it will cost to make the area meet your 
needs in comparison to other sites. Many things need to be checked: 

#SIZE AND SHAPE#- The size of the area alone can be a determining 
factor. An area may be too small for the needs of the project. 
Areas should be large enough to include the attractions, have ample 
space for the use of facilities needed, and have room around the edges 
to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments. 
Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation 
areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical 
to operate one large area than several small ones.   Shape 
of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the 
development. A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient 
in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width 
in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide. This 
is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your 
buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions. However, a 
narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide 
additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include 
scenic strips within the park unit. 

#ADJOINING AREAS#- The values 
of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands, 
ownership and use of the land, and the utilities available there. For 
instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national 
forest or a public road, may be desirable, whereas a site next 
to an industrial plant might not. The utilities available nearby may 
provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the 
site. 

#TOPOGRAPHY#- Topography is very important. Check the 
elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage, rock 
outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as subsoil. Nearly level 
areas are required for parking areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields, 
etcetera. Determine how much topography limits useful area or what 
the costs of earth moving or grading might be. 

#WATER#- In addition 
to its recreation interests, water is needed for drinking, sanitation, 
and irrigation. The quantity and quality of water sources is 
often a big factor in site selection. The area may provide good springs 
or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines. Figure 
the cost of providing water to the use areas. 

#PLANTS#- The 
existing plant growth calls for thorough checking. Look at the trees 
as to size and interest, the amount of shade they provide, how healthy 
they are, the problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw, 
etcetera.   An area may have been partially logged and requires 
removal of stumps or clean up. Some shrubs may be of good landscaping 
value, other areas of brush may need to be cleared. The extent and location 
of open areas is noted. 

#EXPOSURE#- How much will wind, 
rain, sun, and temperature affect the use? An area sheltered from 
strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use. The direction, 
velocity, and season of these winds should be noted as to just how 
they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation 
of the area. Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for 
the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable. 
Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography 
or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or 
whatever may be most desirable for the use intended. 

#IMPROVEMENTS#- 
Some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings, 
roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera which may raise the cost of 
the site.

Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 
70th Anniversary for the April issue of <Sovietskaya Muzyka> is 
accepted with pleasure, because I admire the music of Prokofieff; 
and with sober purpose, because the development of Prokofieff personifies, 
in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics.   The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the 
United States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of pranks 
and <bonheur>- and very capable as a professional musician. These 
qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic 
<haute monde> which supported the concert world of the post-World 
War /1, era. Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor 
in America was, indeed, brilliant.   Prokofieff's <Classical> 
Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted 
and well-trained musician still in his twenties. To the Traditionalists, 
it was a brilliant satire on modernism; to the Neo-Classicists, 
it was a challenge to the pre-war world. What was it to Prokofieff? 
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas; a trial 
balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times; a brilliant <piece 
de resistance?> Certainly its composer was an ascending star 
on a new world horizon.   I heard the <Classical> Symphony 
for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927. 
All musical Paris was there. Some musicians were enthusiastic, some 
skeptical. I myself was one of the skeptics (35 years ago). I remember 
Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting in his high-pitched voice: 
"**h it may be a <tour de force, mais mon Dieu,> can anyone take 
this music seriously"?   The answer is, "Yes"! Certainly, 
America took Prokofieff and his <Classical> Symphony seriously, 
and with a good deal of pleasure. His life-long friend, Serge 
Koussevitzky, gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances 
in Boston, New York, and Washington, D& C&, to which 
he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation. Chicago was 
also a welcome host: there, in 1921, Prokofieff conducted the world 
premiere of the <Love for Three Oranges,> and played the first 
performance of his Third Piano Concerto. "Uncle Sam" was, indeed, 
a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war victory 
years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations and extravaganzas, enjoyment 
and pleasure: "The Golden Twenties". We attended the 
premieres of his concertos, symphonies, and suites; we studied, taught, 
and performed his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches; 
we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities. 
We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as 
a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers.

Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during 
the Twenties: the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western 
World- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated- 
the <chic> Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich 
America- the <avant-garde> Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky, 
Cocteau, Picasso- the <laissez-faire> Paris of Dadaism 
and ultramodern art- the Paris <sympathique> which took young 
composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.

So young Prokofieff was the darling of success: in his motherland; 
in the spacious hunting grounds of "Uncle Sam"; in the exciting 
salons of his lovely, brilliant Paris- mistress of gaiety- 
excess and abandon- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color, 
dance, design, and thought.   Meanwhile, three great terrible 
forces were coagulating and crystallizing. In this world-wide conscription 
of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled to his 
native land. The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts 
of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the 
Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist 
tyranny into cringing submission. After this holocaust, a changing world 
occupied the minds of men; a world beset with new boundaries, new 
treaties and governments, new goals and methods, and the age-old fears 
of aggression 
and subjugation- hunger and exposure.   In this 
changed world, Prokofieff settled to find himself, and to create 
for 
large national purpose. Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune
