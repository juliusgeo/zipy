His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had 
imposed a dual mission upon himself: to free his slaves, and to keep 
the family from falling apart over the issue. When Giffen decided 
to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily 
assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers 
would never have any cause to complain of him.   in view of these 
difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana. Giffen had already 
urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters. 
His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him 
to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-April. Palfrey 
told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New 
Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence 
that he might be allowed to see his family again.   During his journey 
Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists. In both cases he 
desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived 
in the North. In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed him 
enthusiastically: "I have lately heard of you from the Legislature 
of Louisiana, and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood 
of man". Mrs& Child, who had once apologized for sending 
editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one 
of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before, 
but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana. She agreed to 
take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send 
them north immediately. At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey consulted 
with Cassius M& Clay on the same subject, but with no apparent 
result.   Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety, 
Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial. Instead 
of the expected "annoyances" due to the nature of his mission, 
he received many calling cards and invitations from "gentlemen of mark, 
on whom I had no sort of claim, + have had many more invitations 
than I could accept". He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of 
the "marked attention and civility" with which the New Orleans 
gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him. The memory of this southern 
hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years 
and Civil War. Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic 
account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas, 
"many of whom were coarse + passionate people, much excited by what 
they heard of my plans". He proceeded with his task bravely- in 
his memoirs, at least- before the "passions of my neighbors should 
have time to boil too high".   Palfrey had already made up his 
mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely 
whether or not to go North for freedom. The women by remaining behind 
condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage. He had a 
short private talk with each adult slave. Only one objected, but Palfrey 
soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others. All the 
slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure 
until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in "their 
own little produce". Palfrey agreed; the slaves were to remain 
as wage laborers for his account. William's threat that under 
no conditions would he allow "freedom-conscious" slaves to mix with 
his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation 
as before. Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to 
have made an arrangement "so satisfactory to my judgment + my conscience".

From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest 
in the welfare of his slaves. In fact, as the time for their departure 
approached, his solicitousness increased. Should any slave change 
his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage 
at once. When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally 
established, 
Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters 
in New Orleans and aboard ship. Giffen assured him that the captain 
and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration. 
Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage 
to pay for their labor throughout 1844. The plantation was sold in January, 
1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people 
two months' wages. Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation 
for a year's work; the new owner at Attakapas declined to 
enter into any philanthropic arrangement.   On March 21, 1845 the 
bark <Bashaw> weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee 
Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former 
chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled 
regret and jubilation.   Not all of Palfrey's slaves were 
aboard the <Bashaw>. Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult 
to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants. Two of 
these were included in Palfrey's lot. Giffen filed a petition for 
permission to emancipate four slaves (all more than fifty years old) 
with the St& Martin's Parish Police Jury. After an initial rejection, 
which he attributed to a "general Excitement against Abolition 
and Emancipation", Giffen bribed the right individuals on the 
jury, and got the permission without further delay.   When the 
Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were, of course, no longer 
slaves. Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of 
the constitution of 1780, which declared "all men are born free and 
equal". Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's 
Chapel to formalize the emancipation. An eyewitness recalled 
how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed 
in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed 
while they listened to the few words that declared them free.

Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction, 
he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes 
as servants. Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in 
the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts. 
Mrs& Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children 
with a Quaker 
family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York. 
This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was 
in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.

But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a 
group more varied in background and interest. Secretary of State Dean 
Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean, has headed 
the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for 
international cultural exchange. One of his initial acts in office 
was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first 
Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs. 
("In the late forties and fifties", Coombs has declared in defining 
his role, "two strong new arms were added to reinforce United 
States foreign policy **h economic assistance and military assistance. 
As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity **h to build 
a third strong arm, aimed at the development of people, at the fuller 
realization of their creative human potential, and at better understanding 
among them".)   Many of the new appointees are art collectors. 
Ambassador-at-Large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital 
with a collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin, 
Van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and 
Walt Kuhn. The Director of the Peace Corps, R& Sargent Shriver, 
Jr&, a Kennedy brother-in-law, collects heavily among the moderns, 
including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers. Secretary of the Treasury 
Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet, <Femmes dans un jardin>.

Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, former President 
of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation different from 
that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson, 
who had been head of General Motors. Unlike Wilson, who at 
times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism. McNamara 
is the scholar-businessman. An inveterate reader of books, he chose 
while working in Detroit to live in the University community of 
Ann Arbor, almost forty miles away. He selected as Comptroller of 
Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former Rhodes Scholar, Charles 
Hitch, who is author of a study on <The Economics of Defense 
in the Nuclear Age>.   One of the President's special assistants, 
the Harvard dean McGeorge Bundy, was co-author with Henry 
L& Stimson of the latter's classic memoir, <On Active Service>. 
Another, Arthur M& Schlesinger, Jr&, has won a Pulitzer 
Prize in history; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter. The 
Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy as a pianist. 
("It is always of sorrow to me when I find people who **h neither 
know nor understand music", he declared not long ago in proposing 
that White House prizes be awarded for music and art.) Mrs& Arthur 
Goldberg, wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally 
and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District 
of Columbia. ("Artists are always at a new frontier", she claims. 
"In fact, the search is almost more important than the find".) 
Mrs& Henry Labouisse, wife of the new director of the foreign 
aid program, is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.   The list 
goes on. At last count, sixteen former Rhodes Scholars (see box on 
page 13) had been appointed to the Administration, second in number 
only to its Harvard graduates. Besides Schlesinger, the Justice Department's 
Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has won a Pulitzer 
Prize (for national reporting). Postmaster General J& Edward 
Day, who must deal with matters of postal censorship, is himself 
author of a novel, <Bartholf Street,> albeit one he was obliged to 
publish 
at his own expense.   Two men show promise of playing prominent 
roles:   William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has 
been a long-time friend of the President. They arrived in Washington 
about the same time during the early postwar years: Kennedy as the 
young Congressman from Massachusetts; Walton, after a wartime stint 
with <Time-Life>, to become bureau chief for the <New Republic>. 
Both lived in Georgetown, were unattached, and shared an active 
social life. Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become 
one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters, vows that he 
and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days. Nonetheless, they 
found common interests. During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked 
Walton, an utter novice in organization politics, to assist him. 
Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the 
hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted 
to be liaison officer to critically important New York City.

Walton, who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's 
paratroopers during the invasion of France, combines the soul 
of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy. He provoked outraged editorials 
when, after a post-Inaugural inspection of the White House 
with Mrs& Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, "We just cased the 
joint to see what was there". But his credentials are impeccable. 
Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise 
on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the 
renovation of Lafayette Square. A man of great talent, he will continue 
to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter, strictly ex 
officio, for culture.   A more official representative is the Secretary 
of the Interior. Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon 
first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken man with a lust 
for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight. 
But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians, he displays 
a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments. 
His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals 
such as C& P& Snow, Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.

Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great 
deal more than dams and wildlife preserves. After promoting Frost's 
appearance at the Inauguration, he persuaded the poet to return 
several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet 
members, members of Congress, and other Washington notables gathered 
in the State Department auditorium. The event was so successful 
that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar 
ones from time to time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment 
of the Administration.   His Ideas in this respect, however, 
sometimes arouse critical response. One tempest was stirred up last
