At fifteen he didn't care that he had no mother, that he couldn't 
remember her face or her touch; neither did he care that Aunt Rose 
provided for him.   He was named Pompeii as a tribute to his 
heritage, and he couldn't have cared less about that either. To him 
life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended 
only with sleep.   When he would be a man, he would be a rich 
man. He would not be like the "rich Americans" who lived in white-columned 
houses on the other side of the park. He would not ride the 
eight-thirty local to the city each morning. He would not carry a brief 
case. Nor would he work at all. He would square his shoulders and 
carry a cane before each step. He would sit inside the coffee shop 
and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and 
come running, bowing with her running, calling out in her bowing, "At 
your service". He would order her to bring coffee, and would take 
from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff- he would 
not remove his gloves- and light and smoke. He could do that when 
he would be a man.   "Hey, Laura"! he called to his sister 
on the porch above the steps. She was only ten months older than 
he. "Laura, what would you say if I smoked a pipe"?   Laura 
did not answer him. She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch 
fence, brushing and drying her wet, gilded hair in the sun. One lithe 
leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking, 
torn pales. Her tanned foot, whose arch swept high and white, pointed 
artfully toward tapering toes- toes like fingers, whose tips glowed 
white. All the while she sat there, her sinewy arms swirled before her 
chest.   Her face showed no sign of having heard Pompeii. It 
was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to 
fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines 
of its contours. The eyes, blue and always somewhat downcast, possessed 
a sullen quality. Even though the boy could not see them, he knew 
they were clouded by distance. He was never sure they fully took 
him in.   Pompeii called again, "Laura"! But the only answer 
that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg 
moving against it.   "She's in a mood", he thought "There's 
not a month she doesn't get herself in a mood".   Well, 
what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams 
to dream about? And as for his pipe, if he wanted to smoke one, 
nobody would stop him. Not even Laura.   Suddenly he was interrupted 
in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin, 
and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue, 
feasting against the salt taste of him. Above the tongue, an aged 
yellow eye, sallow and time-cast, encrusted within a sphere of marbleized 
pink skin, stared unfalteringly at him.   "Christ sake, 
goat, git"! But the goat would not.   "You're boiling 
milk, ain't you"? soothing it with his hand, knowing the whiskered 
jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly 
to his touch. Pompeii rolled over. His head undulated gradually, covering 
space, to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth 
of those teats. With his mouth opened wide, he squirted the warm 
white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light, 
earthy taste of it. The boy's fingers and mouth operated with 
the skilled unity of a bagpipe player, pressing and pulling, delighting 
in what he did.   Above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm 
cloud. Its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane. But the 
boy could see only the goat's belly.   The Old Man near the 
corner let the shadow pass over him, sensing something portentous in 
it. He knew it was there, knew also what it was about, but he wouldn't 
raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back. There would 
be time enough, perhaps the Old Man reassured himself, to pay the 
devil his due. Time enough to give up his soul.   In the meantime, 
six sandals, stained an ocher, the same color as Pompeii's shaved 
hair, edged up close to him. The clapping they made on the concrete 
interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew, so that he quickly 
released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches 
for ticks.   He knew at a glance that the biggest sandals 
belonged to Niobe, the neatest ones to Concetta, and the laced ones 
to Romeo, Concetta's idiot brother. Pompeii expected Romeo's 
small body to sink closer and closer to the ground. He expected Concetta's 
thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy, and her shrill, impetuous 
voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that 
was never sure of hearing anything.

People came in and out all evening to see the baby and hold it. 
The room filled with smoke, and Maggie's head throbbed with excitement 
and fatigue, but Stuart had such a happy, earnest look of proud 
possession on his face that Maggie couldn't bear to do anything to 
quench it.   Little Anne rapidly outdistanced her mother in recovery. 
In two months she became a fat highly social baby, with a fuzz 
of flaxen hair all over her head. She stopped flying into rages and 
started digesting her food; she developed a peaches and cream complexion 
and a sunny disposition, and she asked for nothing more of life 
than that she be kept dry and comfortable and fed huge amounts of food 
at stated intervals and be carried to where she could watch activity 
going on around her.   She was so heavy that Maggie's arms shook 
from lifting her and taking care of her. Maggie couldn't seem 
to 
get her strength back or catch up with herself with all she had to do: 
there was the big basket of clothes to be coaxed through the rackety 
old washer and lugged out and lugged back; there was the daily round 
of household chores in which Maggie insisted on participating. Worry 
had a great deal to do with it; Stuart had been laid off at the 
produce company and had to go back to sitting in his father's office, 
taking what salary his father could hand out to him. Mr& Clifton 
would have preferred death and bankruptcy to having his son stay with 
his wife's people without contributing to his and his family's 
upkeep, and besides that there were the things that had to be bought 
for the baby, 
milk and orange juice and vitamins and soap, just plain soap. 
Maggie and Stuart pored over figures every night, trying to find how 
they could squeeze out a few pennies more.   In desperation Maggie 
consulted Eugenia one afternoon: "Do you think you could 
find me something I could do here at home to make some money, so I could 
still watch the baby and do the rest of the things"?   "It 
seems to me you have enough to do as it is", Eugenia said. She 
had been watching Maggie go from the washing machine to the baby to 
the stove and back again.   "I have plenty of odd moments when 
I could be doing something", Maggie said. "It would make me 
feel a lot better, but the Woman's Exchange isn't taking baked goods 
any more and I can't leave the baby with Grandma because she 
isn't strong enough and the baby's too young to be put in a nursery".

"I should think so", Eugenia said. "For one thing 
you can stop keeping that child in starched dresses and changed from the 
skin out nineteen times a day".   "She's so beautiful, 
and I do like to keep her looking nice". Maggie said. She picked 
up the baby and nuzzled her fat warm little neck.   "She'll 
be just as beautiful in something that doesn't have to be ironed", 
Eugenia said. "Evadna Mae Evans said she didn't put a thing on 
her child but a flannel wrapper until it was nine months old".

"Evadna Mae Evans got all her baby clothes from Best's Liliputian 
Bazaar in New York, and I'm sick and tired of hearing about 
Evadna Mae Evans".   "Well now, Maggie, you don't 
have to snap at me", Eugenia said. "I'm just thinking of a way 
for you to be sensible".   "I'm sorry. I do seem to snap 
at everybody these days, but I would like to think of a way to make 
a little extra money".   "Well, let's see. Let's make 
a list of your assets".   Maggie started laughing, and she laughed 
so hard she couldn't stop, and she kept on laughing while she lugged 
the clothes out to the yard to hang them up while the sun was still 
shining. When she came back Eugenia was sitting at the kitchen table 
with a pencil and envelope jotting down words and figures. 
"I have here that you could run a nursery of your own for working 
mothers", 
Eugenia said. "We could put up cribs on the second floor 
sleeping porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it's 
nice and sunny, but of course it would entail quite a bit of running 
up and down stairs and Chris said you were to be careful about that".

"What else"?   "You might set up a dress 
shop in the 
living room".   "Every woman in the block has tried that".

"What about a tea room, then? You could set up tables 
in the front room and serve salads and your baked beans and brown bread 
and Grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortunes". 
"It's too elaborate. And Grandma isn't strong enough to take 
on something like that, and to tell you the truth neither am I".

Eugenia sighed. She said, "Well, those are the really interesting 
things, but if you don't like any of those I can turn over some 
of my extra typing jobs to you, if you think you can type well enough".

"Oh, I'm sure I could do that", Maggie said. "But 
it really wouldn't be fair, taking your jobs away from you".

"Don't worry, I can get plenty more", Eugenia said, wondering 
where in the world she could. Maggie was looking much happier 
already, clearing a space on the table and chattering about how she could 
put up a typewriter right there, and be brushing up on her typing 
so Eugenia wouldn't be ashamed of it. "And then whenever I have 
a minute I can be working at it, and keep an eye on the baby and the 
stove at the same time. And I can go back to my contests and be thinking 
while I'm doing the washing".   "What are you going 
to do with your feet so you don't waste anything"?   Maggie 
laughed. She said, "Oh Eugenia, I wish **h"   "What"?

"I wish I had three wishes", Maggie said. "All 
of them for you". ##

It grew bitterly cold toward the end of November, 
contributing to the miseries of countless numbers of people. 
The temperature dropped to twenty below at night and stood at zero during 
the days. The cold settled like a tangible pall over the Mile 
High City, locking it in an icy grip that harshened its outlines and 
altered its physical appearance; it had a look of grim stark realism, 
resembling other cities whose habitual climate was cold, instead of 
the sprawling bumptious open-handed greedy Western city basking in eternal 
sunshine at the foot of mountains stored with endless riches and 
resources.   The jobless huddled in the streets outside of employment 
offices, outside newspaper buildings, in parks, in relief lines, 
outside government agencies. There weren't facilities to take care 
of them; there never had been a need felt for such facilities. That 
kind of poverty was regarded as the exclusive property of the East, 
which created depressions with their stock markets and their congested 
populations and their greedy centralization of industries, protected 
by discriminatory freight rates. The East was popularly supposed 
to have got the country into war and into depression, dragging the west 
along; and now the East was creating government agencies for which 
the West doubtless would have to pay.   The government offices 
were being opened but they weren't being opened fast enough and meanwhile 
the cold penetrated everything. Shivering, people talked and 
argued; all this government spending would have to be paid for somehow, 
but on the other hand desperate circumstances called for desperate 
remedies and something had to be done.   Something had to be done; 
it was the theme song of millions of American people, their personal 
problems no less urgent than those of the government. Something 
had to be done. The Abernathys said it to each other a dozen times 
a day.   Something had to be done about the furnace, the fuel bills, 
the washing machine, the doctor and dentist bills, about making
