slicker, bearing down on him. "Three-day blow"! she bellowed 
triumphantly. He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard 
really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists. 
"Fine, day after tomorrow", she added.   "I hope so", 
he said. "I've got this cold. Thought I'd bake it out in 
the sun".   "Ah". She studied him briefly. "You've got 
a peaked look. Better get in out of the wet".   Charlie forbore 
to mention that the wet was somewhat universal, Peony being less 
than weatherproof. As for its being fine, day after tomorrow, he had 
the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again, with Vivian 
lost to him forever. He could imagine her at this minute, honeymooning 
in Nassau with what's-his-name, lounging on golden sands, looking 
forward to a life of unalloyed bliss. All Charlie could look forward 
to was a yellow pill at noon, a salami sandwich for lunch, and a 
lonely old age- if he lived that long.   He leafed through the 
light reading provided by Mrs& Kirby for her guests: four separate 
adventures of the Bobbsey Twins (<At the Seashore, At the Mountains, 
On the Farm>, and <In Danger>) and several agricultural 
bulletins 
on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle, hideously 
illustrated. He dozed, only to dream of Vivian, and woke, only to 
crash into the night table, bruising his other shin. He took a yellow 
pill, only to choke on it, and went for the salami, only to find something 
alive in the refrigerator- something pink and fuzzy. 
His first thought was that Mrs& Kirby, in her mania for color, had 
dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator 
door and climb in; but on further investigation, the thing proved to 
be a sweater, of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets- 
pale, pale pink and, according to the label, size thirty-four. He 
thought about it for a minute, could find no reasonable explanation 
for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator, got the salami, bread, 
and a Bermuda onion, and put the whole thing out of his mind. ## 

Next morning, he found a note in the refrigerator. "Would you 
mind wrapping your onion"? said this note. "The smell permeates 
everything"! Everything being the sweater, a lipstick case, and 
a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion. The note paper 
was pink, too, and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine. 
Not that he had supposed, considering the evidence, that he was 
sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol. He scrawled 
"Sorry" across the bottom of the note and then, against his 
better judgment, added: "Don't you eat"? He didn't want 
to encourage anything here; but on the other hand, he didn't want 
her swiping his salami.   "Not onions", came the answer the 
following day. "Ugh".   Must have really smelled up her 
sweater, he thought, and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen. 
But then, as he well knew, women are not guided by logic 
or common sense. Take Vivian. Yes, take Vivian. Somebody had.

Now, if this were Vivian next door to him and if, for some obscure 
female reason, she kept her clothes in the refrigerator, they would 
not be pink. They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid, chic 
and splashy, like Vivian herself. Pink, Vivian once had told 
him, 
was for baby girls, and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously 
clinging to their infancy.   "Why does this girl keep a sweater 
in the refrigerator"? he mused aloud. ##

Eh"? It was 
Mrs& Kirby, making her toilsome way along the veranda, laden with 
a clattery collection of mops, brushes, and pails. "What's that 
you say"?   "Oh, nothing. Just glad the rain's stopped".

"Oh, yes. Just look at that sky. Be a scorcher by afternoon".

"I hope so. I've got this cold".   "So 
you said". She scrutinized him. "My, you're peaked. You want 
to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash, first sunny day. 
I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur. That pale 
kind's the worst".   That pale kind, Charlie thought. Hardly 
an inviting description. But then, neither was peaked. He could 
hear Mrs& Kirby now, warning her pale guest against sunburn. "I 
spoke to the fellow next door, too", she might say. "He's that 
peaked kind".   Surely there was a better word. Charlie looked 
in the mirror. Run-down, iron-poor. He looked more closely. Frail, 
feeble- peaked. 
Clearly, two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins 
had done him no good.   The sun, blazing hot as prophesied, was 
far from kind to Mrs& Kirby's varicolored properties. When Charlie 
came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill, the whole establishment 
(gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog) looked like a 
floodlit modern painting- great blocks of dizzy color, punctuated at 
regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators. 
This weekend, he thought, he would look around for some more subdued 
retreat, with Cape roses, maybe, at the door. He could not imagine 
a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony, Larkspur, and 
the rest.   The sweater was gone from the refrigerator, and in 
its place was a large plastic bag, full of wet pink clothes. No wonder 
she was so pale, wearing all those cold clothes.   He got a 
red pill and a beer and then, on impulse, transferred the rest of his 
salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled "Be my guest" 
on the wrapping. It gave him a good feeling.   "M-m-m. Thanks", 
was her answer the next day. The note was propped against his 
pill bottles and bore a postscript: "You're not at all well, are 
you"?   "I've got this cold", he wrote. Not that it 
was any of her business.   "It's none of my business", said 
the next note, "but my aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey 
in hot water for a cold, and she lived to be ninety-six. I mean, 
she's still living, and she's ninety-six. Why don't you try that"?

"I don't have a lemon". He had to write very small 
to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper.   By the next 
morning, she had turned the paper over. "Gee, neither do I".

Charlie grinned. She didn't <sound> like a pale girl. She 
sounded a little like a redhead. But then, redheads are often pale.

He stuck his head in Mrs& Kirby's little rental office. 
"I guess that redhead next to me took your advice. I haven't seen 
her on the beach".   "You won't, if you're looking for 
a redhead. She's got browny hair".   He spent that afternoon 
on the beach, looking for a pale, browny-haired girl in a pink bathing 
suit. There were pink bathing suits on blondes, and browny-haired 
girls in red or black or green bathing suits. There were a sprinkling 
of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits. Up on 
a dune, he saw a girl, all by herself, sitting on a camp stool before 
an easel and absorbed in her painting. He paid little attention to her 
because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white- one 
of those bulky, turtle-neck sweaters. On the beach, there were pale girls 
and not-so-pale girls. And he saw them all as he walked up and down.

At two that morning, he was still walking- up and down 
Peony, up and down the veranda, up and down the silent, moonlit beach. 
Finally, in desperation, he opened the refrigerator, filched her hand 
lotion, and left a note. "I've got this sunburn", said the note, 
"and I used some of your hand lotion. Hope you don't mind".

"Of course I don't mind", she answered. "You're 
having a miserable time, aren't you? Use all the lotion you want, 
and for goodness' sake, stay in out of the sun for a couple of days".

This was a very warm, sympathetic girl, he decided. Sympathy 
is a fine quality in a woman. Now Vivian, for instance, was not 
too long on sympathy. She felt, and said, that sympathy only made people 
feel sorry for themselves; it was a tough world, and you had to 
be tough to hold your own. He didn't know what was so tough about 
Vivian's world, slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name. Suppose 
what's-his-name got a sunburn? Charlie couldn't see Vivian 
offering any hand lotion. She might peel him, once the worst of the 
agony was over. ##

Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama 
bottoms, waiting for the fire in his back to subside, and used generous 
quantities of the hand lotion.   Correspondence passed back 
and forth.   "How's your sunburn now? The only thing, this 
lotion has glycerin in it, and that whitens the skin, so if you're 
so anxious to get a tan, you may not want to use it".   "I'm 
not that anxious, but maybe that's why you're so fair".

"That Mrs& Kirby! I'll bet she told you I was puny, too. 
How's your cold"?   "Broiled out. She didn't say 
you were puny. Are you? What's puny"?   "Puny goes 
with pale and peaked. Do you have anything to read while you're shut 
up? There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness, 
and a book called 'Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe'; but the 
picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister. Also the canoe". 
There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot. The 
new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that 
took a hop. For a few innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him 
out. Then, in the fifth, Anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve 
and smacked the ball into left center field. @ Eddie Lee, Riverside's 
redheaded playing manager, ran after the ball but it rolled 
past him. Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the 
relay. Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to 
Phil. @ "Third! Third base"! Eddie shouted. @ Phil 
spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan's hands on 
third base. Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag. 
But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late. He came into 
the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in 
his face. @ 
"You bastard"! the Anniston catcher screamed. He 
jumped to his feet and started to throw punches. Mike Deegan tossed 
his glove away and began to swing at the catcher. This brought in everybody 
from both sides, while the spectators stood up and added to the 
uproar. @ The fighters were separated in a few minutes. The game 
was resumed. But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now. When the inning 
was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout. 
@ Phil Rossoff, coming in from left field, stopped at the water 
fountain for a drink. Mike Deegan was standing beside it, facing the 
field. He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before 
the inning began. @ "Keep your eyes open, sonny"! Mike 
yelled to the catcher. "You're in for trouble". @ The Anniston 
catcher did not reply with words. He simply turned to Mike and smiled. 
This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said: "I'll 
get that little bastard. So help me God, I'll get him".

Phil Rossoff said: "Why don't you leave him alone"?

"Mind your own goddamn business", Mike Deegan said.

Phil shrugged. He stepped into the dugout, wondering why Deegan 
was always looking for trouble. Maybe the answer was in his eyes. When 
Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips.   In the 
last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast 
ball over the left fielder's head. By the time the fielder got his 
hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home. 
The left fielder threw and it was a good one. But Mike had no chance 
of being tagged. The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate. 
All Deegan had to do was slide, fall away, but instead, he rammed into 
the catcher.   Both fell heavily to the ground.   Only
