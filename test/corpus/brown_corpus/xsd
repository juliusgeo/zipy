disdaining the gloom they saw in the faces around them.   They 
came out and held their games and races. It was they who held the 
future in their hands. They went into the sun together and paraded grandly 
in their war clothes, painting their faces with the sacred <attis> 
dug far off in the cave of skeletons. They danced the <paxam> 
wildly at night, the war dance, and dipped their arrowheads in the venom 
of rattlesnakes and rode their horses in swift maneuvers, firing their 
few guns in unison at some indeterminate signal.   Walitzee 
was among them, and Sarpsis, and they wore red blankets which flew like 
broad wings in the air of their passing. And a very young one, Swan 
Necklace, tried to emulate them and followed timidly. Yellow Wolf 
was there, nephew of the young chief by an older brother long dead, 
in whom also the disordered chemistries of youth worked. He would spring 
bolt upright suddenly after sitting quietly with inaction, because 
something had boiled over in his fermenting juices.   All the 
young men, Alokut among them, challenged them in matched racing. They 
raced and maneuvered for war, swinging their horses in single file 
and then abreast like cavalry. At times they would ride frenziedly through 
the camp, letting the women see their courage, how handsome they 
were in their regalia. Then again they would stand in circles making 
other preparations. They combed their hair and streaked it at the part 
and greased the bangs so that the hair above their foreheads stood 
rigid like the tails of sage hens making love.   Walitzee whitened 
his leggings with clay, knowing the girl watched from her place in 
the trees. He saw himself in a superior reflection, and he was as a 
speeding arrow from the taut bow, hurtling with a mad grace, his maleness 
shining and scented with meadow rue. He was always aware of the women's 
eyes which followed him, admiring him. And the suspicious, envenomed 
eyes of Pile of Clouds. And those of Early Spring, haunted 
and now 
full of hurt and envy. He felt so much like laughing; even 
like shouting and crying out from the hilltops from which he could descend 
as an eagle in a mad caper from the cliffs.   He and Sarpsis 
planned a great parade with the young men. They would give one final 
testimony of their challenge to let the people see their arrogance. 
They would ride with streaming amulets, their colors ripening in the 
sun, shouting the last bellicosity of a nation in the throes of death.

And so the sun came up again and for a moment its color was 
the young men's blood, shifting then into the full heat and outcry 
which ran with their hearts. They mounted their horses and rode off 
into the hills. #/3,#

The young chief stared at the wall of his 
lodge, listening. The sound rose on the other side of the hills, vanished 
and rose again and he could imagine the mad, disheveled hoofs of 
the Appaloosas, horses the white men once had called the Dogs of Hell. 
He saw them in fleet images as they came rolling and now burst across 
the ridge. Standing then with the others, peering into the sun, 
he saw the bright, multicolored legion, their hair flying like dark banners, 
only the thunder, the roll of drums, the mad cacophony of the 
hoofs accompanying them. They leaned into the wind and seemed like one 
thousand-legged monster hurtling and plunging until suddenly they rose 
straight in their saddles and in one terrifying voice shouted, ejaculated 
their grotesque cry of war.

She was moving through a screen of hemlocks, in among the white 
birch and maples. The sounds from the quarry began to pulse in her 
ears. She stood, 
once more listening. She had never been here at this 
hour. She felt as if some dark, totally unfamiliar shape would clutch 
at her arm; but she found the path she always used, the stubs of branches 
she had broken, those she had pushed aside; and she walked easily 
now, and more slowly, until she could see the dark glisten of water 
beneath her.   If I ever committed suicide, she thought, I 
would dive straight down from here- and no one would find me for days. 
She smiled, and expertly let herself downward, holding this known 
root or that, her sneakers sliding in the leaves.   She jumped 
out onto the flat expanse of rock and, seating herself, shook her short-cut 
brown hair and tilted her chin far upward. The reedy music of the 
frogs had faded, but presently it began again, growing in volume until 
it was vibrant. Julia felt at peace and drew her legs up and clasped 
her hands tightly around the bent knees. She had accomplished a miracle. 
This was <her> place. The hour couldn't change it **h. Only- 
only- her thoughts were a little strange. They were becoming 
confused. Perhaps it was because it was so late, and because she had 
no business to be here now.   She was thinking of Paul a few 
weeks ago, in the Easter holidays, with her at one of those awful Friday 
Evening Dancing Class parties her mother had made her attend. 
"Hello, Julie, how are you"? **h And then off he went so casually, 
to someone else with breasts better developed, more obvious in a 
lower-cut dress, someone without a mouthful of wire bands and an inability 
to find words that would hold him. I wish he was with me now, she 
thought, and that we were both the ages we are and doing what was once 
only pretense and acute embarrassment. Oh God! I wish I were 
older or younger, Julia Bentley thought. I wish so much someone <loved> 
me. 

#CHAPTER 7#

George Rawlings remembered seeing the door 
open sometime during the night- Millie, in a white robe, standing 
like a ghost at the threshold. She had vanished; he must have slept 
again. He was staring at the blue china lamp left on beside him. 
It seemed too much trouble even to reach for the switch; but of course 
the impossible effort of leaving would have to be made on this Monday 
morning. This room was like a prison. He would not be indebted 
to Sam! Below him, as if at the end of some remote tunnel, he heard 
the humming of a vacuum cleaner. His fingers fumbled across the bandages. 
They had left both of his eyes uncovered **h. Well, he told himself, 
let's put the show on the road.   He was walking across 
to the bathroom. He drank a glass of water and gripped the sink with 
both hands. A fearful pain had come from his head, as if the water 
were coursing up through the blood vessels and expanding them **h. He 
recognized 
his jacket and trousers. The fabric was dark; the stains weren't 
too apparent; and there were his shoes, thank God, but his shirt 
was one terrible mess.   He shivered, and then tore away the 
blood-soaked parts and wound the rest around his neck like a scarf. 
Sam would be amazed to find him gone. Millie would have to understand. 
She must have put his clothes in the closet. He found a lump rising 
in his throat because of that one simple act of tidiness. He was on 
the verge of tears. Alex Poldowski- in a fashion he owed a debt 
to that effete gentleman. At least Alex had told him he wasn't dying. 
Perhaps George Rawlings would be better off dead.   What 
time was it? He peered at his wristwatch. Strange, it was still running. 
A quarter to seven. Too early for a vacuum cleaner, but probably 
Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs. He 
was kneeling to tie his shoelaces. His fingers felt absurdly thick 
and clumsy. He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of 
the closet door. He barely knew himself. This was some freak, two 
strands of adhesive tape across his nose, like ugly roots from the mass 
of gauze, suddenly moist over his cheekbones. The surface, however, 
was perfectly white.   He was drinking another glass of water. 
It was after seven o'clock. He was supposed to be in court this afternoon, 
at City Hall. Who would take over? He'd have to think, 
but the main thing, the imperative necessity, was to leave before Sam 
Bentley was up and about, and before Millie detained him with sympathy.

He entered the hallway. He was actually walking down the 
stairs. A plane up in the sky, above the clouds, and this freakish 
wreck of a man desperately trying to get away.   "Father, is 
that you"? The voice issued from the cavern of the hall below. George 
did not reply. "Is that you, Father? **h Who's there"?

For a moment he felt like a thief discovered. Then Julia 
appeared under the arch leading to the dining room. She stood gazing 
at him.   "Uncle George"!   He was trying to smile 
at her.   "Gosh! You shouldn't be up, should you"?

"I- I was just leaving here, Julie **h. I'm all set. Just 
about to call a taxi".   She was wearing some sort of gray 
blazer. She seemed overly tall, her brow knitted in concern. "Well, 
at least you won't have to do that", she was saying. "I'm 
about to leave myself. I'll drop you off".   "<You're> 
leaving"?   "I'm going back to school", she answered. 
"Pietro's driving me. I'm just finishing breakfast **h. But 
have you told Mother you were going"? she asked him.   "No 
**h. I just don't want anyone disturbed, Julie. That's my wish. 
It's quite a big one", he added.   Her face seemed to 
float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight. "Well, won't you 
come in then, have a cup of coffee- or something? **h Or maybe 
a drink"? she asked, in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated, considerate, 
and yet perhaps partly scornful. He tried to see her face 
more clearly.   "No- nothing at all", he said after a moment's 
hesitation. "I'll just wait for you here".   He leaned 
his head against the wood paneling behind him, but the vivid red 
images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids. He raised them. 
Julia moved past.   "I have to say good-by upstairs. I won't 
be long".   "As a great favor, Julie", he said, "please 
don't mention you've seen me".   "Not to anyone"?

"No- please **h. "I'll call your mother as soon as 
I get home. It'll be so much easier".   "All right **h" 
She was staring at him.   "I'm fine, Julie **h. Please, 
you just go ahead".   She had disappeared. He could feel a 
pulse pounding against the bandages. He imagined Sam's voice: "George, 
what the hell goes on"? I wouldn't have the strength 
to answer, he thought. Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi.

He could hear the footsteps overhead. He saw the suitcase, which 
Julia was holding. He stood up.   "I'll take that, Julie- 
for you".   "Oh no", she said. "I can manage".

She went ahead of him. Outside the Lincoln was parked. He could 
hardly believe he was getting in. Pietro was gazing at him in an insolent, 
disdainful fashion; but that didn't matter.   We'll 
drop Mr& Rawlings off in Ardmore", Julia said, and for the merest 
second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants. 
To the manner born- odd to have such a thought at a time like this; 
yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed. He could not stop 
to analyze. He had never felt particularly close to her. Carrie seemed 
more affectionate, but obviously Julia had respected his request. 
He took her hand.   "I wish I didn't have to go back to school", 
she said, and then, "I wish you lived in New York. That's 
in the opposite direction".   "I wish I did", he responded. 
"I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume, and that 
we could go to a theater together, or a nice restaurant, forget we 
knew **h" He stopped speaking.   "Forget we ever knew what"?

"Oh, just sort of everything in general".   She 
said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace. "I know you 
feel badly, but that sounds like such a queer thing for <you> to say".

"Does it"? he asked. "Yes, perhaps. I'm supposed 
to joke about things, aren't I? **h But sometimes life 
can 
be rather a disappointing business".   His voice seemed thick 
and purposeless. He relinquished her hand. He could see the stone building 
where he lived. Just a few more steps **h. Abruptly he reached
