delayed his work somewhat. But up to date he has shown as much as any 
in the big Simpson stable.   Hustler (Knight Dream-Torkin) 
is a playful bay rascal of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely 
can pace and is right there with them, and sometimes leading them, in 
the best miles. Torrid Freight (Torrid-Breeze On Hal) is a very 
rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease 
everything asked of him. His best time is around 2:33.   Strongheart 
(Adios-Direct Gal), a fair-looking sorrel colt, knows nothing 
but pace and has been right there in the best miles. Torrid Adios 
(Torrid-Adios Molly) is not so masculine as most of the colts, 
but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers 
on the grounds. Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks, he is 
coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me. First Flyer (Frisco 
Flyer-Castle Light) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois 
Stakes. His best time is 2:33.2~h.   The colts in Simpson's 
stable have little if anything on the fillies, especially the 
pacers. Justine Hanover (Sampson Hanover-Justitia Hanover) is 
improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4~h weeks ago. 
Mrs& Freight (Knight Dream-Miss Reed) shows promise and does it 
in good form, and her best time is about 2:35. Hoopla (Tar Heel-Holiday 
Hanover), a filly that wanted to trot, knocked herself October 
31 and November 1 fighting the hopples. She was then trained on 
the trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart once around the 
half-mile track and hoppled again. This time she submitted and in 
a few days was going good. On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1-:38~h; 
on Jan& 18 2:37.3-:36.1~h; on Jan& 21, 2:36. 
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters, 
Valentine Day and Cerise- more scale and much better underpinning. 
She is more like her full brother, Taraday Hanover, but 
larger. Up to date she is a grand-looking filly.   Pete Dailey 
has four promising 2-year-old pacers. Marquis Pick (Gene Abbe-Direct 
Grattan) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time. 
He is a fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs and nice 
way of going. His best mile to date is 2:28-:33. Majestic Pick 
comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2. This colt is another 
fine-looking equine. Staley Hanover (Knight Dream-Sweetmite Hanover) 
is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks 
like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his 
class. Best time to date is 2:34-:34. Step Aside (Direct Rhythm-Wily 
Widow) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows 
promise.   Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked 
from 2:40 to 2:35. Bonnie Wick (Gene Abbe-Scotch Mary) has 
gone in 2:36~h; Hickory Ash (Titan Hanover-Misty Hanover) 
in 2:35. The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me 
and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself, "that 
must be Hickory Ash". She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot. 
Hickory Hill (Star's Pride-Venus Hanover) has gone in 2:33~h; 
Hickory Spark (Harlan-Hickory Tiny) 2:37~h; Buxton 
Hanover (Tar Heel-Beryl Hanover) 2:35; Faber's Kathy 
(Faber Hanover-Ceyway) 2:37~h; Honor Rodney (Rodney-Honor 
Bright) around 2:40. The last-named is a fine-looking, large colt, 
who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries. 
He is going sound again now, and looks good.   Brief Candle 
(Harlan-Marcia) has gone in 2:37~h; Lena Faber (Faber Hanover-Chalidale 
Lena) 2:33~h; Martha Rodney (Rodney-Miss Martha 
D&) 2:35~h; Checkit (Faber Hanover-Supermarket) 2:35~h; 
Charm Rodney (Rodney-The Charmer) 2:37~h; Fair 
Sail (Farvel-Topsy Herring) 2:36~h; Custom Maid (Knight Dream-Way 
Dream) 2:34.2~h; Jacky Dares (Meadow Gene-Princess 
Lorraine) 2:36~h; Good Flying (Good Time-Olivette Hanover) 
2:36~h; Bordner Hanover (Tar Heel-Betty Mahone) 2:34; 
Faber's Choice (Faber Hanover-Sally Joe Whippet) 2:36~h; 
Invercalt (Florican-Inverness) 2:35~h; Duffy Dares 
(Meadow Gene-Princess Mite) 2:36~h; Harold J& (Worthy Boy-Lady 
Scotland) 2:36; Knightfall (Knight Dream-Miss Worthy 
Grapes) 2:36~h; Next Knight (Knight Dream-Next Time) 2:36~h; 
Trader Jet (Florican-My Precious) 2:37~h; Trader 
Rich (Worthy Boy-Marquita Hanover) 2:37~h; Good Little 
Girl (Good Time-Mynah Hanover) 2:36~h; Iosola Hanover (Kimberly 
Kid-Isoletta Hanover) 2:36~h. The last-named is one 
of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her very much. I will 
be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future.

I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile 
in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3. In going away Debonnie got behind 
several lengths, stalling at the start- she is a little fussy. They 
left the three-quarters together and finished almost together. Prompt 
Time shows class. This filly is another Adios that wants to trot, 
and trot she did until forced to do otherwise. After well broken 
and equipped with 12~oz shoes on behind, bare-footed in front, she 
would trot a real storm with the master, Delvin, driving. Being placed 
in the hopples she was completely baffled. She hesitated, she hopped, 
she roll and rocked, skipped and jumped, but in some two weeks she 
started to pace, From that time to this she has shown steady improvement 
and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.

Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there were a few miles 
of note on Thursday. 
Those responsible included Stardel Hanover 
(Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 2:30-:34.3; Lorena Gallon 
(Bill Gallon-Loren Hanover), 2:30-:34.3; Prudent Hanover 
(Dean Hanover-Precious Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Premium 
Freight (Titan Hanover-Pebble Hanover), 2:30.3-:35.3; Laguerre 
Hanover (Tar Heel-Lotus Hanover), 2:30.3-:36.1; Monel 
(Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd), 2:30.3-:36.1; Fury Hanover (Hoot 
Mon-Fay), 2:30.3-:36; Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess Hanover), 
2:30.3-:36; Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover), 2:30.3-:36; 
Lucky Freight (Knight Dream-Lusty Helen), 2:31.3-:35.3.

Sam Caton's Butterwyn (Scotch Victor-Butler Wyn), 
a light bay filly, knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile 
in 2:30-:36. Riverboat (Dalzell-Cousin Rachel) has gone in 
2:38~h. Sam is having his troubles with Layton Hanover (Dean 
Hanover-Lucy Hanover), but hope to have him straightened out and going 
before long.   Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet (Adios-Rena 
Grattan) and she sure looks good as she goes by. Her best 
time to date is about 2:30~h. He also likes Hampton Hanover (Titan 
Hanover-Bertie Hanover) 2:37~h. Cathy J& Hanover (Tar 
Heel-Kaola Hanover), formerly called Karet Hanover, has been rather 
a problem child, but it getting better all the while and can pace 
a twice around in about 2:31. Armbro Comet (Nibble Hanover-Mauri 
Hanover) has been in 2:38.   Flick Nipe's and Neil Engle's 
Miss Phone (Galophone-Prissy Miss) is a fine-looking filly 
with good disposition and good gait, and she has worked up to date in 
2:46. 

#DEL MAR, CALIF&, FEB& 3#- After 52 rainless 
days, moisture finally came to Del Mar, resulting in but one workout 
during the week for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than 
half our total average rainfall during the season.   While 2-year-olds 
are still gaining most of the attention at the track, green 
horses are starting to go a bit, and Jimmy Cruise has several that 
can really make it. Work-outs for the week are as follows: Plain 
Scotch, 3 (by Scotch Victor), Demon Law, 3 (by Demon Hanover), 
Coffee Royal, ~p (by Royal Blackstone) and Beauty Way, ~p, 3 
(by Demon Hanover) in 2:25; Eddie Duke, ~p, 3 (by Duke of 
Lullwater), Marilyn C&, ~p (by Sampson Hanover) and Chalidale 
Barry, 5 (by King's Ransom) in 2:20; Tiger Hanover, ~p, 
3 (by Adios) in 2:26; Sherwood Lass, 4 (by Victory Song) in 2:22; 
and Dauntless, 3 (by Greentree Adios) in 2:32. For the 
aged horses: Mr& Budlong, ~p, 2:00.2~h, Lottie Thomas, ~p, 
2:04.2~h, Mighty Signal 2:03, Clever Braden, ~p, 2:01.1~h, 
and Glow Star, ~p, 2:02.3 have been in 2:35; Miss 
Demon Abbe, ~p, 1:59.3 has trotted in 2:26, and is expected to 
race at this gait; Carter Creed, ~p, 3, 2:01.1, Great Lullwater 
2:00.3, and Hi Jay, ~p, 2:05.1~h have been in 2:30; 
Tanker T&, 3, 2:05.3 is now wearing hopples and has trained in 
2:19; Stormy Dream, ~p, 2:01.3~h, Demon Abbe, ~p, 2:02, 
Dundeen B&, 4, 2:04.2~h, Claudia's Song, 3, 2:06.3~h, 
and (jet Fire, 4, 2:02.2 have been in 2:25; Maria Key, 2, 
2:06~h looked great in 2:22; Mocking Byrd, ~p, 2:01.1~h 
has been in 2:12, with a racing date approaching at Bay Meadows.

Dewey Urban has a clever green trotter in Dr& Orin I&, 
3 (by Yankee Hanover), his latest mile in 2:20; Victory Sun, 
~p, 2:04 has trained in 2:24; Early Sun, ~p, 2:02.3, Chester 
Maid 2:05, Dark Sun, ~p, 2:06.1, and Sun Tan Maid 
2:05.2 have been in 2:21.

The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun (we 
ran a survey to find out) but he's always on the lookout for new and 
better arms. He's more than a reader of outdoor articles; he's 
a real hunter and shooter, eager to improve his sport. Well, if you're 
that kind of sportsman we're here to help you. You've probably 
given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack, 
but it's not easy to decide on a new one. You still have time to 
drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most; the time 
to decide on them is now. As a Christmas service, I've taken a close 
look at this year's crop of new models. Here they are, with my 
comments and judgments. Read on, take your pick- and start dropping 
those hints.   First on my own list would be two arms- a rifle 
and a handgun- that qualify as new in the strictest sense. 
For me, a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute 
a truly new design. Such modifications are all for the best but 
it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change 
arms-making concepts.   Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker 
(under $110) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the 
modern theory of high-velocity fans; it's a short, light, quick-handling, 
fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug 
at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for 
our most popular big game- whitetail.   Ruger reports that 
on his recent African safari the little .44 Magnum cartridge was a 
real work horse. Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot, 
and the .44 Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob and wart hog with 
deadly efficiency; these are fairly large, tough animals. 
The deadliness of the .44 Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to 
me. At least five years ago, Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under 
double rifle for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model 
90 action in 20-gauge size. After figuring out how to regulate the 
barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this 
little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground 
test gallery. We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill 
Ruger in his first experiments: Three or four bullets would be 
placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, 
one could stray far out of the group.   Ruger learned that this 
was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting 
the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet. The new, jacketed slug 
in .44 Magnum corrected this. But even without jacketed bullets, I 
had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt 
that first year. Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that 
hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind 
the left foreleg at 60 yards. He moved only about 30 feet after 
the 240-grain slug hit him- and this was after the bullet had passed 
through a sapling.   Three more deer have fallen to this same 
gun, and all were one-shot kills. My double was made with standard-weight 
revolver barrels (before cutting to revolver length), and although 
it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than 
the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.   If ever 
a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter, this is it. The Deerstalker 
points with the ease, speed and precision of a fine imported
