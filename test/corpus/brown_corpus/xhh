_TO THE PIAZZA NAVONA AND PANTHEON_ 
These two walks take you through the {heart of Rome.} You will 
walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed in by massive <palazzi>. 
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed, 
a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish 
Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens. By seeing such varied places, 
both interesting and beautiful, you will become aware of the many 
different civilizations Rome has lived through, and in particular, get 
a feel of Renaissance Rome. You will realize why Rome is indeed 
the Eternal City.   Start on the Via d& Teatro di Marcello 
at the foot of the {Capitoline Hill.} The majestic circular 
tiers of stone of the {Theatre of Marcellus} give you some idea 
of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B&C&. 
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days. 
Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled 
his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.   Wander past 
the three superb {Columns of Apollo} by the arches of the theatre. 
The remains of the {Portico of Octavia} are now in front of 
you. Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via della Tribuna di 
Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo. 
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli, 
then proceed along the Via dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei. Here 
is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome, the {Fontana delle 
Tartarughe} or {"Fountain of the Tortoises".} It's typical 
of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find 
such an artistic work in the center of a little square. Stand here 
for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths, 
each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head 
of a dolphin. The figures have been executed so skillfully that one 
senses a great feeling of life and movement.   Opposite is the 
{Palazzo Mattei,} one of Rome's oldest palaces, now the headquarters 
of the {Italo-American Association.} Go inside for a closer 
look at a Renaissance palace. In the first courtyard there are 
some fine bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series of delightful 
terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall. The {Palazzo 
Caetani,} still inhabited by the Caetani family, adjoins the Palazzo 
Mattei.   Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross 
the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the {Piazza B& 
Cairoli,} where you should look in at the {Church of San Carlo 
ai Catinari} to see the frescoes on the ceiling. Follow the colorful 
and busy Via d& Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so. Now turn 
left at the Via dell' Arco del Monte to the Piazza dei Pellegrini. 
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo di Ferro will 
bring you to the {Palazzo Spada,} built in 1540 and now occupied 
by the {Council of State.} Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, 
and Rubens are on display (open 9:30-4:00).   Before you enter 
the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's facade. The great architect 
also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which 
connects the two courts. The large statue on the first floor is believed 
to be the {statue of Pompey} at the base of which Julius Caesar 
was stabbed to death (if so, the statue once stood in the senate 
house). (This is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.)

By tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard Borromini's 
unusual and fascinating trick in perspective. When you stand before 
the barrel-vaulted {colonnade} you have the impression that the statue 
at 
the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few 
feet away. The sense of perspective has been created by designing the 
length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade 
are much shorter than those in front. The gardens of the <palazzo,> 
shaded by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive. The courtyard 
is magnificently decorated.   From the Palazzo Spada you continue 
another block along the Via Capo di Ferro and Vicolo de Venti 
to the imposing {Palazzo Farnese,} begun in 1514 and considered 
by many to be the finest palace of all. Michelangelo was the most distinguished 
of several noted architects who helped design it. Today it 
is occupied by the {French Embassy.} Its lovely seventeenth-century 
ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously 
high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays 
(11:00-12:00 noon). Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris 
and Rome designed by Lurcat.   Directly in front of the palace 
along the Via d& Baullari you will come to the {Campo di Fiori,} 
the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance 
Rome. Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit, 
vegetable, and flower market. Continue on the Via d& Baullari to 
the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred 
yards to the {Church of Sant' Andrea della Valle.} As you 
approach the church on the Via d& Baullari you are passing within 
yards of the remains of the {Roman Theatre of Pompey,} near which 
is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated. 
The dome of the church is, outside of {St& Peter's,} 
one of the largest in Rome. Opera lovers will be interested to learn 
that this church was the scene for the first act of <Tosca>.

At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele /2,, 
walk along the Corso del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards, 
then turn left on the Via dei Canestrani to enter the splendid {Piazza 
Navona,} one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.   Your 
first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains, 
its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored 
buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness- particularly 
welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have 
followed since starting this walk.   The site of the oblong 
piazza is {Domitian's ancient stadium,} which was probably used 
for horse and chariot races. For centuries it was the location of historic 
festivals and open-air sports events. From the seventeenth to 
the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in 
the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated 
square in their carriages.   Giovanni Bernini's {"Fountain 
of the Rivers",} in the center of the piazza, is built around 
a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes 
and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner, denoting four 
great rivers from different continents- the Danube, the Ganges, the 
Nile, and the Plate. The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, 
perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure 
from her sight the baroque facade of the {Church of Sant' Agnese 
in Agone}, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini. 
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can 
sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch the fountains in the square. The 
scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about 
Rome. Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.

Take the Via di S& Agnese in Agone, next to the church 
and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about 
two hundred yards to reach the beautiful {Church of Santa Maria della 
Pace.} Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael 
and a chapel designed by Michelangelo. The church's cloisters 
are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations.   Now 
return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the 
Corsia Agonale; in a moment cross the Corso del Rinascimento. 
In front of you is the {Palazzo Madama,} once belonging to the 
Medici and now the {Italian Senate.} Walk by the side of the 
palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come 
to the {Piazza della Rotonda.} You are now facing the {Pantheon,} 
the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the 
days of ancient Rome.   This circular edifice, constructed by 
Agrippa in B&C& 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor 
Hadrian. It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century. 
As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the 
Temple of Isis, you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian 
columns.   The Pantheon's interior, still in its original 
form, is truly majestic and an architectural triumph. Its {rotunda} 
forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from 
the floor to the ceiling. The only means of interior light is the 
twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous {dome.} Standing 
before the tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance, when 
shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple, you are 
once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of 
Rome.   As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to 
the right, the Via del Seminario, a block to {Sant' Ignazio,} 
one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city. (Along the way 
there, about one hundred yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant, 
{La Sacrestia,} where you can have the best pizza in Rome.) 
The curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church 
seems like a stage set. This is one of the most charming little 
squares in this part of Rome. One block along the Via de Burro (in 
front of the church) will bring you to the {Stock Exchange} in 
the old {Temple of Neptune.} A few yards farther, on the Via 
dei Bergamaschi, is the {Piazza Colonna.} The great column from 
which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus 
Aurelius.   You are now at the {Corso,} though narrow, one 
of Rome's busiest streets. Horse races took place here in the Middle 
Ages.   If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have 
the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso 
for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings- 
mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries- in the 
{Palazzo Doria} (open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00-1:00). 
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where 
the family still lives.   Otherwise, cross over the Corso and 
walk a block or so to the left. You will come to {Alemagna,} a 
delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly 
noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries. 
Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the 
place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome. _TO THE SPANISH 
STEPS_ The second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken 
after lunch, so that you will reach the {Pincian Hill} when 
the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best. 
Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church 
member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale 
to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality. I myself 
have witnessed and endured it more than once. The businessmen and racketeers 
also have a story. And so do the prostitutes. (And this is not, 
perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward 
black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they 
are nearly all downtown.)   It is hard, on the other hand, to blame 
the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably 
innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves. 
He, too, believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended 
when they are not taken for the deed. He has never, himself, done 
anything for which to be hated- which of us has?- and yet he is 
facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly see him dead, and he 
knows it. There is no way for him not to know it: there are few things 
under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt 
and hatred of a people. He moves through Harlem, therefore, like 
an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country; which is precisely 
what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes. 
And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company: 
the people who are watching him know why, too. Any street meeting, 
sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as 
its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white 
domination. And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and 
jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination. The white policeman 
standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center 
of the revolution now occurring in the world. He is not prepared 
for it- naturally, nobody is- and, what is possibly much more to the 
point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the 
black people around him. Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard 
grain of imagination, something must seep in. He cannot avoid observing 
that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of
