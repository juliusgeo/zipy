through down here".   It all did look very efficient and 
shipshape. There was no question of that. "By the way", said Mr& 
Blatz, packing his tools into a battered carrier, "them power tools 
needs extra voltage. I guess you know about that. Before you use 
'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need 
a new fuse box for the extra circuits. That ain't too bad 'ceptin' 
the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do 
nothin'".   Instead of being depressed by this news, Mr& 
Crombie was actually relieved. At least the moment was postponed when 
he had to face the mystery of the power tools. He followed Mr& 
Blatz up the cellar stairs. As usual, Mrs& Crombie was standing 
in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils. Mr& Blatz sat down 
in the only unoccupied kitchen chair.   "Well", he said, "got 
your man fixed up nice down there. He oughta be able to build a 
new house with all them contraptions". Mr& Crombie watched his 
wife with an anxious expression. "I was just sayin' to him that I'm 
all ready now for anything else you want done". Mr& Crombie 
couldn't remember his saying any such thing.   "Oh, that's 
wonderful", cried Mrs& Crombie. "I have a thousand things 
for you to do. Doors that won't open, and doors that won't close 
and shelves and broken **h"   "But those are the things I built 
the <workshop> for", protested Mr& Crombie. "Those are 
the things <I> can do, now that I'm set up".   "I've 
been waiting to get these things done for months", she said. "We 
won't live long enough if I wait for you, besides which you don't 
need to worry- there'll be plenty more". But the discussion was 
academic. Mr& Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf 
above the kitchen sink. 

#AMBIGUITY#

Nothing in English has been ridiculed as much as the 
ambiguous use of words, unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences. 
Ben Franklin said, "Clearly spoken, Mr& Fogg. You explain English 
by Greek". Richard Brinsley Sheridan said, "I think the 
interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two". And a witty 
American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more 
true today, "Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except 
when he can't understand his own meaning".   There are many 
types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians 
under such names as amphibology, parisology, and other ologies. 
In common parlance they would be described as misses- misinterpreters, 
misunderstanders, misdirectors and kindred misdeeds.   One species 
of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition. "Did 
you or did you not say what I said you said, because Jane said you 
never said what I said"?   Another woman, addressing Christmas 
cards, said to her husband: "We sent them one last year but 
they didn't send us one, so they probably won't send us one this 
year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't 
last year, don't you think, or shall we"?   Such ambiguous 
exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded, and 
they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours. Ambiguity 
of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself 
in. "I'm terribly upset", she told a girl-friend. "I wrote 
Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't 
mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind- and he 
seems to have misunderstood me". Evidently Bill was another of those 
men who simply don't understand women.   Another case involves 
a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician. "Mr& Jones, 
you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted 
the contradiction of your original statement. Now would you care 
to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it"?   Questions 
like this, framed in verbal fog, are perhaps the only kind that 
have ever stumped an experienced politician. They recall Byron's 
classic comment: "I wish he would explain his explanation". 
Similarly, when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion, 
Lincoln refused to make any further statement. "I fear explanations 
explanatory of things explained", he said, leaving the biter bit- 
and bitter.   The obscurity of politicians may not always be 
as innocent as it looks. "Senator", said an interviewer, "your 
constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how 
you stand on the question". "Good"! replied the Senator. "It 
took me five hours to write it that way".   The <misplaced 
modifier> is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity 
than in the breach. This creates an amusing effect because its 
position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word. A verse 
familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain: "I saw a man once 
beat 
his wife When on a drunken spree. Now can you tell me who was 
drunk- The man, his wife, or me"?   The "wooden-leg" 
gag of vaudeville, another standby of this sort, had endless variations.

""There's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith". 
"What's the name of his other leg""?   Another 
stock vaudeville gag ran: "Mother is home sick in bed with the 
doctor".   When radio came in, it continued the misplaced modifier 
in its routines as a standard device.   ""Do you see that 
pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on"? "I see 
the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on"".   In 
recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus 
the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline. 
In one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the 
family addressing the doorman: "Excuse me, but when we came out 
we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind".

Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips. 
Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest 
that "snapshots must be of a person not larger than **f inches".

Classified ads are also chockfull of <misrelated constructions>. 
Readers of the <Reader's Digest> are familiar with such 
items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips, like the ad in 
a California paper that advertised "House for rent. View takes in 
five counties, two bedrooms".   Since brevity is the soul of 
ambiguity as well as wit, newspaper <headlines> continually provide 
us with amusing samples. "Officials Meet on Rubbish. Many Shapes 
in Bathtubs. Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married".

Apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese, journalism contributes 
a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising 
matter.   A weekly newspaper reported a local romance: 
"**h and the couple were married last Saturday, thus ending a friendship 
which began in their schooldays".   An item in the letters 
column of a newspaper renewed a subscription, adding: "I personally 
enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband".   Then there 
was the caterer's ad which read: "ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED 
OR HAVING AN AFFAIR? We have complete facilities to accommodate 
200 people".   The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the 
<anatomical>. This slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous 
English always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite 
means what it seems to say. Samples: He walked in upon her invitation. 
She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance. He kissed her 
back.   Not without good reason has the anatomical been called 
jocular journalese. In news items a man is less often shot in the body 
or head than in the suburbs. "While Henry Morgan was escorting 
Miss Vera Green from the church social last Saturday night, a savage 
dog attacked them and bit Mr& Morgan on the public square".

Such items recall the California journalist who reported an 
accident involving a movie star: "The area in which Miss N- was 
injured is spectacularly scenic".   The double meaning in the 
anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device, as in the gags of 
Weber and Fields. When a witness at court was asked if he had been 
kicked in the ensuing rumpus, he replied, "No, it was in the stomach". 
Strangely enough, this always brought the house down.   Apart 
from journalese and vaudeville gags, the anatomical is also found 
in jocular literature. A conscientious girl became the secretary of 
a doctor. Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's 
notes on an emergency case. It read: "Shot in the lumbar 
region". After a moment of thought, her mind cleared and, in the 
interest of clarity, she typed into the record: "Shot in the woods".

There are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling 
modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations. 
At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine 
points of serving. "I want the fish served whole, with head and 
tail", the epicure explained, "and serve it with lemon in mouth". 
The maid demurred. "That's silly- lemon in mouth", she said. 
But since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most 
fashionable dinners, the girl reluctantly agreed. So she brought the 
fish in whole, and she carried a lemon in her mouth.   Another 
specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department 
store. She said to the saleslady, "I want a dress to put on 
around the house". The puzzled saleslady inquired, "How large is 
your house, Madam"?   This saleslady was a failure in the 
dress department and was transferred to the shoe department. When a 
customer asked for alligator shoes, she said, "What size is your alligator"?

The <comic indefinite> comprises an extensive 
class of comedy. One species is restricted to statements which are neither 
explicit nor precise regarding a particular person, place, time 
or thing. A woman met a famous author at a literary tea. "Oh, I'm 
so delighted to meet you", she gushed. "It was only the other 
day that I saw something of yours, about something or other, in some 
magazine".   This baffling lack of distinct details recalls the 
secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to 
answer if anyone called in his absence. "I may be back", he explained, 
"and then again, I may not". The girl nodded understandingly. 
"Yes, sir", she said, "is that definite"?   An 
old-fashioned 
mother said to her modern daughter, "You must have gotten 
in quite late last night, dear. Where were you"? The daughter replied, 
"Oh, I had dinner with- well, you don't know him but he's 
awfully nice- and we went to a couple of places- I don't 
suppose you've heard of them- and we finished up at a cute little 
night club- I forget the name of it. Why, it's all right, isn't 
it, Mother"? Her woolly-minded parent agreed. "Of course, dear", 
she said. "It's only that I like to know where you go".

No less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's 
sermon. "Dearly beloved", he preached, "unless you repent of 
your sins in a measure, and become converted to a degree, you will, 
I regret to say, be damned to a more or less extent". This clergyman 
should have referred to Shakespeare's dictum: "So-so is a good, 
very good, very excellent maxim. And yet it is not. It is but so-so".

<Indefinite reference> also carries double-meaning 
where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another. A 
news item described the launching of a ship: "Completing the ceremony, 
the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her 
stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea".   This 
is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor 
pool: "Four trucks to Fort Mason gym, 7:30 tonight, for hauling 
girls to dance. The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off".

A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a 
minor public official who had just died. "What are my chances for taking 
Joe's place"? he asked. "If you can fix it up with the 
undertaker", returned the politician, "it's all right with me".
