with guns", the elder man told Rickards. The pilot radioed 
El Paso International Airport with just that message. But, he 
told the "skyjackers", the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach 
Havana; they would have to refuel at El Paso.   Most passengers 
didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground. 
Jerry McCauley of Sacramento, Calif&, one of some twenty Air Force 
recruits on board, awoke from a nap in confusion. "The old man 
came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers 
to go to Cuba", McCauley said, "and like a nut I raised my hand. 
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter".   What the man 
wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages, along with the crew. 
They chose four: Jack Casey, who works for Continental Airlines 
in Houston; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island, Wash&; 
Pfc& 
Truman Cleveland of St& Augustine. Fla&, and Leonard Gilman, 
a former college boxer and veteran of the U&S& Immigration 
Service Border Patrol. Everybody else was allowed to file off the 
plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a&m&. 
They found a large welcoming group- El Paso policemen, Border Patrol, 
sheriff's deputies, and ~FBI men, who surged around the 
plane with rifles and submarine guns. Other ~FBI men, talking with 
the pilot from the tower, conspired with him to delay the proposed 
flight to Havana. The ground crew, which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty 
minutes, took fully three hours. Still more time was consumed while 
the pilot, at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert 
Six, tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for 
a propeller-driven Douglas ~DC-7.   Actually, the officers 
on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with 
any kind of an airplane; they had orders to that effect straight 
from President Kennedy, who thought at first, as did most others, that 
it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over 
the 707. Mr& Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the 
attempt to steal the plane, kept in touch throughout by telephone. At 
one time, while still under the impression that he was dealing with a 
Cuban plot, the President talked about invoking a total embargo on 
trade with Cuba.   As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas 
sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains, police got close 
enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment. From the 
luggage, they learned that the two air pirates, far from being Cubans, 
were native Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden, 
50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz&, and his son, Cody, 
16, a high-school junior. _TENSION_ The heat and strain began 
to tell on the Beardens. The father, by accident or perhaps to show, 
as he said, "we mean business", took the .45 and fired a slug 
between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons. At 7:30 a&m&, 
more than three hours after landing, the Beardens gave an ultimatum:

Take off or see the hostages killed.   The tower 
cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a&m&, and Captain Rickards 
began taxiing toward the runway.   Several police cars, loaded with 
armed officers, raced alongside, blazing away at the tires of the 
big jet. The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard 
engines; the plane slowed to a halt. Ambulances, baggage trucks, 
and cars surrounded it.   The day wore on. At 12:50 p&m& 
a ramp was rolled up to the plane. A few minutes later, ~FBI agent 
Francis Crosby, talking fast, eased up the ramp to the plane, unarmed. 
While Crosby distracted the Beardens, stewardesses Carnegey 
and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door. So did hostages Casey, 
Cleveland, and Mullen. That left only the four crew members, Crosby, 
and Border Patrolman Gilman, all unarmed, with the Beardens. 
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand, the other in a hip pocket. 
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance. He caught 
officer Simmons' eye, nodded toward young Bearden, and- "I 
swung my right as hard as I could. Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy 
and it was all over".   Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 
p&m&, the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges 
of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines. 
(Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro, and live high 
in Cuba.) Back home in Coolidge, Ariz&, his 36-year-old wife, 
Mary, said: "I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for 
jobs". 

#CONGRESS: MORE MUSCLE#

Taking precedence over all other 
legislation on 
Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of 
the nation. The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed 
speed and unanimity to pass- 85 to 0- the largest peacetime 
defense budget in U&S& history.   With the money all 
but in hand, however, the Administration indicated that, instead of 
the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested, 
the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000. The "hold-back", 
as Pentagon mutterers labeled it, apparently was a temporary 
expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually 
and, thus, the new funds spent prudently.   In all, the Senate 
signed a check for $46.7 billion, which not only included the extra 
$3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy, but 
tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for. (The 
Senate, on its own, decided to provide additional ~B-52 and other 
long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command.) The House, which 
had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent 
call for more, was expected to go along with the increased defense 
budget in short order.   In other areas, Congressional action last 
week included:   @ The Senate (by voice vote) and the House 
(by 224-170) passed and sent to the White House the compromise 
farm bill which the President is expected to sign, not too unhappily.

@ The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's 
health, welfare, and labor activities.   Debate on the 
all-important foreign-aid 
bill, with its controversial long-range proposals, 
had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend. White House 
legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact. 

#FOOD: STEW A LA MULLIGATAWNY#

Most members of the U&S& Senate, 
because they are human, like to eat as high on the hog as they 
can. But, because they are politicians, they like to talk as poor-mouth 
as the lowliest voter. As a result, ever since 1851 when the Senate 
restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building, the senators 
have never ceased to grumble about the food- even while they 
opposed every move that might improve it.   Over the years, enlivened 
chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho 
potatoes, the menu has pursued its drab all-American course. Individual 
senators, with an eye to the voters back home, occasionally introduced 
smelts from Michigan, soft-shell crabs from Maryland, oysters 
from Washington, grapefruit from Florida. But plain old bean soup, 
served daily 
since the turn of the century (at the insistence of the 
late Sen& Fred Dubois of Idaho), made clear to the citizenry that 
the Senate's stomach was in the right place.   In a daring 
stroke, the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute 
cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel.

{Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly 
reports on operation of the turnpikes}.   {Long-term trend 
of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward. Higher toll rates 
also are helping boost revenues}.   {Result is a better prospect 
for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative}.

Things are looking up these days for many of the 
State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road 
bonds.   traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing. 
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll 
gates.   As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes, investors 
who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright 
speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.

Another 
result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these 
tax-exempt bonds.   Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local 
governments hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard 
+ Poor's average. On balance, prices of those bonds have slipped 
a bit since then. However, in the same three-month period, toll-road 
bonds, as a group, have bucked this trend. On these bonds, price rises 
since February 21 easily outnumber price declines. 

#TAX-FREE RETURNS.# 

Investors, however, still see an element of more-than-ordinary 
risk in the toll-road bonds. You find the evidence of that in the 
chart on this page.   Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling 
at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent, 
or very close to that. And this is true in the case of some turnpikes 
on which revenues have risen close to, or beyond, the point at which 
the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on 
the bonds.   That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be 
had on good corporation bonds. It's not much more, in fact, than 
the return that is offered on U& S& Treasury bonds.   For 
investors whose income is taxed at high rates, though, a tax-free yield 
of 4 per cent is high. It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried 
investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for 
a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income. 

#SWELLING 
TRAFFIC.#

A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the 
most recent 12-month period- ending in February or March- shows 
what is happening. The report is based on a survey by Blyth + Company, 
investment bankers.   Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in 
net revenues during the period.   And there is the bright note: 
The gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late 
in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession. Many 
of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.   Indication: 
The long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.   Look, 
for example, at the Ohio Turnpike. Traffic on that road slumped 
sharply in January and February, as compared with those same months 
in 1960. Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues- 
after operating costs.   As a result, the road's net revenues 
in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest 
payments on the turnpike bonds. That was up from 173 per cent 
in the preceding 12 months.   That same pattern of earnings shows 
up on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Operating revenues were off in 
the first three months of 1961, but up for the 12 months ending in March. 
Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.   For the 
year, the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs, against 121 
per cent in the preceding period. The road's engineers look for further 
improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston. 

#SLOW SUCCESSES.# 

Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough 
to prove what they can do. The 187-mile Illinois State Toll 
Highway, 
for example, was not opened over its entire length until December, 1958. 
In the 12 months ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough 
to cover 64 per cent of its interest load- with the remainder paid
