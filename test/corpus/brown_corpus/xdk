with Mr& Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers, seemed 
to be fine shape.

THE Symphony of the Air, greatly assisted by Van Cliburn, 
last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall 
off to a good start. At the same time the orchestra announced that 
next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie, and 
that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs, repeating each 
of them in five different communities.   This news, announced 
by Jerome Toobin, the orchestra's administrative director, brought 
applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall. They showed they 
were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there 
so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln 
Center of the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra 
and the Boston Symphony.   This season the orchestra has already 
taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription 
concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County 
Center in White Plains. The details of the suburban concerts 
next season, and the centers in which they will be given, will be announced 
later, Mr& Toobin said. #@#

The concertos that Van 
Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return 
from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky, the Rachmaninoff 
Third, and the Prokofieff Third. It was pleasant last night, therefore, 
to hear him do something else: a concerto he has recently recorded, 
"The Emperor".   The young Texas pianist can make 
great chords ring out as well as anyone, so last night the massive sonorities 
of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him. But they 
were not what distinguished his performance. The elements that did 
were the introspective slow movement, the beautiful transition to the 
third movement, and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger 
moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo.   Mr& 
Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne. 
Alfred Wallenstein, the conductor, sensitive accompanist that 
he is, picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of 
broodinf, poetic mystery. The collaboration was remarkable, as it was 
in both the other movements, too. #@#

Mr& Wallenstein, who 
will lead all of the concerts in the cycle, also conducted the "Leonore" 
Overture No& 3 and the Fourth Symphony. The orchestra 
was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively. And although 
there was plenty of vigor in the performance, the ensemble was at 
its best when the playing was soft and lyrical, yet full of the suppressed 
tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven. Igor Oistrakh 
will be the next soloist on Feb& 4.

THERE are times when one suspects that the songs that are 
dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be 
better than many of those that are left in. Today, in the era of the 
integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all 
development of the show, it is understandable that a song, no matter 
how excellent it may be on its own terms, is cut out because it does 
not perform the function required of it.   In the more casually 
constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties 
there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song 
of merit. Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' "The 
Man I Love". Deemed too static when it was first heard in "Lady 
Be Good" in Philadelphia in 1924, it was dropped from the score. 
It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version 
of "Strike Up the Band" and again abandoned shortly before the 
entire show was given up. It finally reached Broadway in the second 
and successful version of "Strike Up the Band" in 1929. (Still 
another song in "Strike Up the Band"- "I've Got a Crush 
on You"- was retrieved from a 1928 failure, "Treasure Girl".) 

#SECOND CHANCE#

Like the Gershwins, Richard Rodgers and 
Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them. If one 
of Mr& Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than 
interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure, Mr& Hart 
was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance 
in another show.   Several of these double entries have been 
collected by Ben Bagley and Michael McWhinney, along with Rodgers 
and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York 
and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly 
heard Rodgers and Hart repertory, in a delightfully refreshing 
album, {Rodgers and Hart Revisited} (Spruce Records, 505 Fifth 
Avenue, New York).   Among the particular gems in this collection 
is the impudent opening song of "The Garrick Gaieties", 
an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from 
Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed; Dorothy Loudon's 
raucous listing of the attractions "At the Roxy Music Hall" from 
"I Married an Angel"; and the incisive style with which Charlotte 
Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of "I Blush", 
a song that was cut from "A Connecticut Yankee".   Altogether 
fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by 
a quintet of able vocalists. Norman Paris has provided them with extremely 
effective orchestral accompanimen   Turning to the current 
musical season on Broadway, the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals, 
{How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying}, 
has been transferred to an original cast album (R& C& A& Victor 
~LOC 1066; stereo ~LSO 1066) that has some entertaining 
moments, although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited 
by the show might lead one to expect. Robert Morse, singing with comically 
plaintive earnestness, carries most of the burden and is responsible 
for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score.   Rudy 
Vallee, who shares star billing with Mr& Morse, makes only two 
appearances. He shares with Mr& Morse a parody of the college anthems 
he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia 
Martin, a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice. 
In general, Mr& Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist 
than he has as composer.   Like Mr& Loesser, Jerry Herman 
is both composer and lyriist for {Milk and Honey} (R& 
C& 
A& Victor ~LOC 1065; stereo ~LSO 1065), but in this 
case it is the music that stands above the lyrics. For this story of 
an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel, Mr& Herman 
has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles. 

#RESOURCEFUL VOICES#

There are the full-bodied, resourceful 
voices of Robert Weede, Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the 
most of Mr& Herman's lilting melodies and, for an occasional 
change of pace, the bright humor of Molly Picon. Mr& Herman has 
managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American 
ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both 
idioms.   Not content to create only the music and lyrics, Noe^l 
Coward also wrote the book and directed {Sail Away} (Capitol 
~WAO 1643; stereo ~SWAO 1643), a saga of life on a 
cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr& Coward's more 
memorable works. The melodies flow along pleasantly, as Mr& Coward's 
songs usually do, but his lyrics have a tired, cut-to-a-familiar-pattern 
quality. Elaine Stritch, who sings with a persuasively 
warm huskiness, belts some life into most of her songs, but the other 
members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr& Coward's songs.

WITH three fine Russian films in recent months on World 
War /2,- "The House I Live In", "The Cranes Are Flying" 
and "Ballad of a Soldier"- we had every right to expect 
a real Soviet block-buster in "The Day the War Ended". It 
simply isn't, not by a long shot. The Artkino presentation, with English 
titles, opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre. #@# 

Make no mistake, this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import- 
aptly grave, carefully 
written, performed and directed. In describing the initial Allied 
occupation of a middle-sized German city, the picture has color, pictorial 
pull and genuinely moving moments. Told strictly from the viewpoint 
of the Russian conquerors, the film compassionately peers over 
the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple, at both sides of the conflict's 
aftermath.   Unfortunately, the whole picture hinges on this 
romance, at the expense of everything else. Tenderly and rather tediously, 
the camera rivets on the abrupt, deep love of a pretty nurse 
and a uniformed teacher, complicated by nothing more than a friend they 
don't want to hurt. It's the old story, war or no war, and more 
than one viewer may recall Hollywood's "Titanic", several seasons 
back, when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of 
a society dilettante.   Not that the picture is superficial. Under 
Yakov Segal's direction, it begins stirringly, as crouching Soviet 
and Nazi troops silently scan each other, waiting for the first 
surrender gesture. One high-up camera shot is magnificent, as the Germans 
straggle from a cathedral, dotting a huge, cobblestone square, 
and drop their weapons. 

#RING OF BRIGHT WATER, BY GAVIN MAXWELL. 211 PAGES. DUTTON. $5.# 

Only 
once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic 
sense of sharing a rare experience. "Ring of Bright Water" by 
Gavin Maxwell is just that- a haunting, warmly personal chronicle 
of a man, an otter, and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands.

"He has married me with **h a ring of bright 
water", 
begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title, 
and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the 
author conveys. The place is Camusfearna, the site of a long-vanished 
sea-village opposite the isle of Skye. It is a land of long fjords, 
few people, a single-lane road miles away- and of wild stags, Greylag 
geese, wild swans, dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters. 
How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna, his furnishing 
the empty house with beach-drift, the subtle changes in season over 
ten years, is a moving experience. Just the evocations of time and 
place, of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today 
seems almost lost, would be enough.   But it isn't. There 
is Mijbil, an otter who travelled with Maxwell- and gave Maxwell's 
name to a new species- from the Tigris marshes to his London 
flat. It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more 
engaging animal in all literature. This is not only a compliment to 
Mijbil, of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings 
in the book, but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened 
otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London, then by train 
(where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap) 
to Camusfearna, with affectionate detail.   Mij, as his owner 
was soon to learn, had strange, inexplicable habits. He liked to nip 
ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth. He preferred 
sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow. Systematically he 
would open and ransack drawers. Given a small ball or marbles, he would 
invent games and play by himself for hours. With curiosity and elan, 
he explored every inch of glen, beach and burn, once stranding himself 
for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting 
with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell, who nearly lost his life 
in doing so.   A year and a day of this idyll is described for the 
reader, one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality 
is charted, but self-discovery as well. In the solitude of Camusfearna 
there had been no loneliness. "To be quite alone where there
