short-story plot has been overworked. The son and heir of a prominent 
family marries a girl who has tell-tale shadows on the half-moons of 
her finger nails. In time she presents her aristocratic husband with 
a coal-black child. Is the world better for having this idea thrust upon 
it? Will argument and debate decide its truth or falsity?

For answers to such questions we must turn to the anthropologists, 
the biologists, the historians, the psychologists, and the sociologists. 
Long ago they consigned the notions of Kyne and Dixon to the scrap 
heap.   False ideas surfeit another sector of our life. For 
several generations much fiction has appeared dealing with the steprelationship. 
The stepmother, almost without exception, has been presented 
as a cruel ogress. Children, conditioned by this mistaken notion, 
have feared stepmothers, while adults, by their antagonistic attitudes, 
have made the role of the substitute parents a difficult one. Debate 
is not likely to resolve the tensions and make the lot of the stepchild 
a happier one. Research, on the other hand, has shown many stepmothers 
to be eminently successful, some far better than the real mothers.

Helen Deutsch informed us (<The Psychology of Women>, 
Vol& /2,, 434) that in all cultures "the term 'stepmother' 
automatically evokes deprecatory implications", a conclusion accepted 
by many. Will mere debate on that proposition, even though it be 
free and untrammeled, remove the dross and leave a residue of refined 
gold? That is questionable, to say the least. Research into several 
cultures has proven her position to be a mistaken one.   Most 
assuredly ideas are invaluable. But ideas, just for the sake of having 
them, are not enough. In the 1930's, cures for the depression literally 
flooded Washington. For a time the President received hundreds 
of them every day, most of them worthless.   Ideas need to be 
tested, and not merely by argument and debate. When some question arises 
in the medical field concerning cancer, for instance, we do not 
turn to free and open discussion as in a political campaign. We have 
recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory. The 
merits of the Salk anti-polio vaccine were not established on the 
forensic platform or in newspaper editorials, but in the laboratory 
and by tests in the field on thousands of children.   Our presidential 
campaigns provide much debate and argument. But is the result 
new barnsful of tested knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence 
solve our domestic and international problems? Man, we are 
told, is endowed with reason and is capable of distinguishing good from 
bad. But what a super-Herculean task it is to winnow anything of value 
from the mud-beplastered arguments used so freely, particularly since 
such common use is made of cliches and stereotypes, in themselves 
declarations of intellectual bankruptcy.   We are reminded, however, 
that freedom of thought and discussion, the unfettered exchange 
of ideas, is basic under our form of government.   Assuredly in 
our political campaigns there is freedom to think, to examine any and 
all issues, and to speak without restraint. No holds are barred. But 
have the results been heartening? May we state with confidence that 
in such an exhibition a republic will find its greatest security?

We must not forget, to be sure, that free discussion and debate 
have produced beneficial results. In truth, we can say that this broke 
the power of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was finally exposed 
in full light to the American people. If he had been "liquidated" 
in some way, he would have become a martyr, a rallying point for people 
who shared his ideas. Debate in the political arena can be productive 
of good. But it is a clumsy and wasteful process: it can produce 
negative results but not much that is positive. Debate rid us of 
McCarthy but did not give us much that is positive. It did something 
to clear the ground, but it erected no striking new structure; it 
did not even provide the architect's plan for anything new. 
In the field of the natural sciences, scientifically verified data are 
quite readily available and any discussion can be shortened with good 
results. In the field of the social sciences a considerable fund of 
tested knowledge has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage.

By no means would we discourage the production of ideas: 
they provide raw materials with which to work; they provide stimulations 
that lead to further production. We would establish no censorship. 
The President's personality would have opened that office to him. 
And for the first time a representative of the highest office in the 
land would have been liable to the charge that he had attempted to make 
it a successorship by inheritance. It is testimony to the deep respect 
in which Mr& Eisenhower was held by members of all parties that 
the moral considerations raised by his approach to the matter were 
not explicitly to be broached.   These began to be apparent in a 
press conference held during the second illness in order that the consulting 
specialists might clarify the President's condition for the 
nation. And if Howard Rutstein felt impelled thereafter to formulate 
the ethics of the medical profession, his article in the <Atlantic 
Monthly> accomplished a good deal more. It forced us to fix the responsibility 
for the position in which all medical commentators had been 
placed. The discussion of professional ethics inevitably reminded 
us that in the historical perspective the President's decision will 
finally clarify itself as a moral, rather than a medical, problem. Because 
the responsibility for resolving the issue lay with the President, 
rather than with his doctors, nothing raises more surely for us 
the difficulties simple goodness faces in dealing with complex moral problems 
under political pressure. For the President had dealt with the 
matter humbly, in what he conceived as the democratic way. But the 
problem is one which gives us the measure of a man, rather than a group 
of men, whether a group of doctors, a group of party members assembled 
at a dinner to give their opinion, or the masses of the voters.

Any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in 
the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive 
it as the central issue will at least resolve our confusions about the 
chaotic and misleading results of the earnestness of both doctors and 
President in a situation which should never have arisen. It was a 
response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition 
which resulted in attempts at prediction. In no other situation 
would a group of doctors, struggling competently to improve the life 
expectancy of a man beloved by the world, be subjected to such merciless 
and persistent questioning, and before they were prepared to demonstrate 
the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind 
the problems it faces. And though we can look back now and see their 
errors, we can look back also to the ultimate error.   It recurred 
in the press conferences: the President's remarks about his running 
developed a singular tone, one which we find in few statements 
made by public individuals on such a matter. The press conference became 
a stage which betrayed the drift of his private thinking, rather than 
his convictions. He commented- thoughtfully, a reporter told us- 
that it was "not too important for the individual how he ends up". 
He gave us a simile to explain his admission that even at the worst 
period of his second illness it never occurred to him there was any 
renewed question about his running: as in the Battle of the Bulge, 
he had no fears about the outcome until he read the American newspapers. 
Yet the attitude that the fate of the Presidency demands in such 
a situation is quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed 
with battles to be fought, regardless of the consequences. In this 
case others should not have had to raise the doubts and fears. The 
Presidency demands an incisive awareness of the larger implications 
of the death of any incumbent. It is of the utmost importance to the 
people of America and of the world how their governing President "ends 
up" during the four years of his term. Only when that term is 
ended and he is a private citizen again can he be permitted the freedom 
and the courage to discount the dangers of his death. Ironically enough, 
in this instance such personal virtues were a luxury.   At 
the national and international level, then, what is the highest kind 
of morality for the private citizen represents an instance of political 
immorality. And we had the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the 
moral and the political progressed amid the events which concern us. 
For the tone of the editorials which greeted Mr& Eisenhower's 
original announcement of his running had been strangely disquieting. 
Neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeaks a people's intuitive 
sense of the fitness of things at climactic moments nor the vital argumentation 
betraying its sense that something significant has transpired 
was in evidence. Nothing testifies more clearly to that cleavage than 
the peculiar editorial page appearing in a July issue of <Life Magazine>, 
the issue which also carried the second announcement of the 
candidacy. The double editorial on two aspects of "The U& S& 
Spirit" was subtly calculated to suggest a moral sanction for gambles 
great as well as small, reflecting popular approval of this questionable 
attitude toward the highest office in the land. "The Moral 
Creed" and "The Will to Risk" live happily together, if we 
do not examine where the line is to be drawn. "I may possibly be a 
greater risk than is the normal person of my age", the President had 
said on February 29th of the election year, ignoring the fact that 
no one of his age had ever lived out another term. "My doctors assure 
me that this increased percentage of risk is not great". But by 
the time the risk was doubled, events had dismissed from his mind both 
increased percentages and a previously stated intention of considering 
carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza. Only infrequently 
did the situation color his thinking. Ironically no president 
we have had would have regretted more than President Eisenhower the 
possibility to which his own words, in the press conference held at 
the beginning of August, testified: that unable as he was himself 
to say his running was best for the country, unconsciously he had placed 
his party before his nation.   So it is that we relive his opening 
statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy 
of the present. No consideration of risk urges itself upon him 
now: for this is what the mind does with the ideas on which it has not 
properly focussed. Yet with a mind less shallow, if less sharp, than 
some of the fortune-happy syndicates which back him, he feels what 
he cannot formulate; and we watch him amid the overtones which suggest 
he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voters. Moving 
as he is into the phase of the campaign which demands conviction of 
him, he adopts a position that is morally indefensible. He ascribes 
to the mercy of God the peace which this personal matter- the assurance 
that he can physically sustain the burden of the office longer 
than any individual in the history of our nation has been able to do- 
has brought him. What is simply an opinion formed in defiance of the 
laws of human probability, whether or not it is later confirmed, has 
become by September of the election year "a firm conviction". 
As 
a means of silencing a discussion which ought to have taken place, the 
statement is an effective one: we sympathize with the universal confusion 
which gives rise to such convictions. But it is also the climax 
to one of the absorbing chapters in our current political history.

In assigning to God the responsibility which he learned could 
not rest with his doctors, Eisenhower gave evidence of that weakening 
of the moral intuition which was to characterize his administration 
in the years to follow. In any other man this reassurance to the electorate 
would have caused us a profound moral shock. About this man we 
had to think twice. We knew that it was, as reassurance, the ironic 
fruit of a deeply moral nature. But the fact remains that even the unconscious 
acceptance of himself as a man of destiny divinely protected 
must be censored in any man who evades the responsibility for his major 
decisions, and thus for imposing his will on the people. And in the 
context of drifting personal utterances we have examined, there was 
occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasions. When the possibility 
that he had not given reconsideration to so weighty a decision 
seemed 
to disconcert his questioners, Mr& Eisenhower was known to 
make his characteristic statement to the press that he was not going 
to talk about the matter any more. Thinking had stopped; it was not 
to be resumed.   The portrait that had developed, fragmentarily
