_WASHINGTON_- Rep& Frelinghuysen, ~R-5th Dist&, had a 
special reason for attending the reception at the Korean Embassy for 
Gen& Chung Hee Park, the new leader of South Korea.   Not 
only is Mr& Frelinghuysen a member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, but he is the grandson of the man who was instrumental 
in opening relations between the United States and Korea, Frederick 
T& Frelinghuysen, secretary of state in the administration of Chester 
A& Arthur. In addition Rep& Frelinghuysen's brother 
Harry was on the Korean desk of the State Department in World War 
/2,.   Next year is the 80th anniversary of the signing of 
the treaty between Korea and the United States and experts in Seoul 
are trying to find the correspondence between Frederick Frelinghuysen, 
who was secretary of state in 1883 and 1884, and Gen& Lucius 
Foote, who was the first minister to Korea.   They enlisted the 
help of the New Jersey congressman, who has been able to trace the 
letters to the national archives, where they are available on microfilm. 

#ON THE JOB#

A top official of the New Frontier who kept a 
record of his first weeks on the job here gives this report of his experiences:

In his first six weeks in office he presided over 
96 conferences, attended 35 official breakfasts and dinners, studied 
and signed 285 official papers and personally took 312 telephone calls.

In addition, he said, he has answered more than 400 messages 
of congratulations which led him to the comment that he himself had decided 
he wouldn't send another congratulatory message for the rest 
of his life. _@_ Sen& Case ~R-N&J&, has received a 
nice "thank you" note from a youngster he appointed to the Air Force 
Academy in Colorado.   Air Force life is great, the cadet 
wrote, "though the fourth-class system is no fun". He invited Mr& 
Case to stop by to say hello if he ever visited the academy and 
then added that he was on the managerial staff of the freshman football 
team   "We have just returned from Roswell, N&M&, where 
we were defeated, 34 to 9", the young man noted. "We have a 
tremendous amount of talent- but we lack cohesion". @ 

#KIND MR&

Among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn is 
one from Rep& Dwyer, ~R-6th Dist&. Mrs& Dwyer's husband, 
M& Joseph Dwyer, was taking a 10-year-old boy from Union County 
on the tour of the Capitol during the final weeks of the last session. 
They ran across Mr& Rayburn and the youngster expressed a 
desire to get the Speaker's autograph.   Mr& Dwyer said that 
although it was obvious that Mr& Rayburn was not well he stopped, 
gave the youngster his autograph, asked where he was from and expressed 
the hope that he would enjoy his visit to Congress.   Two 
days later Mr& Rayburn left Washington for the last time.

THE 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being 
celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament, 
the first part of the New English Bible, undertaken as a new 
translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English.   Since 
it was issued in the spring of 1611, the King James Version has 
been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations 
of the Bible. However, Biblical scholars frequently attested 
to its numerous inaccuracies, as old manuscripts were uncovered 
and scholarship advanced.   This resulted in revisions of the King 
James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 
1901 as the American Standard Version. Then in 1937 America's 
International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision, 
in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages. 
Undertaken by 32 American scholars, under the chairmanship 
of Rev& Dr& Luther A& Weigle, former dean of Yale University 
Divinity School, their studies resulted in the publishing of the 
Revised Standard Version, 1946-52. 

#NOT RIVAL#

The New English 
Bible (the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a 
future date) has not been planned to rival or replace the King James 
Version, but, as its cover states, it is offered "simply as the Bible 
to all those who will use it in reading, teaching, or worship".

Time, of course will testify whether the new version will have 
achieved its purpose. Bible reading, even more so than good classical 
music, grows in depth and meaning upon repetition.   If this 
new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout 
the years, it will not survive the ages as has the King James 
Version.   However, an initial perusal and comparison of some 
of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to 
speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars. One is 
impressed with the dignity, clarity and beauty of this new translation 
into contemporary English, and there is no doubt that the meaning of 
the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary 
language than in the frequently 
archaic words and phrases of the 
King James.   For example, in the third chapter of Matthew, verses 
13-16, describing the baptism of Jesus, the 1611 version reads:

"Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, 
to be baptized of him.   "But John forbad him, saying, I have 
need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?   "And 
Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it 
becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.

"And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway out of the 
water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit 
of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him". 

#CLEARER 
MEANING#

Certainly, the meaning is clearer to one who is not 
familiar with Biblical teachings, in the New English Bible which reads: 
"Then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee, and he came 
to John to be baptized by him. John tried to dissuade him. 'Do you 
come to me'? he said; 'I need rather to be baptized by you'. 
Jesus replied, 'let it be so for the present; we do well to 
conform this way with all that God requires'. John then allowed him 
to come. After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once, and 
at that moment heaven opened; he saw the Spirit of God descending 
like a dove to alight upon him";   (the paragraphing, spelling 
and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version.) 
Among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes 
and yet so few persons, other than scholars, really understand the 
true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning 
of the Sermon on the Mount.   To illustrate, the first blessing 
in the King James Bible reads: "Blessed are the poor in 
spirit; for their's is the kingdom of heaven". The new version 
states: "How blest are those who know that they are poor; the 
kingdom of Heaven is theirs".   Some of the poetic cadence of 
the older version certainly is lost in the newer one, but almost anyone, 
with a fair knowledge of the English language, can understand the 
meaning, without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar. 
To a novice 
that is significant.   In the second and third 
chapters of Revelation the new version retains, however, the old phrase 
"angel of the church" which Biblical scholars have previously 
interpreted as meaning bishop. This is not contemporary English. 

#MOSTLY 
CONTEMPORARY#

For the most part, however, the new version is 
contemporary and, as such, should be the means for many to attain a 
clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds 
of years ago by the first followers of Christ.   Originally 
recorded by hand, these words have been copied and recopied, translated 
and retranslated through the ages. Discoveries recently made of 
old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings, 
some by the early church fathers, in themselves called for a restudy 
of the Bible. To have the results recorded in everyday usable 
English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.   There 
is one danger, however. With contemporary English changing with the 
rapidity that marks this jet age, some of the words and phrases of the 
new version may themselves soon become archaic. The only answer will 
be continuous study.   The New Testament offered to the public 
today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up 
of representatives of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, 
Methodist Church, Congregational Union, Baptist Union, Presbyterian 
Church of England, Churches in Wales, Churches in Ireland, 
Society of Friends, British and Foreign Bible Society and National 
Society of Scotland.   Prof& C& H& Dodd, 76, a Congregational 
minister and a leading authority on the New Testament, 
is general director of the project and chairman of the New Testament 
panel.

Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but 
kind to the feet. That is why it is important to invest in comfortable, 
airy types of shoes.   There are many soft and light shoe 
leathers available. Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness 
achieved via unlined leathers. Softness is found in crushed 
textures.   Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with 
elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape. Heels place emphasis on 
the 
long legged silhouette. Wine glass heels are to be found in both high 
and semi-heights. Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored 
shoes. Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage 
pumps. 

#COOLEST SHADE#

While white is the coolest summer shade, 
there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend 
with any wardrobe color.   In the tintable group are high and 
little heels, squared and oval throats, and shantung-like textures.

Don't overlook the straws this year. They come in crisp basket 
weaves in natural honey hues, along with lacey open weaves with a 
lustre finish in natural, white, black and a whole range of colors. In 
the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in 
a variety of styles. For added comfort some of the Italian designed 
sandals have foam padded cushioning.   The citrus tones popular 
in clothing are also to be found afoot. Orange and lemon are considered 
important as are such pastels as blue and lilac. In a brighter nautical 
vein is Ille de France blue. Contrast trim provides other touches 
of color. Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel 
in smooth black, navy and taffy tan.
