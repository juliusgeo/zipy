the boards over the window, of course, but they're not painted and too 
rough to take prints. Same goes for the rough cement of the ledge. 
Besides, I doubt if the cops will even try dusting. They find dead 
winos every day, maybe they won't even autopsy him for the cause of 
death".   "We can't take a chance on that. We've got to 
assume they'll decide he was murdered and we've got to keep the 
picture consistent. Our hypothetical other bum who killed him would have 
turned out his pockets. Let's do that". We did that and found 
a dirty handkerchief, some matches and fourteen cents in change. We 
took the matches- they were book matches and once they'd been touched 
might retain fingerprints- and the change.   We discussed 
the candle and decided the hypothetical other bum would have left it 
burning to light his way to the window and because he'd have no reason 
to blow it out. The candle had been stuck on a tin lid so it wouldn't 
set fire to the crate when it guttered out. A fire wouldn't have 
mattered except that it would cause Pops to be found sooner. He 
might not be found for days, even weeks, otherwise.   We went once 
more over every point, then triple-checked. Being picked up for questioning 
by a cop on the way out seemed to be the only possible remaining 
danger, and we weren't picked up by a cop. In fact, nobody saw 
us, cop or citizen. Winsett is a quiet street with no taverns and was 
completely deserted at that hour. Which, if it matters, was one A&M&. 
Less than three hours ago we'd decided, in Maxine Wells's 
pad on Cosmo, to commit a trial murder. It had gone like clockwork. 
Almost <too> smoothly, I found myself thinking, and then told 
myself that was ridiculous. How safe is too safe? Thinking like that 
can get you into a padded pad.   An hour later we were back 
in my unpadded pad, killing what had been left of the second pint. We 
decided to leave the third one intact for tomorrow. Also our plans for 
me to commit Charlie's murder and for him to commit mine. But we 
were really going to do it. We shook hands on it.   We planned 
ahead only one step, a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap notes. 
I'd tell him everything I'd learned about Seaton's habits 
and habitat, and he'd tell me the score on Radic. We made the date 
for two o'clock in the afternoon at Maxine Wells's pad. Charlie 
would get there early because he had the key. From here on in, the 
less Charlie and I were seen together in public, or visited one another's 
rooms, the better.   I was dead tired and slept soundly, 
as far as I know dreamlessly.   We met at Maxine's and decided 
we were set to stay as long as it took, into or even through the 
evening, to talk things out. Charlie had brought food and we'd decided 
on no drinks. I'd brought along the virgin pint from last night, 
but we were going to kill that only when we were through talking.

I talked first, telling him everything I knew about Seaton and 
his house and domestic arrangements. I drew diagrams and floor plans; 
he memorized them thoroughly and then we tore them into tiny pieces 
and flushed them down. He gave me equivalent and even more detailed 
dope on Radic, including diagrams- one of the apartment building 
Radic lived in and one of the apartment itself. He'd been there several 
times, back when, while he and Radic had been friends, or at least 
not enemies.   It didn't take us as long as we'd thought 
it might; it was not quite six o'clock when we finished and Charlie 
said, "Well, I guess that's it. Shall we flip a coin to see 
which of us goes first? Or would you rather deal a hand of show-down 
poker or play a game of gin rummy, or what"?   "Wait a 
minute, Charlie", I said. "One thing we haven't discussed, expense 
money. We'll need <some> at least, if only bus fare to the 
scene of the crime. And if you're as flat broke as I am, I think 
we'll have to take the added risk of knocking over a filling station 
or something before we split for one of us to set up an alibi while 
the other does his dirty work".   He sighed. "All right, I'll 
come clean. I've got a little stashed for a rainy day, and I 
guess this is rainy enough. A couple of hundred. If you draw the short 
straw I'll lend you some bread, like fifty bucks, before I take 
off to visit my sister in Frisco. Then, after I'm back, another 
fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi 
somewhere while I take care of your seat cover boy".   "Solid", 
I said. I took a deep breath, and the plunge. "In that case, 
let's not draw. 
I'll go to bat first. You'd have to wait till Seaton's 
back from Mexico City and also while I set it up with Doris 
to have <her> have an alibi for D-night. So it wouldn't be 
for days or even a week before you could do anything. But your friend 
Manny can go any time".   He grinned and clapped me on the shoulder. 
"I was hoping you'd say that, Willy. But I wouldn't 
have suggested it. Well- in that case, I take off tomorrow morning 
for Frisco. And, in case, I brought the money with me".

Now that he knew himself to be self he was free to grok ever closer 
to his brothers, merge without let. Self's integrity was and 
is and ever had been. Mike stopped to cherish all his brother selves, 
the many threes-fulfilled on Mars, corporate and discorporate, the precious 
few on Earth- the unknown powers of three on Earth that would 
be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he 
grokked and cherished himself.   Mike remained in trance; there 
was much to grok, loose ends to puzzle over and fit into his growing- 
all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel Foster 
Tabernacle (not just cusp when he and Digby had come face to face alone) 
**h why Bishop Senator Boone made him warily uneasy, how Miss 
Dawn Ardent tasted like a water brother when she was not, the smell 
of goodness he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and 
wailing-   Jubal's conversations coming and going- Jubal's 
words troubled him most; he studied them, compared them with what 
he had been taught as a nestling, struggling to bridge between languages, 
the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in. 
The word "church" which turned up over and over again among Jubal's 
words gave him knotty difficulty; there was no Martian concept 
to match it- unless one took "church" and "worship" and 
"God" and "congregation" and many other words and equated them 
to the totality of the only world he had known during growing-waiting 
**h then forced the concept back into English in that phrase which 
had been rejected (by each differently) by Jubal, by Mahmoud, by Digby.

<"Thou art God">. He was closer to understanding 
it in English now, although it could never have the inevitability of 
the Martian concept it stood for. In his mind he spoke simultaneously 
the English sentence and the Martian word and felt closer grokking. 
Repeating it like a student telling himself that the jewel is in the 
lotus he sank into nirvana.   Before midnight he speeded his 
heart, resumed normal breathing, ran down his check list, uncurled and 
sat up. He had been weary; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed, 
ready for the many actions he saw spreading out before him.

He felt a puppyish need for company as strong as his earlier necessity 
for quiet. He stepped out into the hall, was delighted to encounter 
a water brother. <"Hi"!>   "Oh. Hello, Mike. 
My, 
you look chipper".   "I feel fine! Where is everybody"?

"Asleep. Ben and Stinky went home an hour ago and people 
started going to bed".   "Oh". Mike felt disappointed 
that Mahmoud had left; he wanted to explain his new grokking.

"I ought to be asleep, too, but I felt like a snack. Are you hungry"?

"Sure, I'm hungry"!   "Come on, there's 
some cold chicken and we'll see what else". They went downstairs, 
loaded a tray lavishly. "Let's take it outside. It's 
plenty warm".   "A fine idea", Mike agreed.   "Warm 
enough to swim- real Indian summer. I'll switch on the floods".

"Don't bother", Mike answered. "I'll carry the 
tray". He could see in almost total darkness. Jubal said that his 
night-sight probably came from the conditions in which he had grown 
up, and Mike grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to 
it; his foster parents had taught him to see. As for the night being 
warm, he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest but 
his water brothers had little tolerance for changes in temperature and 
pressure; he was considerate of their weakness, once he learned of 
it. But he was looking forward to snow- seeing for himself that each 
tiny crystal of the water of life was a unique individual, as he had 
read- walking barefoot, rolling in it.   In the meantime he was 
pleased with the warm night and the still more pleasing company of 
his water brother.   "Okay, take the tray. I'll switch on 
the underwater lights. That'll be plenty to eat by".   "Fine". 
Mike liked having light up through the ripples; it was a goodness, 
beauty. They picnicked by the pool, then lay back on the grass 
and looked at stars.   "Mike, there's Mars. It is Mars, 
isn't it? Or Antares"?   "It is Mars".   "Mike? 
What are they doing on Mars"?   He hesitated; 
the question was too wide for the sparse English language. "On the 
side toward the horizon- the southern hemisphere- it is spring; 
plants are being taught to grow".   "'Taught to grow'"?

He hesitated. "Larry teaches plants to grow. I have 
helped him. But my people- Martians, I mean; I now grok <you> 
are my people- teach plants another way. In the other hemisphere 
it is growing colder and nymphs, those who stayed alive through the 
summer, 
are being brought into nests for quickening and more growing". He 
thought. "Of the humans we left at the equator, one has discorporated 
and the others are sad".   Yes, I heard it in the news".

Mike had not heard it; he had not known it until asked. 
"They should not be sad. Mr& Booker T& W& Jones Food Technician 
First Class is not sad; the Old Ones have cherished him".

"You knew him"?   "Yes. He had his own face, 
dark and beautiful. But he was homesick".   "Oh, dear! 
Mike **h do you ever get homesick? For Mars"?   "At 
first I was homesick", he answered. "I was lonely always". He 
rolled toward her and took her in his arms. "But now I am not lonely. 
I grok I shall never be lonely again".   "Mike darling"- 
They kissed, and went on kissing.   Presently his water 
brother said breathlessly. "Oh, my! That was almost worse than 
the first time".   "You are all right, my brother"?

"Yes. Yes indeed. Kiss me again".   A long time later, 
by cosmic clock, she said, "Mike? Is that- I mean, 'Do 
you know'"-   "I know. It is for growing closer. Now we 
grow closer".   "Well **h I've been ready a long time- 
goodness, we <all> have, but **h never mind, dear; turn just a little. 
I'll help".   As they merged, grokking together, Mike 
said softly and triumphantly: "Thou art God".   Her answer 
was not in words. Then, as their grokking made them ever closer 
and Mike felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice called 
him back: "Oh! **h <Oh! Thou> art God"!   "We 
grok God". #/25,.#

On Mars humans were building pressure 
domes for the male and female party that would arrive by next ship. This 
went faster than scheduled as the Martians were helpful. Part of 
the time saved was spent on a preliminary estimate for a long-distance 
plan to free bound oxygen in the sands of Mars to make the planet more 
friendly to future human generations.   The Old Ones neither 
helped nor hindered this plan; time was not yet. Their meditations 
were approaching a violent cusp that would shape Martian art for 
many millennia. On Earth elections continued and a very advanced poet 
published a limited edition of verse consisting entirely of punctuation
