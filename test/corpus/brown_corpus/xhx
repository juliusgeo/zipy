had happened. If one dancer slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette, 
sit down, or offer his assailant a fork and spoon. Events occur 
without apparent reason. Their consequences are irrelevant- or there 
are no consequences at all.   The sequence is determined by 
chance, and Mr& Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance 
devices. He may toss coins; he may take slips of paper from a grab 
bag. The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal 
organization of the dance but also its spatial design, special 
slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be 
performed. The other variables include the dancer who is to perform 
the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance. 
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the 
movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and the approximate 
total duration of the dance. The "approximate" is important, because 
even after the order of the work has been established by the chance 
method, the result is not inviolable. Each performance may be different. 
If a work is divided into several large segments, a last-minute 
drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for 
any particular performance. And any sequence can not only change its 
positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.

Mr& Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method; he 
adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can. However, there is always 
the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible 
to execute. Then the choreographer must arbitrate. He must 
rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other. 
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone 
one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation 
for the leap.

THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH were in greater agreement on sovereignty, 
through all their dispute about it, than were the Founding Fathers. 
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen 
of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun, and defended in the end 
by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee. The people everywhere 
had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles, in 
understanding of and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their 
Union. Repeated efforts- beginning with the Missouri Compromise 
of 1821- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas 
to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise, rather than clear 
thought and timely action. Even so, confusion in this period gained 
such strength (from compromise and other factors) that it led to the 
bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century. Nothing can show more than 
this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in 
even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.

The present issue in Atlantica- whether to transform an 
alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens- 
resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that 
was resolved by Civil War. And so I would only touch upon it now 
(much as I have long wanted to write a book about it). I think it is 
essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts 
of sovereignty that went to war in 1861- if only to see better 
how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse 
confusion on this subject.   The difference came down to this: 
The Southern States insisted that the United States was, in last 
analysis, what its name implied- a Union of States. To their leaders 
the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign 
states, who therefore retained the right to secede from it. This right 
of the State, its upholders contended, was essential to maintain 
the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger 
of centralizing power in the Union government. The champions of 
the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, 
the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign 
citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right 
to secede, though the citizens could. Writing to Speed on August 
24, 1855, Lincoln made the latter point clear. In homely terms whose 
timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to secede. 
"  We began by declaring that <all men are created equal>. 
We now practically read it, <all men are created equal except negroes>. 
When the Know-nothings get control, it will read, <All 
men 
are created equal except negroes> and foreigners and Catholics. When 
it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where 
they make no pretence of loving liberty- to Russia, for instance, where 
despotism can be taken pure, without the base alloy of hypocrisy". 
[His emphasis]   When the Southern States exercised 
their "right to secede", they formed what they officially styled "The 
Confederate States of America". Dictionaries, as we have 
seen, still cite this government, along with the Articles of Confederation 
of 1781, as an example of a confederacy. The fact is that the 
Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as 
the Federal Constitution did. The Confederate Constitution copied 
much of the Federal Constitution verbatim, and most of the rest in 
substance. It operated on, by and for the people individually just as 
did the Federal Constitution. It made substantially the same division 
of power between the central and state governments, and among the 
executive, legislative and judicial branches. 

#THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
CONFEDERACY AND FEDERAL UNION IN 1861#

Many believe- and understandably- 
that the great difference between the Constitution of 
the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the 
former recognized the right of each state to secede. But though each 
of its members had asserted this right against the Union, the final 
Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11- nearly a month 
before hostilities began- included no explicit provision authorizing 
a state to secede. Its drafters discussed this vital point but 
left it out of their Constitution. Their President, Jefferson Davis, 
interpreted their Constitution to mean that it "admits of no coerced 
association", but this reremained so doubtful that "there were 
frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution".

The Constitution of the Southern "Confederation" 
differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects: 
It openly, defiantly, recognized slavery- an institution 
which the Southerners of 1787, even though they continued it, found so 
impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning 
the word in the Federal Constitution. They recognized that 
slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest, and that 
to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive 
contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in 
the Declaration of 1776 that "all men are created equal, that they 
are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among 
them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness **h". The 
other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the 
President of the Confederacy held office for six (instead of four) 
years, and was limited to one term.   These are not, however, differences 
in federal structure. The only important differences from that 
standpoint, between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles. 
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people 
were acting through their states, whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 
expressed, as clearly as language can, the opposite concept, that they 
were acting directly as citizens. Here are the two Preambles: _FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTION, 1789_ "we the People of the United States, 
in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure 
domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence, promote the general 
Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and 
our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United 
States of America". _CONFEDERATE CONSTITUTION, 1861_ "We 
the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its 
sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal 
government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure 
the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity- invoking 
the favor and the guidance of Almighty God- do ordain and establish 
this Constitution for the Confederate States of America".

One is tempted to say that, on the difference between the concepts 
of sovereignty in these two preambles, the worst war of the Nineteenth 
century was fought. But though the Southern States, when drafting 
a constitution to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this 
fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede, the fact remained 
that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept 
that it was composed primarily of sovereign states. If the Union 
conceded this to them, the same right must be conceded to each remaining 
state whenever it saw fit to secede: This would destroy the federal 
balance between it and the states, and in the end sacrifice to 
the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained 
by their Union.   Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the 
issue for the Union a vital one: Whether it was a Union of sovereign 
citizens that should continue to live, or an association of sovereign 
states that must fall prey either to "anarchy or despotism".

Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always willing to 
concede to each "slave state" the right to decide independently whether 
to continue or end it. Though his election was interpreted by 
many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal 
balance in favor of the Union, Lincoln himself proposed no such change 
in the rights the Constitution gave the states. After the war began, 
he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action 
even in the Border States that stayed with the Union. He issued 
his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left 
him no other way to save the Union. In his Message of December 
2, 1862, he put his purpose and his policy in these words- which I 
would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-Union: <"In giving 
freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free">.   What 
Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people 
were sovereign in the Union. He fought to the end to preserve it 
as a "government of the people, by the people, for the people". 

#THE 
TRUTH ON EACH SIDE WON IN THE CIVIL WAR#

The fact that the Americans 
who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to 
keep many of their people more securely in slavery- the antithesis 
of individual liberty- made the conflict grimmer, and the greater. 
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged, in the South as in the North, 
as America's true sovereign, in "a new birth of freedom", as 
Lincoln promised. But before this came about, 214,938 Americans had 
given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights 
of men and of states.   On their decisive battlefield Lincoln 
did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the "brave 
men, living and dead, who fought here". He understood that both 
sides were at fault, and he reached the height of saying so explicitly 
in his Second Inaugural.   To my knowledge, Lincoln remains 
the only Head of State and Commander-in-Chief who, while fighting 
a fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough to say this 
publicly- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human 
truth there is some error, and in all our error, some truth. So great 
a man could not but understand, too, that the thing that moves men to 
sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought, which their 
opponents see and attack, but the truth which the latter do not see- 
any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves 
defend.   It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day 
to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives 
in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had 
delegated to the States and to their Union. They differed in the
