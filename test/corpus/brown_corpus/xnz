of painting. It is curious that at its best, the work of this 
school of painting- Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Clyfford Still, 
Robert Motherwell, Willem de-Kooning, and the rest- resembles 
nothing so much as the passage painting of quite unimpressive painters: 
the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a Henry McFee, 
itself a formula derived from Renoir; the splashes of light and 
black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitators of Hals and Sargent. 
Often work of this sort is presented as calligraphy- the pure 
utterance of the brush stroke seeking only absolute painteresque values. 
You have only to compare such painting with the work of, say, 
Sesshu, to realize that someone is using words and brushes carelessly.

At its best the abstract expressionists achieve a simple rococo 
decorative surface. Its poverty shows up immediately when compared 
with Tiepolo, where the rococo rises to painting of extraordinary profundity 
and power. A Tiepolo painting, however confabulated, is a 
universe of tensions in vast depths. A Pollock is an object of art- 
bijouterie- disguised only by its great size. In fact, once the size 
is big enough to cover a whole wall, it turns into nothing more than 
extremely expensive wallpaper. Now there is nothing wrong with complicated 
wallpaper. There is just more to Tiepolo. The great Ashikaga 
brush painters painted wallpapers, too- at least portable ones, 
screens.   A process of elimination which leaves the artist with 
nothing but the play of his materials themselves cannot sustain interest 
in either artist or public for very long. So, in the last couple 
of years, abstract expressionism has tended toward romantic suggestion- 
indications of landscape or living figures.

ANGLO-SAXON and Greek epic each provide on two occasions 
a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic 
age. Hrothgar's court bard sings of the encounters at Finnsburg (lines 
1068-1159), and improvises the tale of Beowulf's exploits in 
a complimentary comparison of the Geatish visitor with Sigemund (lines 
871-892); Alcinou^s' court bard sings of the discovered adultery 
of Ares and Aphrodite (<Odyssey> /8,.266-366), and takes up 
a tale of Odysseus while the Ithacan wanderer listens on (<Odyssey> 
/8,.499-520). Nothing in all this is autobiographical: unlike 
the poets of <Deor> and <Widsith>, the poet of <Beowulf> is 
not concerned with his own identity; the poet of the <Odyssey>, 
reputed blind, reveals himself not at all in singing of the blind minstrel 
Demodocus. Since none of these glimpses of poetizing without writing 
is intended to incorporate a signature into the epic matter, there 
is prima-facie evidence that <Beowulf> and the Homeric poems each 
derive from an oral tradition. That such a tradition lies behind 
the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey>, at least, is hard to deny. Milman 
Parry rigorously defended the observation that the extant Homeric 
poems are largely formulaic, and was led to postulate that they could 
be shown entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of Greek epic survived; 
he further reasoned that frequent formulas in epic verse indicate 
oral composition, and assumed the slightly less likely corollary 
that oral epic is inclined towards the use of formulas. Proceeding from 
Parry's conclusions and adopting one of his schemata, Francis P& 
Magoun, Jr&, argues that <Beowulf> likewise was created from 
a legacy of oral formulas inherited and extended by bards of successive 
generations, and the thesis is striking and compelling. Yet a fresh 
inspection will indicate one crucial amendment: <Beowulf> and 
the Homeric poems are not at all formulaic to the same extent.

The bondage endurable by an oral poet is to be estimated only by a 
very skilful oral poet, but it appears safe to assume that no sustained 
narrative in rhyme could be composed without extreme difficulty, even 
in a language of many terminal inflections. Assonance seems nearly 
as severe a curb, although in a celebrated passage William of Malmesbury 
declares that a <Song of Roland> was intoned before the battle 
commenced at Hastings. The Anglo-Saxon alliterative line and the 
Homeric hexameter probably imposed less of a restraint; the verse 
of <Beowulf> or of the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> was not easy 
to create but was not impossible for poets who had developed their talents 
perforce in earning a livelihood. Yet certain aids were valuable 
and quite credibly necessary for reciting long stretches of verse without 
a pause. The poet in a written tradition who generally never blots 
a line may once in a while pause and polish without incurring blame. 
But the oral poet cannot pause; he must improvise continuously 
with no apparent effort. Even though the bondage of his verse is not 
so great as the writing poet can manage, it is still great enough for 
him often to be seriously impeded unless he has aids to facilitate rapid 
composition. The Germanic poet had such aids in the kennings, which 
provided for the difficulties of alliteration; the Homeric poet 
had epithets, which provided for recurring needs in the hexameter. Either 
poet could quickly and easily select words or phrases to supply 
his immediate requirements as he chanted out his lines, because the kennings 
and the epithets made possible the construction of systems of numerous 
synonyms for the chief common and proper nouns. Other synonyms 
could of course serve the same function, and for the sake of ease I 
shall speak of kennings and epithets in the widest and loosest poss1ble 
sense, and name, for example, <Gar-Dene> a kenning for the Danes. 
Verbal and adverbial elements too participated in each epic diction, 
but it is for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and 
adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents, and to designate the 
members of any system of equivalents as basic formulas of the poetic 
language. Limited to a few thousand lines of heroic verse in Anglo-Saxon 
as in the other Germanic dialects, we cannot say how frequently 
the kennings in <Beowulf> recurred in contemporary epic on the same 
soil. But we can say that since a writing poet, with leisure before 
him, would seem unlikely to invent a technique based upon frequent and 
substantial circumlocution, the kennings like the epithets must reasonably 
be ascribed to an oral tradition.   One of the greatest 
Homerists of our time, Frederick M& Combellack, argues that when 
it is assumed the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> are oral poems, the 
postulated single redactor called Homer cannot be either credited with 
or denied originality in choice of phrasing. Any example of grand 
or exquisite diction may have been created by the poet who compiled numerous 
lays into the two works we possess or may be due to one of his 
completely 
unknown fellow-craftsmen. The quest of the historical Homer 
is likely never to have further success; no individual word in the 
<Iliad> or the <Odyssey> can be credited to any one man; no strikingly 
effective element of speech in the extant poems can with assurance 
be said not to have been a commonplace in the vaster epic corpus 
that may have existed at the beginning of the first millennium before 
Christ. This observation is of interest not only to students of Homeric 
poetry but to students of Anglo-Saxon poetry as well. To the 
extent that a tale is twice told, its final author must be suspect, although 
plagiarism in an oral tradition is less a misdemeanor than the 
standard <modus dicendi>.   Combellack argues further, and here 
he makes his main point, that once the <Iliad> and the <Odyssey> 
are thought formulaic poems composed for an audience accustomed to 
formulaic poetry, Homeric critics are deprived of an entire domain they 
previously found arable. With a few important and a few more unimportant 
exceptions, no expression can be deemed <le mot juste> for its 
context, because each was very probably the only expression that long-established 
practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow. Words 
or phrases that connoisseurs have admired as handsome or ironic or 
humorous must therefore lose merit and become regarded as mere inevitable 
time-servers, sometimes accurate and sometimes not. This observation 
too may have reference to Anglo-Saxon poetry. To the extent that 
a language is formulaic, its individual components must be regarded 
as no more distinguished than other cliches.   W& F& Bryan 
suggests that certain kennings in <Beowulf> were selected sometimes 
for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness, but 
such a view would appear untenable unless it is denied that the language 
of <Beowulf> is formulaic. If the master of scops who was most 
responsible for the poem ever used kennings that were traditional, he 
was at least partly deprived of free will and not inclined towards shrewd 
and sophisticated misuse of speech elements. Once many significant 
phrases are found in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for 
prosodic necessity, they are not to be defended for their semantic properties 
in isolated contexts. It is false to be certain of having discovered 
in the language of <Beowulf> such effects as intentional irony.

Yet, if the argument is turned awry, there may be found a 
great deal in Bryan's view, after all. A formulaic element need not 
be held meaningless merely because it was selected with little conscious 
reflection. Time-servers though the periphrastic expressions are, 
they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous. A long evolution 
in an oral tradition caused the poetic language of the heroic 
age to be based upon formulas that show the important qualities of things, 
and these formulas are therefore potentially rather than always actually 
accurate. True, we do not know how they were regarded in their 
day, but we need not believe the epic audience to have been more insensitive 
to the formulas than the numerous scholars of modern times who 
have read Germanic or Homeric poetry all their lives and still found 
much to admire in occasional occurrences of the most familiar phrases. 
Nouns and adjectives in a written tradition are chosen for the nonce; 
in an oral tradition they may be chosen for the entire epic corpus, 
and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation. 
Reliance is therefore not to be placed upon the archaeological particulars 
in an oral poem; no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable 
ruins of Heorot or the palace of Priam. A ship at dry-dock 
could be called a foamy-necked floater in Anglo-Saxon or a swift 
ship in Greek. Even when defenseless of weapons the Danes would be 
<Gar-Dene> (as their king is Hrothgar) and Priam would be |e|u|m|m|e|l|i|h|s. 
Achilles, like Siegfried in the <Nibelungenlied>, 
is potentially the swiftest of men and may accordingly 
be called swift-footed even when he stands idle. In <Coriolanus> 
the agnomen of Marcius is used deliberately and pointedly, but the 
Homeric epithets and the Anglo-Saxon kennings are used casually and 
recall to the hearer "a familiar story or situation or a useful or 
pleasant quality of the referent". The epic language was not entirely 
the servant of the poet; it was partly his master. The poet's 
intentions are difficult to discern and, except to biographers, unimportant; 
the language, however, is a proper object of scrutiny, and the 
effects of the language are palpable even if sometimes inevitable.

<Beowulf> and the Homeric poems appear oral compositions. Yet 
they are written; at some stage in their evolution they were transcribed. 
Albert B& Lord suggests that the Homeric poems were dictated 
to a scribe by a minstrel who held in his mind the poems fully matured 
but did not himself possess the knowledge of writing since it 
would 
be useless to his guild, and Magoun argues that the <Beowulf> 
poet and Cynewulf may have dictated their verse in the same fashion. 
This explanation is attractive, but is vitiated at least in part by 
the observation that Cynewulf, though he used kennings in the traditional 
manner, was a literate man who four times inscribed his name by runes 
into his works. If Cynewulf was literate, the <Beowulf> poet 
may have been also, and so may the final redactor of the <Iliad> and 
the <Odyssey>. In lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate 
bard, one may conceive of a man who heard a vast store of oral poetry 
recited, and became intimately familiar with the established aids 
to poetizing, and himself wrote his own compositions or his edition of 
the compositions of the past. Other theories of origin are compatible 
with the formulaic theory: <Beowulf> may contain a design for 
terror, and the <Iliad> may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answering 
to a ceramic pattern produced during the Geometric Period in 
pottery. The account of the growth and final transcription of these 
epics rests partly, however, upon the degree to which they were formulaic.

Carl Eduard Schmidt counted 1804 different lines repeated 
exactly in the two Homeric poems, and by increasing this figure so
