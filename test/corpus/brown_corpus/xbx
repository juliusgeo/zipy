that began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation by the 
legislature of county library systems financed by county governments 
with matching funds from the state. It was a step in the right direction, 
but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully 
the thriving systems of today.   Under this law annual grants are 
given to systems in substantial amounts. An earlier difficulty was 
overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might 
join or not, as they saw fit. Some library boards are wary of the 
plan. A large, well-stocked library, surrounded in a county by smaller 
ones, may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too 
great.  A small library may cherish its independence and established 
ways, and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems 
radical to older members of the board.   Within a system, however, 
the autonomy of each member library is preserved. The local community 
maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library 
program, facilities, and services, but wider resources and additional 
services become available through membership in a system. All 
services are given without cost to members. So obvious are these advantages 
that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State 
now has access to a system, and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day, 
not too distant, when all the libraries in the state will belong to 
a co-op. ##

TO SET up a co-operative library system, the law 
requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as 
the nucleus, and the system is organized around it. The collection may 
be in an existing library, or it may be built up in a central collection. 
Each system develops differently, according to the area it serves, 
but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for 
maximum efficiency. The basic state grant is thirty cents for each 
person served, and there is a further book incentive grant that provides 
an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if a library spends 
a certain number of dollars.   In Nassau County, for example, 
the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City, the 
system is credited by the state with serving one million persons, a figure 
that has doubled since 1950. This system, by virtue of its variety 
and size, offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation.

The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference 
service, what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge, 
and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area. The 
need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual 
libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday needs, could afford. Nassau 
is currently building a central collection of reference materials 
in its Hempstead headquarters, which will reach its goal of 100,000 
volumes by 1965.   The major part of this collection is in the 
central headquarters building, and the remainder is divided among five 
libraries in the system designated as subject centers. Basic 
reference 
tools are the backbone of the collection, but there is also specialization 
in science and technology, an indicated weakness in local libraries. 
On microfilm, headquarters also has a file of the <New York 
Times> from its founding in 1851 to the present day, as well as bound 
volumes of important periodicals. The entire headquarters collection 
is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.

Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day. It is connected 
by teletype with the State Library in Albany, which will supply any 
book to a system that the system itself cannot provide. The books are 
carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other 
libraries.   Each subject center library was chosen because 
of its demonstrated strength in a particular area, which headquarters 
could then build upon. East Meadow has philosophy, psychology, and 
religion; Freeport houses social science, pure science, and language; 
history, biography, and education are centered in Hempstead; Levittown 
has applied science, business, and literature; while Hewlett-Woodmere 
is the repository of art, music, and foreign languages. 
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant, 
and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen 
local reference service.   This kind of cooperation is not 
wholly new, of course. Public libraries in Nassau County have been 
lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century, but the system 
enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive 
basis. Local libraries find, too, that the new plan saves 
tax dollars because books can be bought through the system, and since 
the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would 
be available to an individual library. The system passes on these 
savings to its members. Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping 
and clerical detail as the result of central billing.

Books are not the only resource of the system. Schools and community 
groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary, art, 
and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs, 
and to organizations in member communities. The most recent film 
catalogue, available at each library, lists 110 titles presently in the 
collection, any of which may be borrowed without charge. This catalogue 
lists separately films suitable for children, young adults, or adults, 
although some classics cut across age groups, such as "Nanook 
of the North", "The Emperor's Nightingale", and "The 
Red Balloon". Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual 
consultant for the staffs of member libraries, teaching them the effective 
use of film as a library service.   The system well understands 
that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children 
and books together; consequently an experienced children's librarian 
at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned 
library activities, cooperating with the children's librarians 
in member libraries by means of individual conferences, workshops, 
and frequent visits. Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile 
book-review and book-selection center, to provide better methods of 
purchasing and selection. Sample copies of new books are on display 
at headquarters, where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in 
workshop groups. Story hours, pre-school programs, activities with 
community agencies, and lists of recommended reading are all in the province 
of the children's consultant.   Headquarters of the Nassau 
system is an increasingly busy place these days, threatening to expand 
beyond its boundaries. In addition to the interlibrary loan service 
and the children's program, headquarters has a public relations 
director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library 
service in the county; it prepares cooperative displays (posters, 
booklists, brochures, and other promotional material) for use in member 
libraries; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays 
already created and used; and it publishes <Sum and Substance>, 
a monthly newsletter, which reports the system's activities to 
the staffs and trustees of member libraries. The system itself is governed 
by a board of trustees, geographically representing its membership.

In Nassau, as in other systems, the long-range objective 
is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools, and 
on adult education in general. Librarians, a patient breed of men 
and women who have borne much with dedication, can begin to see results 
today. Library use is multiplying daily, and the bulk of the newcomers 
are those maligned Americans, the teen-agers. To them especially 
the librarians, with the help of co-ops, hope they will never have to 
say, "I'm sorry, we don't have that book".

TODAY, more than ever before, the survival of our free society 
depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned. The 
great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our 
own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western 
world. The need for lifetime reading is apparent. Education must not 
be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our 
entire lives, for it is only through knowledge that we, as a nation, 
can cope with the dangers that threaten our society.   The desire 
and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life. We 
cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read; if we are not 
discriminating in our reading; if we do not know how to use what we 
do read. We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific 
age, as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint 
that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom 
absorbed from the written word.   A fundamental source of knowledge 
in the world today is the book found in our libraries. Although 
progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still 
falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that 
are needed for an informed America. The problem grows in intensity 
each year as man's knowledge, and his capacity to translate such knowledge 
to the written word, continue to expand. The inadequacy of our 
library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct 
this condition. There are, for example, approximately 25,000,000 
people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 
with inadequate service. In college libraries, 57 per cent of the 
total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed 
last year by the U&S& Office of Education. And over 66 per 
cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any 
library at all. ##

IN every aspect of service- to the public, 
to children in schools, to colleges and universities- the library 
of today is failing to render vitally needed services. Only public 
understanding and support can provide that service.   This is 
one of the main reasons for National Library Week, April 16-22, and 
for its theme: "For a richer, fuller life, read"! 

#ASSEMBLY SESSION BROUGHT MUCH GOOD#

The General Assembly, which 
adjourns today, has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle 
from the day it convened. It was faced immediately with a showdown 
on the schools, an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the 
governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.

There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight, in 
which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers. The 
final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening 
budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information 
they need.   Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance 
them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid 
crisis-to-crisis government. This session, for instance, may have 
insured 
a financial crisis two years from now.   In all the turmoil, 
some good legislation was passed. Some other good bills were lost 
in the shuffle and await future action. Certainly all can applaud passage 
of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase in teacher 
pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance by the state of responsibility 
for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate 
as outside city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and the 
road maintenance bond issue.   No action has been taken, however, 
on such major problems as ending the fee system, penal reform, modification 
of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks 
sales. Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal 
question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.

The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations 
questions. Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate 
of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like 
anything but "the empire state of the South".   We congratulate 
the entire membership on its record of good legislation. In the 
interim between now and next year, we trust the House and Senate will 
put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic, fiscal 
and social problems and come up with answers without all the political 
heroics. @
