within man, there have always been the outer social functions for the 
community and society. The two have never been separable. Religion 
is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation.

The value-system of a community or society is always correlated with, 
and to a degree dependent upon, a more or less shared system of religious 
beliefs and convictions. The religion supports, re-enforces, 
reaffirms, and maintains the fundamental values. Even in the united 
states, with its freedom of religious belief and worship and its vast 
denominational differentiation, there is a general consensus regarding 
the basic Christian values. This is demonstrated especially when there 
is awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere; 
for example Americans rally to Christian values vis-a-vis those 
of atheistic communism. In America also all of our major religious bodies 
officially sanction a universalistic ethic which is reflective of 
our common religion. Even the non-church members- the freewheelers, 
marginal religionists and so on- have the values of Christian civilization 
internalized in them. Furthermore, religion tends to integrate 
the whole range of values from the highest or ultimate values of God 
to the intermediary and subordinate values; for example, those regarding 
material objects and pragmatic ends. Finally, it gives sanctity, 
more than human legitimacy, and even, through super-empirical reference, 
transcendent and supernatural importance to some values; for example, 
marriage as a sacrament, much law-breaking as sinful, occasionally 
the state as a divine instrument. It places certain values at least 
beyond questioning and tampering.   Closely related to this 
function is the fact that the religious system provides a body of ultimate 
ends for the society, which are compatible with the supreme eternal 
ends. This something leads to a conception of an over-all Social 
Plan with a meaning interpretable in terms of ultimate ends; for example, 
a plan that fulfills the will of God, which advances the Kingdom 
of God, which involves social life as part of the Grand Design. 
This explains some group ends and provides a justification of their 
primacy. It gives social guidance and direction and makes for programs 
of social action. Finally, it gives meaning to much social endeavor, 
and logic, consistency, and meaning to life. In general, there is no 
society so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired 
transcendental ends.   Religion integrates and unifies. Some 
of the oldest, most persistent, and most cohesive forms of social groupings 
have grown out of religion. These groups have varied widely from 
mere families, primitive, totemic groups, and small modern cults and 
sects, to the memberships of great denominations, and great, widely 
dispersed world religions. Religion fosters group life in various ways. 
The common ultimate values, ends and goals fostered by religion are 
a most important factor. Without a system of values there can be no 
society. Where such a value system prevails, it always unifies all 
who possess it; it enables members of the society to operate as a system. 
The beliefs of a religion also reflecting the values are expressed 
in creeds, dogmas, and doctrines, and form what Durkheim calls a credo. 
As he points out, a religious group cannot exist without a collective 
credo, and the more extensive the credo, the more unified and strong 
is the group. The credo unifies and socializes men by attaching 
them completely to an identical body of doctrine; the more extensive 
and firm the body of doctrine, the firmer the group.   The religious 
symbolism, and especially the closely related rites and worship 
forms, constitute a powerful bond for the members of the particular faith. 
The religion, in fact, is an expression of the unity of the group, 
small or large. The common codes, for religious action as such and 
in their ethical aspects for everyday moral behavior, bind the devotees 
together. These are ways of jointly participating in significantly 
symbolized, standardized, and ordered religiously sanctified behavior. 
The codes are mechanism for training in, and directing and enforcing, 
uniform social interaction, and for continually and publicly reasserting 
the solidarity of the group.   Durkheim noted long ago that 
religion as "**h a unified system of beliefs and practices relative 
to sacred things **h unite[s] into one single moral community **h 
all 
those who adhere to them". His view is that every religion pertains 
to 
a community, and, conversely, every community is in one aspect a religious 
unit. This is brought out in the common religious ethos that prevails 
even in the denominationally diverse audiences at many secular 
semi-public and public occasions in the United States; and it is 
evidenced in the prayers offered, in the frequent religious allusions, 
and in the confirmation of points on religious grounds.   The 
unifying effect of religion is also brought out in the fact that historically 
peoples have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural 
units, with religion as the dominant bond, even though spatially dispersed 
and not politically organized. The Jews for 2500 years have been 
a prime example, though the adherents of any world or interpeople religion 
are cases in point. it might be pointed out that the integrating 
function of religion, for good or ill, has often supported or been 
identified with other groupings- political, nationality, language, class, 
racial, sociability, even economic.   Religion usually exercises 
a stabilizing-conserving function. As such it acts as an anchor 
for the people. There is a marked tendency for religions, once firmly 
established, to resist change, not only in their own doctrines and policies 
and practices, but also in secular affairs having religious relevance. 
It has thus been a significant factor in the conservation of 
social values, though also in some measure, an obstacle to the creation 
or diffusion of new ones. It tends to support the longstanding precious 
sentiments, the traditional ways of thinking, and the customary ways 
of living. As Yinger has pointed out, the "**h reliance on symbols, 
on tradition, on sacred writings, on the cultivation of emotional 
feelings of identity and harmony with sacred values, turns one to the 
past far more than to the future". Historically, religion has also 
functioned as a tremendous engine of vindication, enforcement, sanction, 
and perpetuation of various other institutions.   At the same 
time that religion exercises a conserving influence, it also energizes 
and motivates both individuals and groups. Much of the important 
individual and social action has been owing to religious incentives. The 
great ultimate ends of religion have served as magnificent beacon 
lights that lured people toward them with an almost irresistible force, 
mobilizing energies and inducing sacrifices; for example, the Crusades, 
mission efforts, just wars. Much effort has been expended in the 
sincere effort to apply the teaching and admonitions of religion. The 
insuperable reward systems that most religions embody have great motivating 
effects. Religion provides the most attractive rewards, either 
in this world or the next, for those who not merely abide by its norms, 
but who engage in good works.   Religion usually acts as a 
powerful 
aid in social control, enforcing what men should or should not 
do. Among primitive peoples the sanctions and dictates of religion were 
more binding than any of the other controls exercised by the group; 
and in modern societies such influence is still great. Religion has 
its own supernatural prescriptions that are at the same time codes 
of behavior for the here and now. 
Overwhelmed with the care of five young children and concerned about 
persistent economic difficulties due to her husband's marginal income, 
her defense of denial was excessively strong. Thus the lack of effective 
recognition of the responsibilities involved in caring for two 
babies showed signs of becoming a disabling problem. The result, dramatically 
visible in a matter of days in the family's disrupted daily 
functioning, was a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall 
the second twin, whose birth had not been anticipated. Soon Mrs& 
B&'s fears threatened to burst into a full-blown panic concerning 
the welfare of the entire family. Inability to care for the other 
children, difficulty in feeding the babies, who seemed colicky, bone-weary 
fatigue, repeated crying episodes, and short tempers reflected 
the family's helplessness in coping with the stressful situation. Clearly, 
this was a family in crisis.   Mrs& B& compared her 
feelings of weakness to her feelings of weakness and helplessness at 
the time of her mother's death when she was eight, as well as her subsequent 
anger at her father for remarrying. Her previous traumatic experiences 
flashed through her mind as if they had happened yesterday. 
On the anniversary of her father's death she poured out with agonized 
tears her feelings of guilt about not having attended his funeral. 
In the family's own words (during the third of twelve visits), they 
had "reached the crisis peak- either the situation will give or 
we 
will break"!   Direct confrontation and acceptance of Mrs& 
B&'s anger against the second baby soon dissipated her fears 
of annihilation. Abreaction of her anxiety and guilt concerning the 
death of her parents, when linked up with her current feelings of anger 
and her fears of loss, abandonment, and annihilation, produced further 
relief of tension. In a joint interview Mr& and Mrs& B& were 
helped to understand the meaning of a younger son's wandering away 
from home in terms of his feelings of displacement in reaction to the 
arrival of the twins. The father, accurately perceiving the child's 
needs, not only respected them as worthy of his attention, but immediately 
satisfied them by taking him on his lap along with the twins, 
saying, "I have a big lap; there is room for you, too, Johnnie". 
Simultaneously, a variety of environmental supports- a calm but 
not 
too motherly homemaker, referral for temporary economic aid, intelligent 
use of nursing care, accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical 
advice on the twins' feeding problem- combined to prevent further 
development of predictable pathological mechanisms. Follow-up visits 
of the nurse and social worker indicated continued success in the 
care of the new babies as well as a marked improvement in the family's 
day-to-day mental health and social functioning.   As seen 
in the B& family, there must be an attempt to help the client develop 
conscious awareness of the problem, especially in the absence of a 
formal request for assistance. The lack of awareness usually springs 
from deep but disguised anxiety, often assuming the superficial guise 
of "not knowing" or "not caring". The unhealthy use of denial 
in the initial reaction to a stress must be handled through the medium 
of a positive controlled transference. In general, the approach is 
more active than passive, more out-reaching than reflective. While some 
regression is inevitable, it is discouraged rather than encouraged 
so that the transference does not follow the stages of planned regression 
associated with certain casework adaptations of the psychoanalytic 
model for insight therapy.   To establish an emotionally meaningful 
relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness 
immediately, preferably within the first interview, by meeting 
the client's specific needs. These needs usually concern the reduction 
of guilt and some relief of tension. The initial interview must 
be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking 
sense. In this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate 
confidence in the client's ability to deal with the problem. In 
so doing he implicitly offers the positive contagion of hope as a kind 
of maturational dynamic to counteract feelings of helplessness and hopelessness 
generally associated with the first stages of stress impact. 
Thus, the client receives enough ego support to engage in constructive 
efforts on his own behalf. Here there is a specific preventive component 
which applies in a more generalized sense to any casework situation. 
We are preventing or averting pathogenic phenomena such as undue 
regression, unhealthy suppression and repression, excessive use of 
denial, and crippling guilt turned against the self. While some suppression 
and some denial are not only necessary but healthy, the worker's 
clinical knowledge must determine how these defenses are being used, 
what healthy shifts in defensive adaptation are indicated, and when 
efforts at bringing about change can be most effectively timed.

In steering the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive 
responses, the worker uses time-honored focused casework techniques 
of specific emotional support, clarification, and anticipatory guidance. 
Over a relatively short period of time, usually about four to twelve 
weeks, the worker must be able to shift the focus, back and forth, 
between immediate external stressful exigencies ("precipitating stress")
