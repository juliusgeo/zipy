by addition symbols may be placed in any order.   When solving 
an equation that involves division as well as other steps, do all 
the division steps first 
to reduce those parts of the equation to their 
numerical value. Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can then 
be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left 
end of the equation and working toward the right. Completing the 
division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication, 
subtraction, or addition steps: **f This would be reduced 
by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12. This part 
of the equation would then become 4.   For use in formulas, fractions 
should be converted to their decimal equivalents. The easiest 
way to do this is with a conversion chart. Charts for this purpose 
are available from many sources. They are included in all types of mathematical 
handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision 
measuring instruments.   The various mathematical processes can 
be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places. 
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental 
effect on the accuracy of the final result.   Some formulas 
contain "constants". A constant is a number that remains the same 
regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant 
equation. It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved 
correctly.   Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport. 
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases 
and, 
quite often, are necessary for completing entry blanks for different 
events. When it is needed, one formula is as important as another. 
However, some formulas are used more than others. We'll take 
them in the general order of their popularity. 

#ENGINE DISPLACEMENT# 

A rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine. 
Displacement is sometimes referred to as "swept volume". Most 
entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information 
because of class restrictions. It is good to be able to compute 
displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking 
can be computed.   Factors involved in the displacement formula 
are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length of the 
piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the engine, and a constant. 
The constant is .7854, which is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant 
known as "pi". Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions 
of circles.   Actually, the engine displacement formula is 
the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type 
with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the 
engine. The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and 
then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying 
the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent of the length 
of the cylinders. Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders 
in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.   The formula 
is: **f. Dimensions in inches, and fractions of inches will give 
the displacement in cubic inches. Dimensions in centimeters and fractions 
of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters 
(~cc). One inch equals 2.54 centimeters: one cubic inch equals 16.38 
cubic centimeters.   For example, let's consider a standard 
283 cubic inch Chevy ~V8. These engines have a cylinder diameter 
of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches. The formula, with 
the fractions converted to decimals, becomes **f.   To arrive 
at the answer, multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of 
the group and working to the right. The different steps will look like 
this: **f 

#COMPRESSION RATIO#

A cylinder's compression ratio 
is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume, or its displacement, 
with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber. 
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber 
volume must be measured with a liquid.   Cylinder volume is 
determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula: 
**f.   To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers 
in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark plug in the chamber 
and support the head so that its gasket surface is level. Then pour 
water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill 
the chamber to its gasket surface. Do not overfill the chamber. This 
is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension. 
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface 
around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.

The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting 
the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from 
the original quantity. Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters 
(~cc), making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches. 
However, the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic 
centimeters. The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will 
be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are 
used. The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be 
quoted in the same terms.   The volume of the cylinder opening 
in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square 
inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch. Sometimes 
it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening 
but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy 
that it won't affect the final computation. The volume of the opening 
is added to the combustion chamber volume.   Another thing 
that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between 
the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston 
is in top dead center position. Compute this volume by measuring 
the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately 
as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring 
device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth. The 
formula for this step is: **f This volume is added to the total volume 
of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening. The total of 
these three volumes is the "final combustion chamber volume".

After the factors just described have been computed, they are applied 
to the following formula: **f   For an example let's dream 
up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic 
inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches. Applying these figures 
to the formula we get the equation: **f The compression ratio is 
10 to 1.   This method of computing compression ratio cannot be 
used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly 
shaped heads. Any irregularity on the piston heads will make 
it impossible, with normal means, to determine the final combustion 
chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot 
be readily computed. The only way to determine the final combustion 
chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid 
while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston 
is in top dead center position. 

#GEAR RATIO- SPEED RELATIONSHIPS# 

There are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships 
of car speed, engine speed, rear axle gear ratio, and rear tire 
size. By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can 
be determined for any combination of the other three.   To simplify 
the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of 
the factors. These are   ~MPH for Car speed   ~RPM 
for Engine crankshaft speed   ~R for Rear axle gear ratio

~W for Tire size   Tire size can be determined in 
several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is 
by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly. This 
is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire 
is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft. A tire must be inflated 
to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to 
its operating weight when this measurement is made. The measurement 
must be in inches. Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement 
must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics. 
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used 
in the formula.   To determine car speed for a given combination 
of engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula is: **f 
For an engine speed of 5000 ~rpm, a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1, and a 
tire radius of 13 inches, the equation would look like this: **f

To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three 
factors the formula is: **f Using the same figures as for the 
previous example, the equation becomes: **f   To determine the 
rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors, the 
formula is: **f Using the figures from the previous examples, the 
equation becomes: **f 

#ORLANDO, FLA&, FEB& 2#- The best 2-year-old pacing mile up 
to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner (Mainliner-Highland 
Ellen), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was 
clocked 2:25. She is owned by Ralph H& Kroening, Milwaukee, 
Wis&, who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly proud of her.

Other good miles have been by Debonnie (Dale Frost-Debby 
Hanover) and Prompt Time (Adios-On Time) in 2:28-:36; 
Kimberly Gal (Galophone-Kimberly Hanover) 2:26.2; Laguerre 
Hanover 
(Tar Heel- Lotus Hanover) and Monel (Tar Heel-Miracle Byrd) 
in 2:34~h. Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation- 
good body, plenty of heart girth, stands straight on his legs 
on excellent feet- and has the smoothest gait. This colt is behind 
most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show 
about as much pace as any of them. Monel shows improvement with each 
work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her 
share of races.   Stardel (Star's Pride-Starlette Hanover), 
2:34~h, looks quite promising. Fury Hanover (Hoot Mon-Fay), 
Caper (Hoot Mon-Columbia Hanover) and Isaac (Hoot Mon-Goddess 
Hanover) have been working together but have not equalled their best 
work done some weeks ago. Fury and Caper worked in 2:35~h and did 
it with ease. They are two good colts of different type. Fury is 
upstanding and on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type. 
I have never seen Caper off his feet- he seems to know nothing but 
'trot' and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so. Fury 
has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect, with his 
impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.

Trackdown (Torrid-Mighty Lady) has worked a mile in 2:33.3~h. 
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace. Then, after 
emasculation, he was eased up for a couple of weeks. He has thrived 
on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race 
horse.   Thor Hanover (Adios-Trustful Hanover) is a wonderful 
looking prospect and another good individual, with solid, rugged conformation, 
good, flat bone and excellent feet. This colt arrived at 
the Raceway early last November, and immediately was put into harness 
and line-driven for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in 
very nicely, knowing nothing but trot. He appeared in the hopples about 
November 14, was treated for worms on the 18th, the latter date being 
the first time he struck a real pace. On December 5 he paced a mile 
in 2:55 on the twice-around, out in third position all the way. 
This colt has done everything asked of him, and done it with ease. His 
best mile to date is 2:32.2~h.   Gamecock (Tar Heel-Terka 
Hanover) is another promising colt, and his best time is 2:32.2~h. 
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center. 
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare; 
the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff. The fourth time in 
harness he walked off like a gentleman. Being blistered for curbs has
