hardly seemed to help. If the situation had been bad, it now got 
worse. About this time people began "dropping in", considering 
that the newly married had been left alone long enough. Angrily Martin 
wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip- preferably 
one that lasted months- instead of deciding not to postpone the date 
until he could get away. Here they were at the mercy of anyone who 
chose to come by. These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores 
showing them around the apartment. Of course, the tours of inspection 
included the ever-present shorts.   It was curious how the 
different visitors took this. Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's 
countenance. Others asked. Quite a few laughed. To them 
all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale.   "It's a little 
contest Martin and I have", she would begin gaily, carrying 
the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course. While he waited 
in the living room.   Once Martin went along. They entered the 
bedroom, and Dolores said nothing. Then one of the guests showed his 
merriment. "You were in a hurry, weren't you"? Martin would 
have liked to break the man's neck. Dolores smiled; she let the 
interpretation stand. Now Martin heard himself give a snort of mock 
good nature. With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth, ready to 
begin: <It's a little contest>-   Never again did he 
enter into the ritual of showing the apartment.   They kept up a 
rigid pretense of speaking relations. But Martin seldom felt the impulse 
to talk about anything. What to talk about?   Dolores kept 
picking up any of his clothes (except the fatal shorts) which he left 
about, but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions. 
He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets, 
so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers. The 
shorts alone remained.   In his moments of worst agony, Martin 
imagined what his friends were saying. The sound of their amazement. 
<Bizarre:> He could hear the word. <The most bizarre situation. 
We were up to visit them and> **h   He had thought her exactly 
what he wanted. Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense, 
he told himself furiously. Pursuing his idea, he saw that it would 
be impossible to leave her now. Everyone would know why; he would 
cut a supremely ridiculous figure.   He was trapped.   Day 
and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made 
for himself. His mind scurried frantically, seeking an exit. Alternately 
he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly, 
morosely, to live out his life in this fashion. Nothing would 
change, nothing would ever change.   When the solution finally 
came to him, one night while he was in bed, he was so shaken by its simplicity 
that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before.

In a frenzy of excitement, he considered his plan. 
Beside his shorts, he would place something of hers.   Instantaneously 
he would have won an immeasurable moral victory, for if she picked 
up, say, a pair of her panties, she might just as well lift his 
shorts lying alongside- the expenditure of energy was almost the same. 
He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick 
up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor. Furthermore, 
he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly: every time he went 
in the bedroom, he could drop a slip or a brassiere, or maybe a girdle, 
next to his shorts. Sooner or later, Dolores would crack. On the 
other hand, if she didn't remove her own things, it would be difficult 
to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment.

Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the 
next installment of her story. The tale, he thought, would become less 
gay. She had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness, 
his lack of control, his general male looseness, while she 
remained cool, airy, and untouched, the charming teacher who disciplined 
an unruly body. To have her underclothes linked with his on the floor 
would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd.

Something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence 
of the plan lay in his faith, that the idea would work because he believed 
in it, since his courage and virility were involved, because it 
was truly his. The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death, 
and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted 
fanaticism.   The next morning, while Dolores was out of 
the room, he went to her bureau drawer, took out a pair of nylon lace 
pants, and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts. He sat down on 
the bed.   In a surprisingly short time, Dolores appeared. To 
his delight, her eyes focused at once upon the two garments. Slowly and 
deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers, 
then hesitated for about a second. Ah, he thought, she's going through 
the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well 
pick up my shorts too. He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the 
implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him. Extending 
her fingers another inch, she caught up the shorts, and swiftly 
left the room. She did not look at him, but he noticed that her face 
was flushed and her eyes unsteady.   They breakfasted together, 
but Martin did not refer to his triumph, and Dolores found a great 
deal to do in the kitchen, bobbing up and down from the table so that 
talk was impossible. Well, Martin thought, That'll save. He left 
for work in high spirits.   As he relaxed that day, Martin realized 
how tense he had been these past weeks. He found that he no longer 
hated Dolores (he knew how much he had hated her), and he was 
surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling.

"Good old ~A-~Z", Cap said. "You know, I've got 
one of your cars at home. as a prominent industrialist, you ought to 
be interested in his nibs' support group. Isn't his racket down 
your alley"?   <Once it was>, William thought. <But not 
any more>.   A rush of memory swept him back, and he forgot Cap. 
How did he start on such a ride to brief glory? Simply enough, 
through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law. General Hershey's 
draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first 
eminence, but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit, if he cared 
to (and he did), for the second time. Freddy needed a job, having been 
detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper 
financing by Gerry, and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him 
with one.   Mr& Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products, a 
skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and 
whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long 
Island engaged in working out government contracts, and installed Freddy 
in an executive position. Shortly after, Freddy had his usual 
proliferation of bold ideas. Willis listened patiently, and once in a 
while William was exposed to them at a family gathering; he generally 
heard Freddy's suggestions without interest, being absorbed by 
his own prospering concerns.   Probably Mr& Willis was influenced 
toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for 
his grandchildren. Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father, prodded, 
no doubt, by Joan's open contempt for Freddy and William's irritating 
competency. Another factor must have been the eventual disposal 
of Willis' fortune; she unquestionably assumed that the more 
he was entwined with Freddy, the more likely he was to reward Freddy 
richly upon his death.   Whatever the reasons, Willis and Bryan 
started expanding Zenith. They acquired another electronics factory, 
a specialized ceramics company, an organization that built- very 
experimentally- high-speed research calculators. Since they were 
hunting for national defense contracts, Adam Herberet, a man of surprising 
resources, entered the combination as a silent partner because 
of his political connections.   Feeling his power, Freddy looked 
for additional worlds to conquer. Heavy industry, slanted toward inexhaustible 
government coffers, attracted him. The Allstates Auto 
Company, a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles 
and other off-road equipment, had recently constructed an over-large, 
modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism. Cursed with a shaky 
management and dissatisfied stockholders, it was ripe for amalgamation, 
and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and 
small expenditure of cash, and never mind inevitable consequences. With 
Herberet's blessing, he was convinced that Allstates' Wisconsin 
folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly, tanks, 
missiles or ordnance of some kind.   At that point William 
came into the picture. Although not much desiring the account, he had 
been appointed advertising head of Zenith. Freed of routine by having 
his own firm and a complaisant partner, his work in New York had 
given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate 
structure; and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he 
did, he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities. 
Mr& Willis, eager to have him allied with the family, wanted advice 
beyond the confines of his field, and William set out on a serious 
study of the situation, including trips to Wisconsin and Washington.

In the end, he said: "I'm not enchanted by the proposition, 
sir. I know a guy named Jack Hamrick, a very bright young 
engineer who was with Chrysler, and I took him with me to Allstates. 
It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what 
you have in mind. The conversion will cost a fortune. Besides that, 
I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through 
my contacts in the Air Force. I think Adam Herberet is guilty 
of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than 
on the technical side. Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs, 
and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here. The future of manned 
aircraft is in doubt, which affects government procurement, and jet 
transports have revolutionized the airline trade- one jet can take 
the place of three compound-engine planes. This means the aircraft companies 
are going to tear into the government market, looking for anything 
they can get and making the competition tough. Here are a few facts 
and figures I've assembled. Can't you stay with what you have 
and wait till the dust settles"?   Willis glanced at the bound 
pages given him and shrugged. "Well", he said, "there is Freddy, 
you know **h. And Gerry. Freddy is deeply committed to our 
plans already. He assures me he has people to handle the money raising, 
and Ham Richert, my lawyer, says the legal aspects of the wedding 
of Zenith and Allstates are no problem. I don't like to exhibit 
the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution". 
"Yes, I appreciate that. I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm 
lukewarm; I've caused him trouble before, and he's beginning 
to resent me. If we don't take care, the sisters will be entering the 
fray on opposite sides, brandishing their cudgels".   "Which 
is a frightful prospect, Bill". Willis laughed. "One shouldn't 
mix commercial affairs with patriarchy, but in this case I have 
no choice **h. Let me think about it. I'm most grateful to you, so 
grateful I wish you were my principal aide instead of Freddy".

Not to William's surprise, Freddy, Adam and Hamilton Richert 
prevailed; allied to them was Gerry, devoting much time to swaying 
her father, and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William 
was unwilling to interfere further. Zenith absorbed Allstates, 
stock transfers were arranged, and Freddy became president of the hyphenated 
combination. Through Jack Hamrick, William fell into the 
world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and 
Clay.   He forgot about ~A-~Z till, unhappily, he and Hamrick 
were proved correct. Freddy's backing dropped away from him 
and Mr& Willis was forced to make up the deficit. Adam, beset by 
changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the 
new corporation, couldn't deliver from his end. The Wisconsin plant 
turned out to be a white elephant. Stock Willis held in abundance 
fell sharply in value. Confronted by a grim future, Freddy lost his 
nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation.   Once more Willis 
summoned William. "You were right", he said- "you and your 
engineer- and I'm in something of a bind. Freddy's solution 
doesn't appeal to me. In addition to other defects, I'm a stubborn 
man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment. 
Will you see if you can help me"?   William spent a long 
week end closeted with Hamrick. His recent experience in motor car advertising, 
a love for cars of themselves, the existence of ~A-~Z's
