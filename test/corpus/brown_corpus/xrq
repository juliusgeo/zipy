youth. Also, he was weary of plantation drudgery and monotony.

So Dandy Brandon trustingly entered the house with Delphine 
Lalaurie and trudged up the rear steps to the attic room which was to 
be his new home. Airless and dingy though it was, the attic represented 
luxury to a slave who had led a wretched life with six brothers and 
sisters and assorted relatives in a shanty at Bayou St& John.

He bounced exuberantly on the sagging bed and was even more delighted 
when Madame Lalaurie- after closing the door- showed the 
slave that the bed was designed for something other than slumber.

It was just as well that the ignorant Dandy enjoyed himself to the 
hilt that first evening, for the room was to become his prison cell. 
When he finally left the sinister mansion on Perdido Street, he was 
carried out in a coroner's basket. ##

JUST six weeks after 
Dandy Brandon's arrival at the mansion, the little surgeon and 
his svelte young wife gave their annual open house and ball, to which 
only New Orleans' oldest and wealthiest families were invited.

A stringed orchestra played softly behind the potted palms, and Delphine 
circulated graciously among her guests, chatting airily of the 
forthcoming races, the latest fashions from Paris, and Louisiana 
politics.

Suddenly there was a commotion upstairs, a despairing 
boyish shriek, and the strains of the waltz faltered and died as the musicians 
and guests gaped at an apparition descending the marble staircase.

It was Dandy Brandon, clad only in a bloody loincloth, 
emaciated and quaking as if the devil were breathing hard on him. The 
lad's once superb body was a mass of scars and welts. His pinched 
face showed the ravages of malnutrition.   Feebly he pointed an 
accusing finger at Madame Lalaurie and shouted: "Evil woman! 
You did this **h you like to hurt **h to beat people **h I want **h 
to go home".   These were the last words he ever uttered. Convulsively, 
he spat up some blood and collapsed into the arms of Senator 
Gaston Berche, crimsoning the frilly shirt and waistcoat the politician 
wore.   Dr& Louis Lalaurie examined the inert form of 
the slave on the parquet dance floor and pronounced him dead. The ball 
broke up in confusion. Guests stared with horror at Madame Lalaurie 
and made speedy departures. Delphine stood like stone, 
her eyes alive 
with hate as she looked down at the sheeted corpse.   But at 
the coroner's inquest Delphine told a forthright story.   "I 
saw the boy Dandy at the Congo Square festivities and felt sorry 
for him. It was our hope to educate him and to give him his freedom 
when the right time came, for he was a bright and friendly youth who 
seemed worthy of our interest. After I paid <Monsieur> Prieur for 
Dandy, I brought him home, but he was ill at ease and ran away the 
same night. How he returned in such a ghastly condition, or why, I 
cannot say. Dr& Lalaurie and I didn't even know he was in the 
house until the night of our ball when he came down the stairs".

She daubed at her swimming eyes with a lacy handkerchief and said 
with obvious emotion: "That poor boy! He must have fallen in 
with evil companions, for he was a simple youth and quite trusting and 
inexperienced. Ruffians must have robbed and beaten him before bringing 
him back to our house to die. Such a pitiful end"!   Though 
the slave's dying words about the woman troubled the coroner's 
panel, Dandy's accusation was adjudged an aberration by the jury 
and disregarded. The Lalauries were at the top rung of the social ladder, 
and even a jury didn't feel privileged to doubt the veracity 
of so illustrious a lady. Moreover, runaway slaves frequently got into 
serious trouble in New Orleans' dives.   So the verict was 
"death at the hands of a person or persons unknown", and the elite 
of the city, accepting Delphine's testimony, welcomed her and the 
doctor back into the fold. Once again life went its serene way- soirees, 
fox hunts, balls and dinners.   The excitement over Brandon's 
bizarre death abated and Madame Lalaurie's stock soared when 
she resumed her self-imposed chores of visiting the poor and bringing 
cakes and comfort to destitute patients in the county hospital. Then, 
on July 2, there occurred another incident which set tongues to 
wagging at a furious clip.   Mrs& Victor Dominique, socially 
prominent and a neighbor of the Lalauries, chanced to glance out of 
her parlor window at dusk one evening and beheld an amazing sight. The 
manservant Devol and his mistress, Delphine Lalaurie, were pursuing 
a young girl- an octoroon of cameo-like beauty- across the front 
lawn of the Lalaurie mansion. The girl was not more than 16. She 
was nude to the waist and her tumbled abundance of black hair did not 
conceal the knife slashes on her back.   The bleeding girl was 
tiring fast; the coachman and Delphine were gaining on her as she raced 
down Perdido Street.   The fugitive cried out in an oddly 
sibilant voice: "Help me, somebody! They have pulled out all 
my teeth and now she will carve out my tongue with her hacksaw! 
"Bastards", he would say, "all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi 
stuff, and the first chair clobbered me"! Since then, and 
since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent- and 
even <in>decent- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero, 
he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper.   "There ain't 
nothin' faster, or lonelier, or more direct than a cannonball 
freight 
when you wanna go someplace", Feathertop would say. "The accommodations 
may not be the poshest, but man! there ain't nobody 
askin' for your 
ticket stub, neither".   He had been conning 
the freights for a long, long time now. Ever since the hooch, and the 
trouble with the Quartet, and Midge and the child. Ever since all 
that. It had been a very long time that had no form and no end.

He was- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer 
his own- riding the dark train out. Out and out and never to return 
again. Till one day the last freight had been jumped, the last pint 
had been killed, the last beat had been rapped. That was the day it 
ended. ##

THE FREIGHT CAR WAS COLD, early in the morning.

He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks, 
the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering 
the sound of his ocarina.   He held his elbows away from his 
body, and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled 
its tune-belly.   The train slowed at a road crossing, and 
the big door slid open; at first gratingly, caught by grains of corn- 
then with a clash into its slot.   The boy lifted the girl 
by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor. She pulled her legs 
up under her, to rise, her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs, and 
Feathertop's music <pffft>-ed away. 
"Now that is a very nice, 
a very nice", he murmured to himself, back in his corner.   A 
little thing, but the right twist for the action that counted. Hot, 
that was the word, hot! Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's 
wings, with the sun shining down over them. A poet, yet! His thoughts 
for the swanlike neck, the full, high breasts, the slim waist, and 
the long legs were less than poetic, however.   <Zingggg-O!>

Then the boy straight-armed himself up, twisting at the last 
moment so he landed sitting.   He was less to see, but Feathertop 
took him in, too, just to keep the records straight.   Curly 
hair, high cheekbones, wide gnomelike mouth, a pair of drummer's 
blocky hands, and a body that said well, maybe I can wrestle you for 
ten minutes- but then I'm finished.   "We made it, Cappy", 
the chick said.   "Yeah, seems so, don't it", the boy 
laughed, hugging her close.   "<Ah>-ah"! Feathertop interrupted, 
standing up, brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants. 
"None of that. We run a respectable house here".   They whirled 
and saw him, standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded 
freight wall. He was big, and filthy, and his toes stuck out of 
the flapping tops of his shoes. He held the black plastic kazoo lightly.

"Come sit", said Feathertop, motioning them toward 
him. "That crap is softer over here".   The girl smiled, and 
started forward. The boy yanked her back hard, tugging her off her 
feet, and gathered her into the crook of his arm.   "Now stay 
with me, Kitty", he snapped irritably. "I vowed to take care of 
you- and that's what I'm gonna do. We don't know this guy".

"Oooo, square bit", Feathertop screwed his face up. This 
guy was strictly from Outsville. But <no>where!   "What 
is with this <vow> jazz"? Feathertop inquired, lounging against 
the freight's vibrating wall.   "We- we eloped", Cappy 
said. His head came up and he said it defiantly.   "Well, 
congratulations". Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand. 
These two were going to be easy pickins. They couldn't have much 
dough, but then <none> of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had 
much. And besides, the chick had a little something the others didn't 
have. <That> was gonna be fun collecting!   But not just 
yet. Feathertop was a connoisseur. He liked to savor his meat before 
he tasted it. "Come sit", he repeated, motioning to the piled 
hay bags, over the pig leavings. "I'm just a poor ex-jazz man, name 
of- uh- Boyd Smith". He grinned at them wolfishly.

"That ain't your name, Mister", the boy accused.   "And 
you know- you're <right"!> Feathertop aimed a finger at 
him.   "Oh, <come> on, Cappy", the girl chided. "He's 
okay. He's a nice guy". She started to move toward the hay bags, 
dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her.   Feathertop watched 
the smooth scissoring of her slim, trim legs as she walked to the bags, 
and tucked them beneath her, smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle. 
He cleared his throat; it had been a long, hot while since he'd 
seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance. 
He had it all doped, of course. Slug the kid, grab his dough- at least 
enough to get to Philadelphia- and then have a rockin' ball 
with the doll. Hmm- diddle!   "Where'd you come from, 
Mr&- uh- Mr& Smith"? Kitty inquired politely.   "Where 
from"? he mused. "Out. I been riding train for a ways 
now".   They lapsed into silence, and the freight wallowed up 
a hill, scooted down the other side, shaking and clanking to itself.

After a while, Kitty murmured something to Cappy, and he held 
her close, answering, "We'll just have to wait till we pull into 
Philly, honey".   "What's the matter, she wanna go the 
bathroom"? Ernie found it immensely funny.   The boy scowled 
at him, and the girl looked shocked.   "No! Certainly not, 
I mean, <no> that isn't what I said"! she snapped at him. 
"I only said I was hungry. We haven't had anything to eat all 
day".   Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice 
as he reached behind him, pulling out a battered carpet bag, with 
leather handles. "Whyn't ya say so, fellow travelers! Why, we 
got dinner right here. C'mon, buddy, help me set up the kitchen and 
we'll have food in a minute or two".   Cappy looked wary, 
but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to 
the center of the refuse-littered boxcar.   Ernie crouched and 
opened the carpet bag. He took out a small packet filled with bits of 
charcoal, a deep pot of thin metal, some sheets of newspaper, a book 
of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with 
holes in it. He put the charcoal in the pot, lit the paper with the 
matches, and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot.
