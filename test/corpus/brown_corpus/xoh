beams may be split and directed to both the top and bottom of the 
food package to be irradiated. Selection of a source for commercial irradiation 
would involve consideration of numerous factors including required 
dose rate, load factor, throughput, convenience, safety, and most 
important, costs.   Of the potentially useful sources of ionizing 
radiations, gamma sources, cobalt-60, cesium-137, fission products, 
or a reactor irradiation loop system using a material such as an indium 
salt have received most attention for food-preservation systems. 
Of the various particle accelerators, the Van de Graff machines, resonant 
transformers, and linear accelerators are the principal ones available 
for commercial use.   Costs of the effective energy produced 
by these sources is a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation 
processes. Estimated production costs of radiation energy 
from machine and nuclide sources range from $1 to $10 per ~kwhr. Conventional 
energy for processing foods is available in the range of 
at most a few cents per ~kwhr for electric power and the equivalent 
of a few mills per ~kwhr for process steam. Radiation, therefore, is 
at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent as 
much radiation energy as heat energy is required for radiopasteurization 
or radiosterilization. What are the possibilities of lowered radiation 
production costs for the future? It has been estimated that for 
applications on a megawatt scale costs might reach values in the neighborhood 
of 10 cents per ~kwhr for large-scale accelerators or for 
gamma radiation generated in a reactor core. No comparable reductions 
in the cost of nuclide radiation are foreseen. Such projections, however, 
appear highly 
speculative and the capacities involved are far beyond 
those foreseen for food-preservation facilities.   Because agricultural 
activities are seasonal and the areas of production and harvest 
of many foods are widely scattered geographically, and because of 
the high cost of transporting bulk food items any substantial distance 
to a central processing location, the use of large central processing 
stations, where low-cost radiation facilities approaching the megawatt 
range might be utilized, is inherently impracticable. 

#PRESENT STATUS 
OF IRRADIATION PRESERVATION OF FOODS#

The objective of complete 
sterilization of foods is to produce a wholesome and palatable product 
capable of being stored without refrigeration for extended periods 
of time. Chief interest in radiosterilization resides in the military 
services. For them, providing appetizing food under battle or emergency 
conditions is a paramount consideration. They require completely 
sterile foods capable of being stored without refrigeration, preferably 
items already cooked and ready to eat. High nutritional value, variety, 
palatability, and appetizing appearance are important for reasons 
of morale. Foods for rear stations, which require cooking, but no refrigeration, 
are also of interest. Of primary interest are meats.

Radiopasteurization, which produces fewer adverse sensory changes 
in food products, has potential usefulness in prolonging the keeping 
qualities of fresh and refrigerated food items. Thus, food so processed 
might reach more remote markets and permit the consumer to enjoy more 
produce at peak freshness and palatability. Commercial interest is chiefly 
in this type of treatment, as is military interest under peacetime 
conditions.   The present status of food preservation by ionizing 
radiation is discussed by food classes in the following paragraphs. 
_MEATS_ The radiation processing of meat has received extensive 
investigation. To date, the one meat showing favorable results at 
sterilization doses is pork. Of particular interest to the military 
services is the demonstration that roast pork, after radiosterilization, 
is superior in palatability to available canned pork products. Tests 
with beef have been largely unsuccessful because of the development 
of off-flavors. A prime objective of the Army Quartermaster Corps 
program is to find the reasons for beef's low palatability and means 
of overcoming it, since it is a major and desirable dietary item. Partly 
because low-level heat treatment is needed to inactivate enzymes 
before radiosterilization, treated fresh meats have the appearance of 
boiled or canned meat.   Off-flavor is a less severe problem with 
the radiopasteurization of meats, but problems of commercial acceptability 
remain. Moderate radiation doses of from 100,000 to 200,000 ~rads 
can extend the shelf life (at 35 ~F) of fresh beef from 5 days 
to 5 or 6 weeks. However, the problem of consumer acceptability remains. 
The preradiation blanching process discolors the treated beef 
and liquid accumulates in prepackaged cuts. Cooked beef irradiated in 
the absence of oxygen assumes an unnatural pink color.   When lamb 
and mutton are irradiated at substerilization doses, the meat becomes 
dehydrated, the fat become chalky, and, again, unnatural changes in 
color occur.   Ground meats such as fresh pork sausage and hamburger 
have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration, and radiopasteurization 
might be thought to offer distinctly improved keeping 
qualities. However, a major problem here is one of scale of processing; 
ground meats are usually prepared from scrap meats at the local 
level, whereas irradiation at economic volumes of production would require 
central processing and distribution facilities. The problems of 
color change by blanching and liquid accumulation within the package are 
the same as for solid cuts.   Specialty cooked items containing 
meat portions, as in "frozen dinners" might offer a potential use 
for radiopasteurization. The principal potential advantage would be 
that the finished product could be transported and stored at lower cost 
under refrigeration instead of being frozen. A refrigerated item 
could also be heated and served in less time than is required for frozen 
foods of the same type.   Competitive processes for preserving 
meats are by canning and freezing. Costs of canning meat are in the 
range of 0.8 to 5 cents per pound; costs of freezing are in the area 
of 2 to 3.5 cents per pound. The table on page 10 shows costs of canning 
and freezing meat, and estimated costs for irradiation under certain 
assumed conditions. Under the conditions of comparison, it will 
be noted that: _(1)_ Radiosterilization (at 3 ~Mrad) is more 
expensive than canning, particularly for the cesium-137 source. _(2)_ 
Radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137 
source is in the range of freezing costs. _(3)_ Irradiation 
using the nuclide source is more expensive than use of an electron accelerator. 
_POULTRY_ Results of irradiation tests with poultry have 
been quite successful. At sterilizing doses, good palatability results, 
with a minimum of changes in appearance, taste, and odor. Radiopasteurization 
has also been successful, and the shelf life of chicken 
can be extended to a month or more under refrigerated storage as compared 
with about 10 days for the untreated product. Acceptable taste and 
odor are retained by the irradiated and refrigerated chicken. Acceptance 
of radiopasteurization is likely to be delayed, however, for two 
reasons: (1) the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration 
is becoming a minimal problem because of constantly improved sanitation 
and distributing practices, and (2) treatment by antibiotics, a measure 
already approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, 
serves to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 0.5 
cent per pound. _SEAFOOD_ Fresh seafood products are extremely 
perishable. Although refrigeration has served to extend the storage 
life of these products, substantially increased consumption might be possible 
if areas remote from the seacoast could be served adequately. 
Furthermore, it has made an exact assessment of the removal mechanisms 
possible.   The instrument is shown in Fig& 1 and consists 
essentially of a hard, sharp, tungsten carbide knife which is pushed 
along the substrate to remove the coating. The force required to accomplish 
removal is plotted, by means of an electronic recorder, against 
distance of removal. Since the removal force is a function of coating 
thickness, a differential transformer pickup has been incorporated into 
the instrument to accurately measure film thickness. This, too, is 
recorded against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously 
cut. A number of adjustment features are included in the Hesiometer 
to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coatings deposited 
on such substrates as iron and other metals, glass, wood, and 
plastic surfaces. The measurement of topcoats on primers can also readily 
be carried out.   Hesiometer results have been found to compare 
excellently with manual knife scratching tests. The instrumental 
method, however, is about 100 times more sensitive and yields numerical 
results which can be accurately repeated at wil over a period of time. 
If a wedge-shaped coating of increasing thickness is removed from 
a substrate by an instrument like the Hesiometer with a knife of constant 
rake angle, a number of removal mechanisms are often observed 
which depend upon the thickness of the coating. At low thicknesses a 
cutting (or shearing) phenomenon is often encountered. As the coating 
becomes thicker, the cutting may abruptly change to a cracking type of 
failure. If the coating becomes still thicker, a peeling type failure 
finally can occur. The typical appearance of these various mechanisms 
is illustrated in Figs& 2, 3, and 4, which are single frame enlargements 
of high speed movies taken during the course of the knife removal 
process. It can be seen from Fig& 2 that the cutting removal 
of a coating from its substrate involves pure cohesive failure of the 
coating. The molecular forces holding the coating to the substrate are 
obviously greater than the cohesive strength of the coating and 
failure occurs by shear along a plane starting at the tip of the knife 
and extending to the coating surface.   The pictures of Figs& 
3 and 
4 show the cracking and peeling types of removal where the coating 
is detached by failure in a region at, or close to, the interface between 
coating and substrate.   If the force required to remove the 
coatings is plotted against film thickness, a graph as illustrated schematically 
in Fig& 5 may characteristically result. Here, ~<H> 
is the coatings removal force measured parallel to the surface of the 
substrate and ~<t> is the film thickness. It can be seen that 
the force is characteristic of the removal process and changes abruptly 
from cutting to cracking to peeling removal. Also, it can be readily 
seen that the cutting and peeling types of failure show a steady state 
response, while the cracking mechanism is of a dynamic nature.

It should be recalled that these three mechanisms can occur on the 
same coating deposited upon the same substrate merely as a function of 
changes in coatings thickness. Presumably the interfacial bond strength 
and gross cohesive properties are identical in each case. What then, 
are the factors that contribute to these phenomena? Why should 
the "practical adhesion" of a coating as assessed by a knife method 
change, initially increasing rather rapidly and then decreasing stepwise 
to very low values as the knife is forced through a coating of increasing 
thickness? 

#CUTTING MECHANISM OF COHESIVE FAILURE#

The 
cutting (or shearing) removal process has been previously described. 
It was found that the coating is separated from its substrate entirely 
by cohesive failure. The details of the removal process are shown 
schematically in Fig& 6. The various forces result from the reaction 
of the removed paint chip against the face of the knife and along 
the shear plane, which makes an angle ~|f with the substrate. The 
action and reaction forces are ~<R> and **f, respectively and 
are equal and opposite in direction. All the other force vectors are 
derived from these. **f is the force required to cut a coating of thickness 
~<t> from the substrate. **f is the shear force along the shear 
plane; **f and **f are the thrust forces acting against coating 
and knife, respectively; **f is the normal compressive force acting 
on the shear plane; **f is the friction force between chip and knife 
surfaces, and ~<P> is the normal force acting on the face of the 
knife. ~|a is the rake angle of the knife; ~|f is the angle 
the shear plane makes with the substrate; ~|t is the friction 
angle; and ~|b is the angle the resultants make with the plane of 
the substrate.   An analysis of the vector relationships shows 
that the rake angle ~|a and the friction angle ~|t determine 
the vector direction **f of the force resultants ~<R> and **f. Consequently,
