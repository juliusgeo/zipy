three campgrounds in this 70 mile-long National Seashore Recreation 
Area. Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often, look 
at the equipment and talk with the campers. Here you begin to appreciate 
the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.

Camping is big and getting bigger. No one knows where it will 
stop. Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement 
of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of 
all outdoor markets. You read various guesses on how many Americans 
are camping. The number depends on who is talking at the moment. The 
figures range as high as 15 million families. I've heard 10 million 
mentioned often, but I'm more inclined to think there may be a 
total of some five to seven million families camping. Seven million families 
would total 30 million Americans or more. Consider the equipment 
needed to protect this many from the weather, to make their cooking 
easy and their sleeping comfortable. 

#MORE CAMPERS THAN CAMPSITES# 

Harassed state park officials often have more campers than they 
know what to do with. They are struggling to meet the demand for camping 
space, but families are being turned away, especially on holiday 
weekends. The National Parks, always popular camping places, are facing 
the same pressure. The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to 
have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day- almost 
twice what there are at present. The U& S& Forest Service cares 
for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests 
and is increasing its facilities steadily.   But the campers still 
come. They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding. 
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits. 
They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing 
numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation 
that becomes a family experience of lasting importance. 

#WHY THEY 
KEEP COMING#

There are a half dozen reasons helping to account for 
the migration to the campgrounds. Among them, according to the U& 
S& Department of Commerce, are: (1) shorter work weeks, (2) 
higher pay, (3) longer paid vacations, (4) better transportation, (5) 
earlier retirement, and (6) more education. The more people learn about 
their country, the more they want to learn. Camping is family fun, 
and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever 
saw before.   But make no mistake about it, the first reason 
people turn to camping is one of economy. Here is the promise of a vacation 
trip they can afford.   The American Automobile Association, 
computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes 
up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29. The ~AAA 
then splits it down this way: $10.50 for meals, $9.50 for lodging, 
$7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.   What does 
the camping couple do to this set of figures? The $9.50 for lodging 
they save. Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in 
their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most 
of the tip money. The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing 
cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping 
along the way.   Where Americans used to think of a single 
vacation each summer, they now think about how many vacations they 
can have. Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or 
four days several times a year. And even if they stay in resorts part 
of the time, they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow, develop 
a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip 
into the wide open spaces.   It would be a mistake to sell those 
thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts 
of home. They're not. Home is the place to find the comforts of 
home. They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences. But 
it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable 
camping has become. This is no longer a way of life for the bearded 
logger and the wandering cowboy. Today's campers want comforts, and 
they have them. And this helps explain why so many people are now going 
camping. It's fun, and it's easy- so easy that there is time 
left after cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out and 
enjoy outdoor fun with their families.   Camp meals are no great 
problem. Neither are beds, thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags. 
Neither are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs of every 
camper or prospective camper.   But there is still the sometimes 
complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for 
their individual needs. 
@ Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance has become 
the commander of others- for good or bad. Since the Industrial 
Revolution, when factories emerged, this classical pattern has been 
followed. {Until recently.}   There have always been tales 
of disillusionment- the competent technician who became an administrator, 
willingly or not, and found he didn't like it; the scientist 
who rebelled against the personnel and paper work; and much more 
commonly in recent years, the engineer who found that other duties interfered 
with- or eliminated- his engineering contributions. {There 
have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into 
very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work, to their own and 
the public's dissatisfaction and loss.}   This has been more 
evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased 
technology. The remedies have been many and varied- attempts to 
teach management techniques- either in plant, at special schools, 
or 
in university "crash" courses- provision of management-trained assistants 
or associates. {But the realization has been growing that 
these are not the complete answer.} Some men have no talent for or 
interest in management; forcing them into management can only create 
trouble. The old shop adage still holds: "A good mechanic is usually 
a bad boss".   Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition 
of managerial status as the gage of success. Labor fights to 
change its collar from blue to white. All grades of management seek 
more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures. As several 
recent books have over-emphasized, {we have become the most status-conscious 
nation in the world.}   {What can be done for 
the "individual contributor"} who is extremely important- and 
likely to be more so- in the operation of the technically oriented 
company? He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and 
outside; usually concerned about America's belief that attainment 
and success are measured in dollars and titles. Yet titles are traditionally 
given only to management men, and income tends to rise with 
title.   Even the college professor in America has been affected. 
It is, as one engineer says, "indeed a difficult thing for the 
engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he 
could employing managerial skills. This difficulty arises even though 
we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course. This 
leads one to conclude, as you have, that there is inevitably more 
prestige in a management position in the minds of our people".

Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than 
engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers. So we asked such 
men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on 
the "dual-road-up" problem- and more importantly- their solutions. 
In the paragraphs that follow, we quote from 32 men who are identified 
on the final page. 

#FIRST: WHAT TITLE, WHAT SETUP?#

Among 
the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of 
General Electric. {This is not a mutually exclusive plan; there 
is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the 
technical or the managerial path upward. Further, the management path 
does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by 
the more technical path. It is common to shift back and forth, working 
up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.}

Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor 
positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide "services" 
operation that are filled by men with successful managerial 
experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.   Also, 
moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's 
recognition as a technical expert. As examples at ~GE: Glen 
B& Warren, formerly manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized 
as a turbine designer. The late W& R& G& Baker, a pioneer 
in television design and long-time ~vp + ~gm of the Electronics 
Division, and later, by his own choice, an individual consultant. 
Harold E& Strang, expert in switchgear design, for a long period 
~vp + ~gm of the Measurements + Industrial Products Division, 
and who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president and consulting 
engineer in the Switchgear + Control Division.   In 
the ~GE plan, a number of individual contributors have positions 
and compensation higher than those of many managers. These positions 
carry such titles as:   Consultant- Advanced Development

Consulting Engineer   Consulting Engineer- Heat Transfer

Consulting Electrical Engineer   Senior Electrical 
Engineer   Senior Physicist   Westinghouse has a similar 
system, with two classifications representing various levels of competence 
on the strictly technical side: consulting engineer or scientist, 
as the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist. Many 
companies have systems, particularly in ~R + ~D, which work more 
or less well, depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on 
the part of administration, as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent 
quotations.   Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel 
recognition is, as one man says it: "**h that the fad for educating 
top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically 
trained approach". _SENIOR STAFF ENGINEER?_ One company instituted, 
early in 1959, a vertical classification system consisting of four 
levels. There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks; 
the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer, enjoys status 
and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision. 
The second level, senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level 
supervision. The expectation is that first-level supervisors will 
be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third 
engineering level, with very few coming from the first level.

The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for 
non-supervisory engineers, but probably not into executive levels. 
{In this organization, about half of the engineers with 15 or more 
years of employment are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere.} This 
reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products- which 
are not military. Several other examples: _CENTRAL AND SATELLITE_ 
"We have over 20 divisions- each of which has an engineering 
department headed by a chief engineer. We have set up a central ~R 
+ ~D department, as well as engineering-management departments- 
about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants. 
A separate research department is, of course, confined to new or future 
designs. Part of this headquarters staff, however, are engineering 
managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters 
management. These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president- 
Engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers and chief 
engineers on product problems as well as aid with design; and many are 
engineers who have been advanced from the divisions. These men are 
considered managers of engineers. They must learn to wear several hats, 
so to speak, working with management, sales and engineering problems 
related to the product.   "We do not have people in our organization 
termed 'consultants' or 'fellows', who are specialists 
in one particular technical subject. I suppose it is because we are
