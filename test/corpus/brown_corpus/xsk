staircase that opened to her left. The Spanish Steps. 
Something special was going on here just now- the annual display of 
azalea plants. She had heard about it the night before at her hotel. 
It was not yet complete: workmen were unloading the potted plants 
from 
a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above. The azaleas 
were as large as shrubs, and their myriad blooms, many still tight 
in the bud, ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to 
the palest pink, along with many white ones too. Marvelous, thought 
Theresa, climbing in her portly, well-bred way, for she was someone 
who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to 
notice everything. In Rome, all over Europe, she intended to move very 
slowly indeed.   Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat 
down. Other people were doing it, too, sitting all along the wide banisters 
and leaning over the parapets above, watching the azaleas mass, 
or just enjoying the sun. Theresa sat with her letters in her lap, 
breathing Mediterranean air. The sun warmed her, as it seemed to be 
warming everything, perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill 
insides of churches. She loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette. 
Content **h excited; how could you be both at once? Strange, 
but she was. Presently, she picked up the first of the letters.

A few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted 
with anxiety and dismay. <Of course, one of them would have 
to go and do this! Poor Cousin Elec,> she thought, tears rising 
to sting in the sun, <but why couldn't he have arranged to live 
through the summer? And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway?>

She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had 
managed to find her. Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written it, in her 
loose high old lady's script- ~t's carefully crossed, but 
~l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope. Cousin 
Emma had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield, Rome, Italy, 
on the envelope, had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka, Alabama, 
and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday 
card to her next-door neighbor. No return address whatsoever. Somebody 
had scrawled American Express, Piazza di Spagna?, across the 
envelope, and now Theresa had it, all as easily as if she had been 
the 
President of the Republic or the Pope. Inside were all the things 
they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness, death, 
and 
burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway.   Cousin Emma and Cousin 
Elec, brother and sister- unmarried, devoted, aging- had lived 
next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until 
the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago. 
Two days before he was taken sick, Cousin Elec was out worrying about 
what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas, and Cousin Elec had 
always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl 
paper 
knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised 
she could have when he died. <I'm supposed to care as much now 
as then, as much here as there,> she realized, with a sigh. <This letter 
would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome, Italy, on 
it>.   She refolded the letter, replaced it in its envelope, 
and turned with relief to one from her brother George.   But alas 
George, when <he> had written, had only just returned from going 
to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral. He was full of heavy family 
reminiscence. All the fine old stock was dying out, look at the world 
today. His own children had suffered from the weakening of those 
values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted, and as for 
his grandchildren (he had one so far, still in diapers), he shuddered 
to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them 
at all. A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived 
had to be known at first hand **h.   Poor George! The only 
boy, the family darling. Together with her mother, both of them tense 
with worry lest things should somehow go wrong. Theresa had seen 
him through the right college, into the right fraternity, and though 
pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls, safely married to 
the right sort, however much in the early years of that match his wife, 
Anne, had not seemed to understand poor George. Could it just be, 
Theresa wondered, that Anne had understood only too well, and that 
George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was 
dull?   As for Cousin Alexander Carraway, the only thing 
Theresa could remember at the moment about him (except his paper knife) 
was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night 
about one o'clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had 
been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma's call- first Papa, 
then Mother, then Theresa and George. There they all did their 
uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot. He had 
hobbled downstairs into the parlor, in his agony, and was sitting, wrapped 
in his bathrobe, on a footstool. He held his long clenched foot 
in both hands, and this and his contorted face- he was trying heroically 
not to cry out- made him look like a large skinny old monkey. They 
all surrounded him, the family circle, Theresa and George as solemn 
as if they were watching the cat have kittens, and Cousin Emma 
running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming 
into a white enamelled pan. "Can you think of anything to do"? 
she kept repeating. "I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps 
up I'll just have to! Can you think of anything to do"? 
"You might treat it like the hiccups", said Papa. "Drop a cold 
key down his back". "I just hope this happens to you someday", 
said Cousin Elec, who was not at his best. "Poor Cousin Elec", 
George said. He was younger than Theresa: she remembered looking 
down and seeing his great round eyes, while at the same time she was 
dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused. "Poor 
Cousin Elec".   Now, here they both were, still the same, George 
full of round-eyed woe, and Cousin Emma in despair. Theresa shifted 
to a new page.   "Of course (George's letter continued), 
there are practical problems to be considered. Cousin Emma is alone 
in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it. Robbie 
and Beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them, 
and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here, but 
I think she feels that she might be an imposition, especially as long 
as our Rosie is still in high school. The other possibility is to 
make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher 
of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka 
is populated with- Miss Edna Whittaker, for example. But there 
is more in this than meets the eye. A new bathroom would certainly 
have to be put in. The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling 
off **h". (Theresa skipped a page of details about the house.) 
"I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write 
me about them. I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer 
and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together 
the best **h".   I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette 
so early in the day, thought Theresa, it always makes me sick. I'll 
start sneezing in a minute, sitting on these cold steps. She got 
up, standing uncertainly for a moment, then moving aside to let go past 
her, talking, a group of young men. They wore shoes with pointed toes, 
odd to American eyes, and narrow trousers, and their hair looked 
unnaturally black and slick. Yet here they were obviously thought to 
be handsome, and felt themselves to be so. Just then a man approached 
her with a tray of cheap cameos, Parker fountain pens, rosaries, papal 
portraits. "No", said Theresa. "No, no"! she said. The 
man did not wish to leave. He knew how to spread himself against the 
borders of the space that had to separate them. Carrozza rides in 
the park, the Colosseum by moonlight, he specialized **h. Theresa turned 
away to escape, and climbed to a higher landing where the steps 
divided in two. There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant 
section of banister, while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed 
American lady, carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag, 
ascending the steps alone. Was he ever successful, Theresa wondered. 
The lady with the alligator bag registered interest, doubt, then indignation; 
at last, alarm. She cast about as though looking for a policeman: 
this really shouldn't be allowed! Finally, she scurried 
away up the steps.   Theresa Stubblefield, still holding the 
family letters in one hand, realized that her whole trip to Europe was 
viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec's 
death and "doing something" about Cousin Emma. They were even, 
Anne and George, probably thinking themselves very considerate in not 
hinting that she really should cut out "one or two countries" 
and come home in August to get Cousin Emma's house ready before the 
teachers came to Tuxapoka in September. Of course, it wasn't Anne 
and George's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another, 
and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't 
know what they would do without Theresa? <The trouble is,> Theresa 
thought, <that while everything that happens there is supposed to 
matter supremely, nothing here is supposed even to exist. They would 
not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow. It 
never registered with them that I had time to real all of Balzac, Dickens, 
and Stendhal while Papa was dying, not to mention everything 
in the city library after Mother's operation. It would have been 
exactly the same to them if I had read through all twenty-six volumes 
of Elsie Dinsmore>.   She arranged the letters carefully, one 
on top of the other. Then, with a motion so suddenly violent that she 
amazed herself, she tore them in two.   "Signora"?

She became aware that two Italian workmen, carrying a large azalea 
pot, were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could 
begin arranging a new row of the display.   "Mi diapiace, 
signora, ma **h insomma **h".   "Oh **h put it there"! 
She indicated a spot a little distance away.

I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield- that Lucille 
was a husband stealer. You can't keep that kind of information quiet 
in a town of only 4000-plus. And I've been told that just about 
every town, no matter what its size, has its Lucille Warren.

Just as it has its Susan Dolan, though nobody'd ever bothered to 
tell me that. Susan Dolan, that's me.   They even talked about 
Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where I spent 
a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work 
for our foreign mission. I never heard my folks talk about her, though. 
They were good-living religious people, and I can truthfully say 
I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody. Even if they ever 
did say anything about people like Lucille Warren, I know they wouldn't 
have dreamed of saying it in front of me. My folks and my faith 
protected me from things like that.   And so I was really upset 
the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing 
Mrs& warren. 
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting 
in his truck. I asked him if it was true.   He gave me a straight, 
honest answer. "Look, Sue baby", he'd said. Much as I 
love you- well, a guy's a guy and Lucille's willing to- 
to come across. Honest, kitten, that's all it is- I don't even 
like Lucille much".   I guess it was at that moment that I 
realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren. But 
it didn't seem fair. My love for Johnnie was young and clean- 
how could I possibly compete with a woman like that, who didn't hesitate 
to use her sex.   Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber 
outfit in a town about twenty miles away, and he was also pretty good 
at anything in the carpentry line. It was a vivid, sharp February 
morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard, bringing 
some stuff Dad had ordered. I wasn't in the habit of batting 
my eyes at delivery men, but the moment I saw Johnnie, I knew he was 
different. He wasn't only different- he was <it>. He had an 
easy masculine grace about him, the kind that kids don't have, but 
that I had sometimes admired in other older men. His smile was quick, 
and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp.
