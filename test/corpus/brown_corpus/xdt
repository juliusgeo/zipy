families place undue emphasis on food: conversations center on it, 
and rich delicacies are offered as rewards, withheld as punishment. The 
result says Jolliffe: "The child gains the feeling that food 
is the purpose of life". Food may act as a sedative, giving temporary 
emotional solace, just as, for some people, alcohol does. Reports 
Dr& Keys: "A fairly common experience for us is the wife who 
finds her husband staying out more and more. He may be interested in 
another woman, or just like being with the boys. So she fishes around 
in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake. It's a matter of 
boredom, and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something, 
because she's being deprived of something else".   For the 
army of compulsive eaters- from the nibblers and the gobblers to 
the downright gluttons- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely 
won. Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants 
as the amphetamines 
(Benzedrine, Dexedrine) as dangerous "crutches 
for a weak will".   Keys has no such objections to Metrecal, 
Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are 
currently winning favor from dieters. "Metrecal is a pretty complete 
food", he says. "It contains large amounts of protein, vitamins 
and minerals. In the quantity of 900 calories a day, anyone will lose 
weight on it- 20, 30 or 40 lbs&". But Keys worries that the 
Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological 
adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food. 

#THAT 
REMARKABLE CHOLESTEROL.#

Despite his personal distaste for obesity 
("disgusting"), Dr& Keys has only an incidental interest 
in how much Americans eat. What concerns him much more is the relationship 
of diet to the nation's No& 1 killer: coronary artery disease, 
which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 
500,000 Americans a year- twice the toll from all varieties of 
cancer, five times the deaths from automobile accidents.   Cholesterol, 
the cornerstone of Dr& Keys's theory, is a mysterious 
yellowish, 
waxy substance, chemically a crystalline alcohol. Scientists 
assume that cholesterol (from the Greek <chole,> meaning bile, and 
<sterios,> meaning solid) is somehow necessary for the formation of 
brain cells, since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total 
solid weight. They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones. They 
suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones, and 
they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the 
circulatory system. But they cannot fully explain the process of its 
manufacture by the human liver. Although the fatty protein molecules, 
carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol, are water soluble, 
cholesterol itself is insoluble, and cannot be destroyed by the 
body. "A remarkable substance", says Dr& Keys, "quite apart 
from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries".

When thus deposited, Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible 
for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks. Explains 
Keys: As the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream, 
they are deposited in the intima, or inner wall of a coronary artery. 
The proteins and fats are burned off, and the cholesterol is left 
behind. As cholesterol piles up, it narrows, irritates and damages the 
artery, encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation. 
Eventually, says Keys, one of two things happens. A clot forms 
at the site, seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes 
a heart attack. Or (more commonly, thinks Keys) the deposits themselves 
get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that 
an infarct occurs: the heart muscle is suffocated, cells supplied 
by the artery die, and the heart is permanently, perhaps fatally injured. 

#FATS + CORONARIES.#

Ordinarily, the human liver synthesizes 
only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs- for transportation 
of fats and for production of bile. Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich 
foods, eaten in normal amounts, says Dr& Keys, do not materially 
affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood. But fatty foods 
do.   During World War /2,, doctors in The Netherlands 
and Scandinavia noted a curious fact: despite the stresses of Nazi 
occupation, the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping. 
Not until long after the war- 1950, in fact- did they get 
a hint of the reason. That year, Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed 
that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe 
restrictions on fatty foods. That same year the University of California's 
Dr& Laurance Kinsell, timing oxidation rates of blood 
fats, stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood 
cholesterol levels to drop radically, while animal fats cause them to 
rise. Here Keys and others, such as Dr& A& E& Ahrens of 
the Rockefeller Institute, took over to demonstrate the chemical difference 
between vegetable and animal fats- and even between different 
varieties of each.   All natural food fats fall into one of three 
categories- saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated. 
The 
degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the 
fat molecule. Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens. Mono-unsaturated 
fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule, 
and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens.

The three fats have similar caloric values (about 265 calories 
per oz&), but each exerts a radically different influence on 
blood cholesterol. 
As a result, although we still make use of this distinction, there is 
much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed. Just what 
is meant by "spirit" and by "matter"? The terms are generally 
taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic 
elements in the common experience of all. Yet in the contemporary 
context this is precisely what one must not do. For in the modern world 
neither "spirit" nor "matter" refer to any generally agreed-upon 
elements of experience. We are in a transitional stage in which 
many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected. 
When the words are used, we are never sure which of the traditional 
meanings the user may have in mind, or to what extent his revisions 
and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours.

One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the 
almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit. Just a few centuries 
ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of 
material entities. Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly 
educated as well was this true. Demons, fairies, angels, and a host 
of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential 
world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars. In such a world 
the words "matter" and "spirit" both referred to directly 
known realities in the common experience of all. In it important elements 
of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general, 
which now cause us much difficulty, could be responded to quite naturally 
and spontaneously.   The progress of science over these last 
few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific 
categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world 
of the entities which previously populated it. In carrying out this 
program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service 
for which it can claim due credit. The objectification of the world 
of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the 
experience of spirit could justify or support. Science is fully competent 
to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object 
in space and time. When, therefore, it turned its attention to the 
concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world 
of spirit, these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed 
as actual elements of external reality. In doing so science has unquestionably 
cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous 
and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable popular 
superstitions. There have been, indeed, many important and valuable gains 
from the development of our present scientific view of the world 
for which we may be rightly grateful.   All this has not, however, 
been an unmixed blessing. The scientific debunking of the spirit world 
has been in a way too successful and too thorough. The house has 
been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means, 
or at best with wholly inadequate means, for dealing with his experience 
of spirit. Although the particular form of conceptualization which 
popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit 
was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience itself which led to such 
excesses remains with us as vividly as ever. We simply find ourselves 
in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure 
and meaning of this range of our experience. There is no framework 
or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and 
no part 
of reality, as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which we 
can refer this experience. Science has simply left us helpless and powerless 
in this important sector of our lives.   The situation in 
which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur 
Miller's play <The Crucible,> which deals with the Salem witch 
trials. As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community 
of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century. 
Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides 
the immediate problem in the opening scene, it is a quite normal community. 
The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting 
the usual mixture of pleasures, foibles, irritations, and concerns 
which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any 
age. There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people. 
Instead, the audience can sit back at ease and, from the perspective 
of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things, 
enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take 
the witches and devils which are under discussion. A teenage girl, Abigail 
Williams, is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle, 
the Reverend Samuel Parris, about a wild night affair in the woods 
in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with 
these evil beings. For all involved in this discussion the devil is 
a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night, 
the demon world is populated with real creatures, and witches actually 
can be seen flying through the air.   As the play unfolds, however, 
the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil 
which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community. 
Everyone in Salem, saint and sinner alike, is swept up by it. 
It is like a mysterious epidemic which, starting first with Abigail 
and Parris, spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through 
the whole town until all have been infected by it. It grows terribly 
and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery, 
moral disintegration, and destruction. The audience leaves the play 
under a spell, It is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit 
in its living active manifestation always evokes.   If one asks 
about this play, what it is that comes upon this community and works 
within it with such terrible power, there is no better answer to give 
than "spirit". This is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but 
only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a 
common experience. In the end the good man, John Proctor, expresses 
what the audience has already come to feel when he says, "A fire, 
a fire is burning! I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy 
face"! The tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and 
concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with 
formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from 
detecting the real devil when he came among them. We marvel at their 
blindness for not seeing this. Yet are not we of the mid-twentieth 
century, who rightly do not believe there is any such "thing" as the 
devil, just as bad off as they- only in a different way? In our 
disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are 
unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in
